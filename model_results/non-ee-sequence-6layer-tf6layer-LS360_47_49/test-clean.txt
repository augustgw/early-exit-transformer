test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that unite every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists sometimes as ker crests
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by beings studious of color they are studious of division and while the cure acre devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing unseated light a colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for believe me the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock robin is to be read and of a grass plot to be green and the best skill art is an instantly seizing on the manifold delicious ness of light which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nighty you will see in these studies that the moment the white is enclosed properly and harmonize with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of entreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds in the round windows will tell as jewels if they are graded justly

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do not therefore think that the gothic schools easy one
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the law of that schools that everything shall be seen clearly or at least only in such mis or faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative in decorative that a represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact you are producing jeweller's work rather than pictures
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in all early gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble an ill drawn figures that is merely child is some failing work of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquillity of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purest painting unless your actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you must look at him in the face fight him conquer him with what scathe you may you needed not think to keep out of the way of him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the colorist says first of all as my delicious parquet was ruby so this nasty viper shall be black and then is the question can i round him off even though he is black and make him slimy and yet springy and close down clotted like a pool of black blood on the earth all the same

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in both these highly mythical subjects the surrounding nature th suffering is still dignified and beautiful
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: every line in which the master traces it even were seemingly negligent is lovely and set down with a meditative calmness which makes these two etchings capable of being placed beside the most tranquil work of whole mine or dure

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it will be well for you if you join not with those who instead of kites fly falcons who instead of obeying the last words of the great clouds shepherd defeat his sheep live the lives how much less than vanity of the war wolf in the gurgle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: also a popular contrivance whereby love making may be suspended but not stopped during the picnic season

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thought kills me that i am not bought to leap large length of miles when thou art gone but that so much of earth and water wrought i must attend times leisure with my moan receding not by element so slow but heavy tears badges of either's woe

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: poor douglas before his death when it was in sight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't of course thank heaven stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a rage of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tail at a point after it had in a manner the gun
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he had for his own town residence of big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in essex that he wished her immediately to proceed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations m that his own affairs took a all his time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i don't anticipate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was young i tried nervous it was a vision of serious duties and little company for really great loneliness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes but that's just the beauty of her passion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was the beauty of it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: its sounded dull that sounded strange and all the more so because it his main condition which was
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that w for a moment disburden delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but was that all her rewards one of the ladies asked
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became everyday more brilliant and the intelligence that through its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonored bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yet these thoughts affected hester prynne less with hope than apprehension
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the child had a native grace which does not invariably coexist with thoughtless beauty its attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became at best
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this outwards mutability indicated and did not more than fairly expressed the various properties of her inner life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hester could only account for the child's character and even then most vaguely and imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily fram from its material of earth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hester prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that rolled the moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits but hester could not have questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human child
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has evoked the spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if spoken too she would not speak again
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as to pryin wet one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state bore though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only cause a fierce and bitter contests in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the frame work itself of the legislature
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have spoken of pearl's rich and luxuriant beauty of beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depths and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the mother herself as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: come therefore and let us spling m at them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but pearl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were lattice windows the wooden shutters to close over them that need
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester prynne gave a summons which was answered by one of the governor's bond servants a freeborn english man but now a seven year's slave
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yea his honourable worship is within but he hath a godly minister to with him and likewise a leech
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yee may not see his worship now
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fairest state in his native land
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on the table and token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind stood a large pewter tankard at the bottom of which had hester or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draught of ale
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gloaming armor as she had been with the glittering fronty piece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breast plate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mother cried she i see you here look look
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pearl accordingly ran to the bow windows at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this sid of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mister blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that half mythological personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a bull
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pearl seeing the rose bushes began to cry for our bed rose and would not be pacified
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he wore blue silk stockings gloomy pans with gold buckles a blue ruffled waist and a jacket and bright blue braided with gold
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his hat had a peaked crown in the flat brim and around the brim with a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: instead of shoes the old m war boots with turn over tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of oz in which they lived
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when they were outside on simply lapsed the door and started up the path
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the foot of the mountain separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the gil ikons the path divided
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unc and ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of doctor piped
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: uncocked at the door of the house and a chubby pleasant faced woman dressed all and blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have come from a fire lonely a place than this alone mere place
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and you must be o joi unlucky she added
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ojo had never eaten such a fine meal and all his life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we are traveling replied ojo and we stop at your house juster rest and refresh ourselves
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the woman seemed thoughtful
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and one end and stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with the blue flame and over the fire hung for headless in a row all bubbling and steaming at a great rate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moan i am pleased to say it is nearly done you see i am making it for my good wife margolotte who wants to u some of it for a purpose of her own
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you must know said margolotte when they were all seated together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave a way all the powder of life he first made to old mamy the witch who used to leave in the country of the villikins to the north it yere
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the first lot we tested on our glass hat which not only began to live but has lived ever since
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think the next glass cat and magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and they prove of some use to us
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm afraid i don't knowed much you about the land of us
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you see i've lived all my life without nunkie the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that is one reason your ojo the unlucky said the woman in sympathetic tone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think i must show you my patchwork girl said margolotte laughing at the boy's astonishment for she is rather difficult to explain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but first il tell you it for many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cox the meals and wash the dishes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yet that tasks was not so easy as you may suppose
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and collars of cloths all neatly so together
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when i found it i said to myself that it would do nicely for my certain girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the emerald city where are princess ozma lives green is the popular color
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ojo examined this curious contrivance with wonder
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: margolotte had first made the girl's form from the patchwork quilled and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same game material throughout
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her necking several neat braids
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: gold is the most common medal in the land of oz and is used for many purposes because it is soften pliable
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no i forgot on about in brains exclaimed the woman
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well that may be true agreed margolotte but on the contrary a servant with too much brains is sure to become independant and high and mighty and feel above her work
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in this servant
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she ran to her husband side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: their contents had all boiled away leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it altogether in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ojo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he selected a small gold bottle with a pepper box top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: most people talk too much so it is a relief to find one who talks too little
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am not allowed to perform magic except for my own amusement he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe where the cooking stem and began to smoke
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is it of os who used to be a humbug and knew no mat to at all has been taking lessons of glinda and i'm told he is getting to be a pretty good wizard but he is nearly the assistant of the great sorceress
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it truly is asserted the magician
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know use them as ornamental statuary in my garden
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: dear me one a chatter boxer getting to be sunk remarked the magician who was pleased with the compliment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: asked the voice in scornful accents
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince who indulge their passions and promoted their interest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the edith of milan the great charter of toleration had confirmed to each individual of the roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but this inestimable privilege was soon violated with the knowledge of truth the emperor imbibed the maxims of persecution and the sex which dissented from the catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumphs of christianity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: constantine easily believed that the heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts and diocletian and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felled the hend of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they asserted with confidence and almost of exultation that the apostolical succession was interrupted that all the bishops of europe and asia were effected by the cantation of guilt and schism and that the prerogatives of the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the african believers who alone had preserved in violet the integrity of their faith and discipline
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: bishops virgins and even spotless infants were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance before they could be admitted to the communion of the dom nist
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: proscribed by the civil ecclesiastical powers of the empire the donates still maintained in some provinces particularly ino media their superior numbers and four hundreds bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: since the period of our tale the active spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements though none but the hunter or the savages ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had dispersed the mists and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest when the travellers resumed their journey
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: after proceeding a few miles the progress of hawke who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he crossed a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinion of ching gutch group were frequent and earnest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yet here we within a short range of the scars and not a sign of a trail had we crossed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: let us retrace our steps and examine as we go with keener eyes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: g gutch book had caught the look and motioning with his hand he bade him speak
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumphs that the youth assumed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: see said uncas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone towards the forest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if a rock or rivulet or bit of earth harder th common severed the links of the clue they followed the true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: extinguished brands were lying around a springing the offals of a deer were scattered about the place and the trees bore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the examination however resulted in no discovery
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the whole party crowded to the spot where uncas pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist alluvium
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: run back uncas and bring me the size of the singer's foot
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: notwithstanding the high resolution of hawkeye he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in his return to the camps his acute and practised intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of balum's asked to speak he was somewhat sceptical on the subject of a bare singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was something in his air in the manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the ingenious hawke who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well known voice replied
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the truth began to dawn upon him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: come come returned haw uncas in his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion you may see a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the young man is in bondage and much i fear his death as decreed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i greatly mourned that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and i have sought a goodly him can you lead me to him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the tasks will not be difficult returned david hesitating though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate his unhappy fortunes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very centre of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas wary but close observers of the manner of their captive
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: delivered in a strong tone of assent announced the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an exhibition of weakness and an enemy so long hated and so much feared
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjuror to enter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the bear instead of o bane maintained the seat it had taken and growled
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the haint he received they must stand further off
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mucus occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful withes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and this singer as as good as nothing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the delawares our children of the tortoise and the outstripped the deer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: uncas who had already approached the door in readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but hawke who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself than to his companion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so unc you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well what can't be done by main courage and war must be done by circumvention
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little neet how that so direct and attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if you are not then knocked on the head your being an non composer will protects you and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: se choose for yourself to make a rush or terry here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: bravely and generously as he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it h becomes true warriors and trusty friends
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practice myself as one without across a blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: god bless you friend i do believe your sent has not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts in the force of temptation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the delaware dog he said leaning forward in peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features is he afraid
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will the hurons here his groans
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: tho he kin started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he had no occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: lucas cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrolled the agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: without his scrap books his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was absent neither more than an hour
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the only duplicate which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honest thees absolutely above suspicion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the moment i looked at my table i was aware that some one had rummaged among my papers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the etern of was that someone passing had observed the key in the doors had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in the chair will i made a most careful examination of the room
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a broken tip of lead was lying there also
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to the best of my belief they were rolled up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: didnt anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was in such a hurry to come to you you left you door open
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so it seems to me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now mister stones at your disposal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: above or three students one on each story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his neck crane he looked into the room
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is no opening except the one paining said o learned guide
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm afraid there are no signs here said he
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you left him in a chair you say which chair by the window there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the men entered and took the papers sheat by sheet from the central table
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as a matter of fact he could not said sums for i entered by the side door
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how along would it take him to do that using every possible contraction a quarter of an hour not less
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then he tossed it down and seized the next
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a vy harry to retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister song was was some overwhelmed by this flood of information
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: holmes held out a small ship with the letters and n and the space of clear wood after them you see
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what's and i have always done you and injustice there are others
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was hoping that if the paper which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface no i see nothing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as hm drew the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and in alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hm turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor helloa what is this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: holmes hated out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i understand you to say that there are three students who use this stare and are in the habit of passing your door yes there are
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and they are all in for the examination yes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: let us se the suspicions i will look after the proofs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my scholar has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the top floor belongs to mow as mc c laren
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i dare not go so far as that but of the three he has perhaps the least unlikely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by have occasionally done the same thing at other times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: did you look at these papers on the table
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how came you to leave the key and the door
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: anyone the room could get out yes sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i really don't think he knew much about at mister holmes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: only for a minute or so
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh i would not venture to say sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you haven't seen any of them no sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was the indian whose dark sila appeared suddenly upon his blind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no names please said holmes as we knocked to give her store
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of course he did not realize that it was i who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances runner suspicious
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that is very importance at homes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you don't seem to realize the position
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to morrow with the examination
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i cannot be allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings goodbye
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the found mouth fellow at the top
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he is the one with the worst record
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why banister a servant what's his game in the matter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he impressed me as being a perfectly honestest man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my friends did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no good my dear watson
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think so you have formed a conclusion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: look at that he held out his hand
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on the palm were three little pyramids of black d y clay
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and one more this morning
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the fact publick and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable of scholarship
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you know him i think so
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court marshal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no sir certainly not
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was no man sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon banister in the farther corner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: just close the door said homes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we want to know mister gil christ how you an honorable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for a moment gil crisis with upraised hand tried to control his writhing features
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: come come said holmes kindly it is human to air and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well ill don't trouble to answer listen and see that i do you know injustice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he could examine the papers in his own office
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the indian i also thought nothing of
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when i approached your room i examined the windows
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no one less than that would have a chance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i entered and i took you into my confidence as to this suggestions of the side table
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are weare with several sharps spikes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he put his shoes on the table
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: gloves said the young man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: have i told the truth mister gil grist
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i have a letter here mister sums which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of restless night
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it will be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if mister sam sawed the game was up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the debate between the senior societies her defense of the fifteenth amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the south she had not thought of of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not averse to charleston or new orleans
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: john taylor who had supported her through college was interested in cotton
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: better go he had counsel sententiously
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: might learn something useful down there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but john is no society just elementary work

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at any rate i say go
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused odors and bodily perspiration was to her times unbearable
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of grateful lanes and were forms
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so for the hundredth time she was thinking to day as she walked alone up the lan back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cotton she post
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she had almost forgotten that it was here within touch and sight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her stretching a whit to the northward
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there might be ad bit of port try here and there but most of this place was such desperate prose
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her re guards shifted to the green stalks and leaves again and she started to move away
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cotton is a wonderful thing is it not boys she said rather primly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: miss taylor did that know much about cotton but at least one more remarked seemed called for
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: don't know will of all things inwardly commented miss taylor literally boring and cotton and oh well as much as to ask what's the use she turned again to go

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the honourable charleses smithy miss sara's brother was walking swiftly up town from mister easterly le's wall steed office and his face was pale
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at last the cotton combine was to all appearances an assured facts and he was slated for the senate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why should he not be as other men

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: missus grey had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mind vividly their cruelty to poor negros a subjects she made her pointed introducing forthwith

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i believe in the training the people to the has capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but caswell added significantly c passit it differs enormous lay between races
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the band of pools were sure of this and the englishman instances india became quite eloquent missus gray was mystified but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversations seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest scrutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: os givee hick added crest well avoiding his sister's eyes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but we an niter exactly welcome
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mary tao however related the tale of z to missus grace proved ear later

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was so strange in human a creature
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the world was water veiled d mists
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then of a sudden that mid day the sun shot out hot and still no breath of air stirred the sky was like blue steel of the earth steam
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where was the use of imagining
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the lagoon had been level with the dids a week ago and now
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he splashed to stepped along farther and farther onwards until we neared the rampart of the clearing and puts foot upon the tree bridge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then he looked down the lagoon was dry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green fifth tall wet and willowy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the squares of cotton sharp edged heavy were just about to verse to bowls
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a one long moment he paused stupid a gape with utter amazement then leaned dizzily against the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he gazed about re flexed astonished
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work in pains someone had other could now from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by long and cooked way thus allowing it to empty directly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost sol
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the years of the days of her dying were ten
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: up in the sick rooms or lay on the little white bed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: been that and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumbs speechless terror against some mighty grasping that stove for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: full while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at sun in bird and tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she rose or the fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forwards wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she had been borne within its porters with his boer she had lived and grown and within its border she had met her love
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island lo the cotton lay before her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the chair was empty but he knew
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he darted through the trees and caus a tall man strongly but slimy made
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is a very fine old place of red brick softened by a peal powdery lichen which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with a limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables bu windes and the door place
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the windows are patched with wooden pans and the door i think is like the gate it is never opened
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shedding with a sonorous bang behind the liveried blacky who had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a large open fireplace with rusty dogs in it and a bearer boarded floor at the far end fleeces of wolves stacked up in the middle of the floor some empty corn bags
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and what through the left hand window
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: several clothes horses a pillion a spinning wheel and an old box wide opened and stuffed ful of colored rags
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the edge of this box there lies a great wooden doll which so far as mutilation is concern bears a strong resemblance to the finest greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the history of the house is plain now
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but there is always as stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beams and making sparkles amongst the wet straw and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cow shed and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow build ducks who are seizing the a opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it as possible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where the great barn doors are thrown wide open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendence of mister glebe the widow otherwise saddler who entertains them with a latest treadles toon gossip
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hetty sorrow often took the opportunity when her aunt's back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished services for the oak table was usually turned up like a screen and was more for ornament than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round pewter dishes there were ranged on the shelves above the long deal dinner table or in the hops of the grat which always shone like jasper
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do not suppose however that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish and her appearance she was a good looking woman not more than eight and thirty of fair complexion and sandy hair well shapen lightfooted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the family likeness between her and her knees dinna morris with a contrast between her keenness and dimness seraphic gentleness of expression might have served a petter as an excellent suggestion for a martha and mary
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a damsel came with a airs shot seemed to take up an unfinished lucia barrel organ takes up a tune precisely at the point where it had left off
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the widows and why consequently missus poyser should scold molly the housemaid with unusual severity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: dwell appearance mollie had got through her after it in her work in an exemplary manner had cleans herself with great dispatch and now came to ask submissively if she should sit down to her spinning till milking time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: spinning indeed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i never knew your equals for gallows ness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: who taught you to scrub up floor i should like to know
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: comb the wolf for the wood oss indeed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's what you'd like to be doing is it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's the way with you that's the road you'd all like to go head longs to ruin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister ale's indeed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you are a rare and p sitting down to your work a little while after its time to put by
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: money my irons trip told these put it down to warm
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cold is it my darling bless your sweet face
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she's going to put the ironing things away
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: money i did lie to do into the barn to tommy to see the wood od
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no no no totty a git her feet wet said missus poyser carrying away her ire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: did ever anybody see the like screamed missus poyser running towards the table when her i had fallen on the blue stream
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: totty however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run and in amount of fat on the neigh of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and she was very fond of you too aunt rachel
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when she had that man illness and i was only eleven years old she used to say you'll have a friend on earth in your aunt rachel if i'm taken from you for she has a kind heart and i'm sure i've found it so
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and there's linen in the house as i could well spare you for id got lots of sheeting and table clothing and towing as isn't made up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but not more than what's in the bible and said dinna
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nay dear aunt you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work and their families
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we can all be servants of god wherever our lot is cast but he gives us different sorts of work according as he fits us for it and calls us to it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can no more helps spending my life and trying to do what i can for the souls of others then you could help running if you heard little totty crying at the other end of the house the voice would go to your heart you would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i've strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my uncle in the children for anything i have done
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i didn't preach without direction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: direction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had a common patience with you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and had got down from their horses it was plain they meant to come in
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: said mister berwin this stately cordiality
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh sir don't mention it said missus poyser
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i delighting your kitchen
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: poyser is not at home missy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: said captain dy thorn sitting himself where he could sea along the short passage to the open dairy door
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no sir he isn't he's gone to rossiter to see mister west the factor about the wool
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but there's father an barn sir if he'd be of any use
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no thank you i'll just look at the whelps and leave a message about them with your shepherd
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i must come another day and see your husband i want to have a consultation with him about horses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for if is anywhere on a farm we can send for him in a minute
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh sir said missus poyser rather alarmed you wouldn't like it at all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but you know more about that than i do sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think i should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i knows harm is in better order than any other within ten miles of usin as for the kitchen he added smiling i don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by the bye i've never see your dairy i must see her daring missus poyser
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this missus poyser said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her milk pans and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh i've no doubt its in capital order
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the paris planned like that of the crystal palace was a temporary exhibit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: p london platt was less temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings and the vicinity of holborn b ada
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there mess hears johnson and hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the dynamo electric machine th small was robust for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the platt to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine seventeen years
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why if we erect station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there seems no good reason for believing that it will change
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: broad as the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them he is idiot and chronically opposed to loos and wasteful methods to plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: everything he is done has been aimed at the conservation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could it charge storage batteries all of which are easily within thea ability of the dire current
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered summer and a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a far mouse the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and is ideal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope test tube and galvanometer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governed and regulated than those available for his dynamo and lamp edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister addison was a leader far ahead of the time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake also regulator speed but waited for an indicated a verify it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running and mister disan in formed me that as him rene engine started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: edison had installed his historic first great central station system in new york on the multi arc system covered by his feeder and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a strait two wire system throughout of the tree kind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success none alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact districts of large cities
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the strong position held by the edison system under this strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate emphasis to incandescent lightning
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was specially suited for a trial platt also in the early days when a yield of six or eight lamps to the horse power was consider subject for congratulation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the street conductors were of the overhead whole line construction aver installed by the construction company that had been organized by addison to build an equip central stations
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three war system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent in banners at practically the same time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think he was perhaps more appreciative than i was of the discipline of the edison construction de pardon and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning the fourth before we started up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were later used as reserved machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of e asia but they remained i practically as good condition as one installed in eighteen eighty three
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the arc lamp and stalled outside a customers premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a metre
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was infinite scepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject bare thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed and only gave secondary evidence of itself that the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hence the edison electrolytic metre is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the principle employed in the edison electrolytic metre is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this standard edison neither practice was to remove the cells once a months to the metre room of the central station company for examination another sat being substituted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in december eighteen eighty eight mister w j jex read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter th more generally in use than any other
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the others having been in operation to short at time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison metre was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station some in current by metre
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the metre continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he weighed and rew todd the metre plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the problems was salted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we had mits in which there were two bottles of liquid
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: here she would stay comforted and soothe among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turner the gardener who since polly's first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamors demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then dear said missus whitney you must be kinder to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if she could only see phronsie for just one moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh she's always at the piano said van she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at this the bundle open suddenly and out popped phronsie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but polly couldn't speak and have jasper hadn't caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool phronsie and all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: asked phronsie with her little face close a polly's own
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now you'll stay cried van say polly won't you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh you are the dearest and best mister king i ever saw but how did you make mammy let her come
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: isn't he splendid cried jasper an intense pride swelling up father knew how to do it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there there he said soothingly patting her brown cy head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know gasped polly controlling her sobs i won't only i can't thank you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: asked phronsie in intense interests slipping down of polly's arms and crowding up close to jasper's side
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truly phronsie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh no chapter i must go by my very own self
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: bear jap you've caught it laughed percy while the others screamed at the side of jasper's face
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: don't mind it polly whispered jasper twasn't her fault
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: dear me ejaculated the old gentleman and the utmost amazement and such a time as i've had to get her here too
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how did her mother ever let her go
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she asked impulsively i didn't believe you could persuade her father
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i didn't have any fears if i worked it rightly said the old gentleman complacently
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he cried in high dudgeon just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose of them all to sooth his fancy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is sixteen years since john burgs and died
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his wife now lies beside him and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the norwegian brave yard one looks out over a vast checker board marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gaily painted farmhouses the gilded weather veins on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the heir and the earth there curiously mated and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's not much of a job for an athlete here i've been to town and back
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i sanger that he sleepily
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she gathered up her reins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: please wait for me marie a no coax
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i never see lose sighed over here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how brown you've got since you came home i wished i had a ay to mow my orchard
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i get wet to my knees when i go down to pick cherries
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: indeed he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they think your proud because you've been away to school or something
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual grimness and care for detail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on either side of the road for a mile before ye reached the foot of the hill stood tall o sage oran judges their glossy green mocking off the yellow fields
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: anyone thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra bergen
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is even a white throw of bee hives in the orchard under the walnut trees
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: frank red english slowly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he grew
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: marie's side
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that invitation decided her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh but i'm glad to get this place mowed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: just smell the wild roses they are always so spicy after a rein
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we never had so many of them in here before
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i suppose it's the wet season well you not to cut them to
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i suppose that's the whit dees and two of them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it exciting to see everything growing so fast and to get the grass cut
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: aren't you splashed look at the spider rips all over the grass
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in a few moments he heard the cherry's dropping smartly into the pail and he began to swing his sigh with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learn
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: lari picked cherries and saying softly to herself stripping one glittering ranch after another shivering when she taught a shower of raindrops on her neck and hair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and am heel mode his way slowly down towards the jerry trees
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that summer the reins had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than chivato and his man could do to keep up with the corn the orchard was a neglected wilderness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i don't know all of them but i know vans are
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if i feel that way i feel that way
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit long ivory colored berries tipped with main pink like white coral that fall to the brown unheeded all summer through
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he dropped a handful into her lap
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes don't you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh aver so madge only you seems kind of sta at and school teacher
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when she used to tell me about him i always wondered whether she wasn't a little l love with him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it would serve you all right if she walked off with karl
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i like to talk to car about new york and what a fellow can do there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh am ile
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: surely you are not thinking of going off there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: marie's face fell under his brooding gaze
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm sure i it sunder hopes you will stay on here she murmured
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i don't not to stand around to look gone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i want to be doing some ming on my own account
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sometimes i don't want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the four corners of the divide together he threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerk so like a tablecloth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i get tired of seeing man and horses going up and down up and down
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wish you weren't so restless and didn't get so worked up over things she said sadly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thank you he returned shortly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and you never used to be crossed to me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can't play with what you like a little boy any more he said slowly that's what you miss marie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but am nil if i understand then are good times are over we can never do nice things together any more
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and any how there's nothing to understand
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that at at last it will go away and things will be just as they used too
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i pray for you but that's not the same as if you prayed yourself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can't pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i won't pray not to have them not if i'm damned for it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: than all our good dimes are over
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: saturday august fifteen the sea unbroken all round no land in sight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the horizon seems extremely distant
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am will his nature has resumed its sway
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye aus
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one might be with less reason than now
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am not to plain that the rate is slow but that the seat is so wide
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where is in time and the fact is i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he called the sea paon and i long the wage ticking a little sail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i take this is my answer and i leave the professor tobit his lips with impatience
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sunday august sixteenth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nothing knew whether unchanged the wind freshens
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but there seem no reason of fear
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the shadow of the raft was clearly outline upon the surface of the waves
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: truly the sea is of infinite width
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it must be as wide as the mediterranean or the atlantic and why n
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: these thoughts agitated me all day and my imagination scarcely calm down after several hours sleeve
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i shudder as i recall these monsters to my remembrance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i saw at the hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i supposed professor liedenbrock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pick his eyes travers the ocean from side to side
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: tuesday august eighteenth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: during his watch i slept
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the raft was heat up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there's a whale a whale cried the professor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they whirled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of expressed trains
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: two monsters only re creating all this commotion and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can distinguish the eye of i thesaurus glowing like a red hot co and as large as a man's head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: its jaws is enormous and according the naturalists it is armed with no less than t hundredth and eighty two teeth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: those huge creatures attack each other with the greatest animosity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: suddenly the ii purus and the plus source disappear below leaving a war pool eddying in the water
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as for the if thesaurus has he returned to his submarine cavern
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wins become lost in the distance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the weather if we may use the term will change before law
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the atmosphere is charged with vapors pervaded with electricity generated by the evaporation of sailing waters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the electric light can scarcely penetrate through the dense curtain which is dropped over the theater on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the air is heavy the sea is calm
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from time to time a fleecy tuft of miss would yet some gleaming light left upon it drop down upon the dense form grey and loses itself in the o pig and impenetrable mass
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the atmosphere as evidently charged and surcharged with electricity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wind never lulls but to acquire increased strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there's a heavy storm coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on the mast already i see the light play of lament as saint arab's fire the outstrip sail catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but if we have now ceased to advance why do weet leave that sail loose which at the first shock of a tempest may capsize us in a moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that will be the safest no no never
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the piled up vapours contents into water and the air put in a violent action to supply the back him left by the condensation of the mist rouses itself into a world w
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: harm stirs night
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the under surface of the clouds there are continual missions of lurid light electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules the gaseous elements of the air need to be slaked with moisture for innumerable columns of water rushed upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i referred to the thermometer it indicates the figure is obliterated
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: is the atmosphere conditioning having once reached osten city to become final
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the raft bears on still to the south east
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at noon the volts of the storm re doubles
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: each of us is lashed as some part of the raft
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the waves rise above our heads
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they seem to be we are lost but i am not sure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he nods his consent
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the far ball half of it wide half a zu blue and the size and the ten inch show moved sol it about the rafts but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: here it comes there it glides now it up the ragged stump of the mast thats it lightly leaps on the provisioned bag descends with a light bound and just skim the powder magazine horrible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches hans who fixes his blue eye upon it steadily it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a suffocating smell of nitre fills the air it enters the throat it fills the lungs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we suffer stifling pains
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and how od the directions will look
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: poor alice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed the pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came o the duchess the duchess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh won't she'd be savage if i'd kept her waiting
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: alice took up up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is today
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and yesterday thinks went on just as usual
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i mer if i've been changed in the night
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i almost take i can remember feeling a little different
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'll try if i know' all the things i used to know
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i shall never get d twenty at that rate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no i've made up my mind about it if i mabel i'll stay down here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it'll be no use they're putting their heads down and saying come up again dear
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm so very tired to being all alone here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and i declare it's too bad that it is
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wish i hadn't cried so much said alice as she swim about trying to find her way out
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that will be a queer thing to be sure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am very tired a swimming about here oh mouse
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we won't talk about her any more if he'd rather not we indeed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the condition is that i will be permitted to make lo or talk american stream mine him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther un must we make him talk as he would talk to day to americans
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: let us begin with that his commentary undulations
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was written in latin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the word had to be condensed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a word should now be said about the origin of luther's commentary and relations
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: much later when a friend of his was preparing an addition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my delians for instance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther addressed to his students and the course of gallian and roar prepared the manuscript for the printer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it presents like no other of luther's writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christ's merits alone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the essence of luther's lectures is there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us power to serve and to do loop to
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the word of our god shall stand forever
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in every way they sought to under mony authority of saint paul
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they said to the relations you have no right to think highly of paul
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was the last to turn the christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: paw him later and his beneath us
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: indeed he persecuted the church of price for a long time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do you suppose that god for the sake of a few lutheran heretics would dis son his entire church
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: against these boasting false apostles paul boldly defends his apostolic authority in ministry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as the ambassador of a government is honoured for his office and not fir his private person so the minister of christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: paul takes pride in his ministry not to his own phrase but to the praise of god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: paul and apostle not of men et cetera
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yet doon het calls ministers tow the agency of men or he cussed them directly as he called the prophets in apostles
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: paul declares that the false apostles were called their sent neither by men nor by man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the most they could claim as that they were sent by others
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he mentions the apostle's first because they were a pointed directed by god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the call was not to be taken lightly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for a person of possess knowledge is not enough
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his spoils one's best work
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his call
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught so a string instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this is no sinful pride it is wholly pride
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in god the father who raised him from the dead
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the classing superfluous on first sight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: these perverts of the rightness of christ resists the father and the son and the works of them both
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this whole epistle pall treats of the resurrection of christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by his resurrection christ won victory over law sin flesh world devil death hell and every evil
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: first two
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and all the brethren which are with me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this should go far in shutting the mouths of the false of pauses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: although the brethren with me are not apostles like myself yet there all of one mind with me think right and teach as i do
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominate they go with the cushions are
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why d do they not invade the cat of provinces and preached their doctrine to godless princes bishops and doctors as we have done by the help of god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we look for that rewards which i hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not all the glens had become perverted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: these means cannot be contaminate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they remained divine regardless of men's opinion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church even though antichrist reigns there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the apostle verst three
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: grace be to you in peace from god the father and from our lords jesus christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the terms of grace and peace are common terms with pole and are now pretty well understood
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the greeting of the apostle was refreshing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: grace and balls the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the world brands this a pernicious doctrine
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: experience proves
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: however the grace and peace of god will
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: men should not speculate about the nature of god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: was it not enough to say from god the father
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to do so as to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure into comprehend his infinite majesty
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he came down to earth lived amongst men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: embrace him and forget about the nature of god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: did not christ himself say i am the way and the truth in the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when you are you about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we are to hear christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the same time paul confirms are creed that christ is very god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that christ is very god is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to this spence grace and peace
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to bestow peace and grace lies in the province of god who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and peace from our lord jesus christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the allans took cries for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mohammed also speedily of christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: paul six to esteem
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not gold or silver or pascal lambs or an angel but himself what for
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not for a crown or a kingdom or our goodness before sins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: under score these words for there are full of comfort for sore consciences
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how may we obtain remission of our sins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pauli incas the man who is named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our since
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be putt away by own efforts
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this sentence also defines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the greatness of the ransom christ son of god indicates this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will we are careless you make light of sin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we think that by some little work or merit we can dismissing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this passage then bears out defect that all man are solan or sin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin as a small matter easily take them care of by good works but we must present oursel on to god with good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this attitude is universal in particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on the other hand we are not to regard them is so terrible that we must despair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he passes abruptly from persons the ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to men from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subject and object first and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the influence which dene as has exercised upon b stit is due partly to a misunderstanding
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this supposed depths of this dial of the neal platonists found hidden meanings in connections with the jewish and christian pictures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly corrector in him his effort to realized in connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there isle danger of the modern cats owe at tires falling unto the absurdities of the deal plat mists
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the fancies of the meal plannin are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian ea and is not wholly extinct in our own bay
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spent they are opposed to him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we do not knowed how plate to would have arranged his own dialogs or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the teal which he has expressly connected was ever present in his mind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but he has not as yet be find this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felted that there was as great and impiety in winking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with her aquatic he acknowledges the perpetual flux like ane sagas he reserves the predominance of mine although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pianers he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: many if not all the element of the pis socratic philosophy are included in the time is
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the style and plan of the tus differ greatly from that of any other of the plutonic dials
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but plato has not the same messy over his instrument which he exhibits to the features or s impose him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nothing can exceed the beauty or are toting production in which his using words after his accustomed manner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he could writ in one style but not in another the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the tens of plato which characterizes the philosophical born of lucretius
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is a want of flow and often a defect of ribbon the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of that position and more of repetition than occurs in plato's earlier writings
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: socrates begins the tene with a summary of the republic
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and now his desires to see the ideal state set in motion who would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and therefore to you i turn to me as citizen of laws who at once a philosopher and a statesmen and to you courteous whom all athenians know to be similarly accomplished and to hermocrates who is also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i will et mee as it proves i a prove
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: listen then socrates to a tale of solace who being the friend of troves like great grandfather tot it to my grandfather courteous and he told me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some poems of solemn were recited by the boys
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and what was the subject of the poet said the person will made the remark
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the subject was a very noble one he described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever engaged
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the memory of their exploits have passed away owing to the lapse of time and the extinction of the actors
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: tell us said the other the whole story and wears solemn het the story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us magistrate forever in our temples
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the genealogies which will have recited sh us out of your own ann all solemn are a mere children's story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for in the times before the great flood athens was the greatest and best of cities and did the noblest deeds and had the best constitution of any under the face of heaven
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: solemn marvelled and desire to be informed of the particulars
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nine thousand years have elapsed since she found it yours and eight thousand since she found it ours as are anna to record
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: many laws exist among this which are the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i will briefly describe him to you and it shall read the accounts of them as your leisure in the sacred ragists
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: observe again what heere the law tuke in the pursuit of wisdom searching out the deep things of the world and applying them to the use of men
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the most fame as of them mal was the overthrow of the island of a plantes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for at the peril of her own existence and when the other healing had deserted her she repelled invader and off her own ac quart gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this is the explanations of the shallows which are found in that part of the atlantic ocean
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but i would not speak at the time because i wanted to refresh my memory
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first genus who is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of men and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost athenian citizens of whom the egyptian records spoke
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but already at pointed economic evolution far and dating the emergence of the lady specialized consumption of a goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had began to work out in a mor oral less elaborate system
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a davit of growth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: such consumption as false to the women is nearly incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labour and not the consumption directed to their own comfort and fullness of life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with the further advance and counter this tibi change into simple custom of a mor or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it beat bu or large to conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: under the tabu certain victuals and m pic clearly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free yews of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific as being a mark at the seconds remove of the superior states of those who are able to afford the indulgence
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into every days speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with many qualifications if more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradual a weakened the general rue is fell to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the objection of cause presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious fence of senile
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these knives are also present in the later development that they do not continue to be the sold motives
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is a moralist elevate system of rank and grates
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this differentiation is further by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are the same time less men of substance in their own right so that some of them m scarce let all others only partly to be rated as vicarious consumers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: se many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as thy curious consumer without qualification
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: many of these again and also many of the other our cuc cy of lest degree having turn attached to their persons are more or less comprehensive group of vicarious consumer in the persons of their wives and children their servants retainers et cetera
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wearing of uniforms a liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wearers of uniforms of liveries may be rest or divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that the general distinction is not a m account to be overlooked
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so those offices which are by wright the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accouterments and like in short those which may be class as ostensibly predatory employments
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: whenever as in these cases the menial services in question has to d directly with a prime re leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a effected honorific character
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the livery becomes obnoxious to meany all who are required to wear it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in a general way though not wholly in all consistently these two groups coin sight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in related development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarily performed gradual in narrows the wife remains the last
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of by carest leasure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the communities of the western culture this point is a present found among the lower middle class
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if future comfort is achieved and it is a moralist for true is circumstance af fair they must be achieved by means and methods that command themselves tor the great economic law of v wasted effort
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the man of the household also can do something in this diction and indeedy commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums the man and presently also the children virtue ceased to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the soule exponent of the household's pecuniary decency
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: very much of squalor and discomfort will be endued before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decencies put away
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is no class and no country that as yielded sole abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the question is which of the two methods will most effectively reachd the persons whose convictions it is desired to effect
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: each will there for serve about equal well during the earner stages of social growth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of high thing the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is also noticeable that the serves ability consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is that its bress in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individually widest and the nobility of the populations greatest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: consumption becomes a large a element in the standard of living in the city on in the country
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: among the country population its places to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighbour gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the result is a great p ability of the labor employed in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well define and considerable body of workmen
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising which should expect a fine leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary elation pretty evenly between them at the outset
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came to the rank firma above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the course i peaceful culture
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: are the circumstance permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and al what devi of humans
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: o reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by resort to make believe men in intricate polite ob servants and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations s found with some specious object of amelioration em boded in their official stolen title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the talk is may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffick
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the sailing features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: throughout the entire revolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or or services or human life runs the obvious invocation that in order to effectually men the consume is good thing it must be expenditure of superfluities
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as use in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends salt by the consumer under this cannon of constituent waste
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterise this wasteful
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: an artic lady useful and wasteful both and it utility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and often has my mother said while on her lap i laid my head she feared for time i was not made but for eternity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why are we to be denied each others society
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why are we to be divided
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: surely it must be because we're in danger of loving each other too well of losing sight of the creator in idolatry of the creature
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we used to dispute about politics and religion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she notorious clergyman's daughter was always in a minority of one in our house of violent descent and radicalism
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her feeble health gave her her yielding manner for she could never oppose anyone without gathering up all her strength for the struggle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he spoke french perfectly i have been told when need was but delighted usually in talking the broadest yorkshire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent radicals and dissenters into which twenty years ago of a little quiet resolute clergyman's daughter was received and by whom she was truly loved an honored
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: january in february of eighteen thirty seven had passed away and still there was no reply from sey
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am not depreciating it when i say that in these times it is not rare
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you can sil your own happiness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will say that a woman has no need of such a caution there can be no peril in it for her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the more she is engaged in her proper duties the last leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to those duties you have not yet been called and when you are you will be less eager for celebrity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but do not suppose that i despair to the gifts which you possess nor that i would disc you from exercising it i only exhort you so to think of it and so to use it as to render it conduce it to your own permanent good
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: farewell madame
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: though i may be but an ungracious adviser you will allow me therefore to describe myself with the bestest wishes for your happiness here and hereafter your two friend wal bert sylvie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sir march sixteenth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i have not ventured to hope for such a reply so considerate in its tone so noble in its spirit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know the first let i wrote to you was all sense this trash from beginning to end but i am not altogether the idle dreaming being it would seem to denote

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there befell an anxious interview mistress f seth aging for and against the squire's project in the breath
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: most of all robin thought of his father what would he counsel

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: never's sir he had said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was in deep converse with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arm
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now to bed boys

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: dismiss your squire robin and bid me goody in
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as any in england i would say said came well proudly that is in his day
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to game well's chamber
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will cried he softly and steppy who had chosen his couch across the door of his young master's chamber sprang up at once at answer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we will go out together to the bower there is a way down to the court from my windows
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: rest and be still until i warn you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hours pasted wearily by and move it could yet be heard about the hall
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at last all was quiet and blacken the courtyard of game well
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will whispered robin opening his doors he spoke are you ready
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they then renewed their journey and under the better light made a safe crossing of the stable roofs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: robin entered the hut dragging the unwilling esquire after him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: be not so foolish friend said f sooth costly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they moved thereafter cautiously about the hut groping before and about them to find something to show that the warrington had fulfilled his mission
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and steadily had tripped over the edge of the reversed flap mouth of this pit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fitzooth's hand rested at last upon the top run of a later and slowly the truth came to him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: robin carefully descended the latter and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: stoutly was by his side in the flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and character of this vault
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice warrant ands
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: save me masters but you startled me rarely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cried he waving the lantern before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: inquired robin with his suspicions still upon him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: truly such a horse would be worth much in notting him fair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nay day lording answered warrenton with a half laugh
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: warrenton spoke thus with significance to show robin that he was not to think jeffreys claims to the estate would be passed by
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: robin fitzooth saw that his doubts of warren and had been unfair and he became ashamed of himself for harbouring them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his tones ran pleasantly on warrenton's ears and forthwith the good fellowship was heralded between them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to game well that this passageway led from the hut and in a pleasance to sherwood and that jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he implores us to be discreet as the grave and this matter for in soothe his life is in the hollow of ours hands
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they regain their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gamewell
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: out in the wood stood a nice little fir tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the place he had was a very good one the sun shone on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as furs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he did not think of the warms sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cotta childrens that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but this was what the tree could not bear to hear
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hair would offen come leaping along and jumped right over the little tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: o that made him so angry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to grow and grow to get older and be t thought the tree that after all is the most de light full thing in the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in autumn the woodcutters always came and felled some of the largest trees
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this happened every year and the young fir tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and bare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were laden carts and the horses dragged of them out of the wood
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: have you not met them anyway
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: rejoys and thy growth said the sunbeams
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and then what happens then
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: were i but already on the cart
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where i in the warn room with all the splendor and magnificence
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes and something better something still pender will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ornament me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: something better something still grander must follow but what
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what choice in ours presence said the air and the sunlight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: rejoice in my own fresh youth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter in summer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the axe struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pangs like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful that being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the departure was not at all agreeable
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the tri only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendent we wot want the others
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there two were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture books and full of toys were hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the children said so
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this evening they all said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how it will shine mis evening
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: perhaps the other trees from the forests will come to look at me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it blazed up famously help help
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cried the young ladies and they quickly puts out the fire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but i shall tell only one story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: humpy don't be fell downstairs and yet he married good princess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's the way of the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thought the fir tree and believed at all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i won't tremble to morrow thought the fir tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the morning a servant and the housemaid came in
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what's the meaning of this thought the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to putt some great trunks in the corner out of the way
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: tis now winter out of doors thought the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how kind man is after all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if it only were not so dark here and so terribly lowly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sleek squeak
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they snuffed about the fir tree and rustled amongst the branches
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am by no means old said the fir tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there's many a one considerably older than i am
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were so extremely curious
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know know such place said the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the light before and they listened and said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: said the fir tree thinking over what he had himself related
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes in reality those more happy times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: who is hy d'y asked the nice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: only that one answered the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is a very s stupid story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no juno one about bacon and tallow candles cans you tell any later stories
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no said the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then good by said the rats and they went home
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listened to what i told them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now that two is over
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why one morning there came a quantity of people and said to work in the loft
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but it was not the fir tree that they meant
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the court yards some of the married children were playing who had danced at christmas round the thir tree and were so glad at the sight of him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the garden's boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wood flam up splendidly under the large brewing copper and its side so deeply
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: good if them beth refrained from dulling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogers visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned who closely about the penalty for fort in a cheque
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and tom gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in the states prison as a consequence of this rash act
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a dance he head in that light said the old boy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protected girl he loved
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but they could not have proven a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably a mere bluff
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was soft hearted in impetuous said beth and being in love he didn't stop to count the cost
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if the prosecution wor it withdrawn and they case settled with the victim of the fort check then the young man would be allowed his freedom
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but under the circumstances i doubt of such an arrangement could be made
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fair view was twelve miles away but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county trail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were received in the little office by a man ne markham who was the jailer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we wish to talk with him answered kenneth talk
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm writing for representative on the republican ticket said kenneth quietly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'll say that's different observed market altering his demeanor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: may we see gates at once asked kenneth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they followed the jailer along the succession of passages
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sometimes i'm that yearning for a smoke am merely crazy and ion know w his horse died one way or th other
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he unlocked the door and called here's visitors tom
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: horse tom horse error replied the jailer clue lily
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister graf said kenneth noticing the boy's face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sorr we have an any reception room in the jail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: s town please said gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice there's a pentuer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a fresh wholesome looking boy was tom gates was steady gray eyes and intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have heard something of your story said kenneth and are interested in it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and i'm glad i did it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: old well is a fine fellow but poor and helpless since missus rogers had her accident
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then rudders wouldn't do anything but lead her around and wait upon her and the place went to rack and ruin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he spoke simply but paced up and down to narrow cell in tam of them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: whose name det you signed to the check asked kenneth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it's a stock company in rich
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was bit keeper so it was easy to get a blink check and for the signature
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved him a heavy loss one day
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i discovered and put out of fire that would have destroyed the whole platte but marshal never even thanked me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm going to see mister mercia said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thank you sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it won't be much but un grateful have fin a friend
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they left him then for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i see what's at that kinds in my day
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and it ruins of ann's disposition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he looked up rather on gracious wee but motioned them to be seated
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some girls been in here twice to interview my men and i have refused to admit her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm not electioneering just now
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh well sir what about him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and he deserves a term in states prison
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'll pay all the cause beside
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: your foolish why should you do all this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i have my own reasons mister merci
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: give me a check for e under in fifty and al turn over to you the fort check and clash further proceedings
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he detested the grasping disposes him that would endeavour to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: beth une asiatic silence nudged him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he might have had that fort check for the face of it if he'd been sharp
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so to the surprise of the democratic committee m all his friends mister hopton hiss announced that he would oppose forts aggressive canting with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one of mister hopton him's first tasks after calling his faithful henchman around him was to make a careful canvas of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the weak need contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from opposition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the democratic committee figured out away to do this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: under ordinary conditions reynolds was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elle hopkins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the only thing necessary was too fix seth reynolds and this hopkins's arranged personally
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and this was why kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the younger woman in the budgy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the description she gave of the coming reception to the women's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice with the occupant of the other vehicle were
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist an electing mister forbes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the fairview band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given at elmhurst and the only when within the memory of man where the neighbours and country people had been the invited guess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the attendants was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted fore seeing great success for their fight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we ought to have more attendance beth said louise approaching her cousin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: won't you run into the house and see if martha camp spare one or two more mates
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was very fond of the young lady's whom she had known when a of jane was their mistress here and beth was her a special favourite
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the housekeeper led the way in bath followed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for a moment best stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and of slight smile upon her beautiful face
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was trusted in the regulation costume of the maids at elmhurst a plane black gown with a white apron and cap
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that she gave a little lu and replied no miss beth e elizabeth parsons
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but it can't be protested the girl
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i attend in a household bending you know and care for the linen
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you speak like an educated person said beth wonderingly where iss your home
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for the first time the maid seemed a little confused and re gaze wandered from the face of her visitor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rock slowly backing forth i'm sorry said beth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: eliza pars m shook her head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they they excite me in some way and i i can't bear them you must excuse me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: breath was a beautiful girl the handsomest of the three cousins by far yet eliza surpassed her a natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her manner was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well bred composure and calm reliance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her eyes wander to the maid's hands
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: however her features and for might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she rose quickly to her her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wish i knew myself she cried fiercely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will you leave the alone in my own room or must i go away to escape you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: eliza closed the door behind her with a decided swam and the key clicked in the lock
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: common cord returned its place amidst the tents
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: helish forwarded to the french baskets of flowers of which they had made a plentiful provision to gree be arrivals of the young princess the french in return invited the english to a supper which was to be given the next day
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he gratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the respect pain her on all sides she seemed like a queen and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three she appeared in object of worship the queen mother gained the french the most affectionate reception france was her native country and she had suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget france
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she taught her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had bold been hospitably received and where a brilliant future open for them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the count had thrown himself back on his sea leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus his face buried in his hands with heaving chest and restless limbs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this has indeed been a harassing day continued the young man his eyes fixed upon his friend
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will be frank with me our ow renee
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: can your imagine my buckingham has been so violent i suspect
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is you were m beacon row i have read his distressing his eyes in his every gesture and action the whole day
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can perceive love clearly enough
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am complains of what i say said the count
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is annoyance then
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in those very terms i even a more
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but continued row not interrupted by this movement of his friend heaven be praised the french who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet reckless e are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to mar own matters of such high importance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thus it is that the honor of thracian saint our country our masters and our own
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes i need repose many things have agitated me today both in mind and body when you return to morrows i shall no longer be the same man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by in this friendly pressure row could detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the night was clear starlit and splendid the tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life peace and security everywhere
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: upon the large square in front of the hotel the shadows of the tents intersected by the golden moonbeams formed as it were a huge mosaic of jet and yellow flagstones
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: bridle on washed for some time the conduct up the two lovers listened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of man a kemp who snored as imperiously as though he was wearing his blue and gold instead his violet suit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the liath makes another discovery
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were sett lily now near the solution of their problem
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the poor little things cried spa think of them having been turned to the wall all these years
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now what is the sense of it two less if babies like that
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but joyce had not been listening all at once she puts on her candle on the table and faced her companion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the twin brother did something she didn't like and she turned his picture to the wall
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hers happened to be on the same frame too but she evidently dint care about it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now what have you to say sin this bog
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i thought we were stumped again when i first sawed that picture but it of some use after all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do you suppose the mature was a copy of the same thing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one of the world does it query choice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were any terribly am besides i'n like to see what this lovely furniture looks like without such quantities of dust all over it did its scheme sin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will come and hit this afternoon with old clothes on and half a regular house clinging
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it can't hurt anything i'm sure for we won't disturb things at all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this thought however did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: smuggling the house cleaning paraphernalia into the cellar window unobserved that afternoon proved no easy task for scythia had added a wist broom and dust pan to the outfit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the lure proved too much for him and he came sporting after asked briskly as a young kitten much to sym ass delight when she caught sight of him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh let him come along she urged i be love to see him about bed old house
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he makes it sort of coz heer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: blots does the furniture and pictures
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yet little as it was it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: surface dust at least had been a re raved and the fine old furniture gave a hints of its real elegance c polish
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then she suddenly remarked
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and my pockets money is key low again and you haven't any left as usual
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they say illumination by candlelight is the prettiest in the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why's goliath that as usual be both cried peering in
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: is that he the greatest r begin to odd corners
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: forgetting all their wearin us they seized their candles and sturt though the house finding on occasional paper tucked away in some odd corner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well and convinced that the boarded up house mystery happened not earlier than april sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probably not much later
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no words were spoken no language was uttered say down of wailing in hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and law in reality
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i heard a noise behind i turned and saw kaffer his blacks eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted above his head as if to strike but i had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on worry said a distant voice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no sound broke the stillness of the light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition i wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what was that
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what then a human hand large and shapely appear distinctly the surface of the point
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nothing more not even the wrist to w it might be attached
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it did not beckon or indeed move at all it was as still as the hand of death
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i awoke to consciousness fighting at first it seen as if i was fighting with the phantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was kaffer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a sound of voices a flash of light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a feeling of freedom and i was awake where
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: said another voice which d recognize that ful chuse kaffer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had scarcely known what i had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke i looked at my hand
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the light of the moon i saw a knife red with blood and my hand too was also discoloured
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i do not know i am dazed bewildered
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but that is caffs life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know he had at this very evening
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: o robert saying have weve been together
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: o chair picked up something from the ground and looked at it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i say you do know what this means and you must tell us
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a terrible thought flashed into my mind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had again been acting under the influence of this man's power
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: perchance too kat's death might serve him in good stead
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my tone refused articulate my power of speech left me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my position was too terrible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my over wou nerves yielded at last
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for some time after that i remembered nothing distinctly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the three modes of management
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to suppose that the object of this works is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i reason and affection
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as the chase drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the doorstep her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexation and ill humour surge and swell among those delegate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps an irreparable injury
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the mother as soon as the chase is so far turned that mary can no longer watch the expression of her confidence goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfaction on her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the mother i managing the case in this way realized partly unconvincing their reason of the child and partly on an appealed to her affection
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if you should not be a good girl but should show sides of making as any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reasons and securing their affection cannot be overrated
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: della had a young sister nam cara and a cousin whose name was jain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to give an idea of these conversations i will report one of them in full
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you have come and sheelah and bela was the name of jam doll to make rosalie a visit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am very glad
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i expect you have been a very good girl and della since you were here last
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has sheep in a good girl jane
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for instance one day the children had been plain upon the piazza with blocks and other play thanks and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were now plain with their dolls in the parlor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: delia came to the parlor and with an air of great mystery be caned the children aside then said to them in a whisper leave and della and rosalie here and don't say a word them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the room and round by a circus root to the piazza there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: said she pointing to the playthings see
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: put these play things all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know anything about you leaving them out
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nature of the effect produced by early impressions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that is comparatively nothing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we not going to any such extreme as this we can easily see on reflection how vast in influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action immature years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impress upon the mind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but ands cared nothing about that
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he made about so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dum founded i can telled you when he saw it was nobody but ands
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now this knife was a splendid one though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked an end's knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes why not thought ands
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: seeing that i am so fine i may as well go and vis it the king
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am going to the court ball answer ands
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and she took and her hand and wal with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every thirds step and through the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing where ever he went
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for like as not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the father end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wines sparkled in glittering decanters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the princess set down under a blue canopy with bouquets a roses and she let and her sit in a golden chair by her side
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to they git off
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he only shook his head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that is a very fine cap you have he said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so it is said ands
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and it is made of mother's best yarn and she knitted it herself and everybody wants to get it away from me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with one jump ands got out of his chair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he darted lake an arrow through all the halls down all the stairs and across the yards
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he still held onto it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cat for a king's golden crown he said that ands was a stupid
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and her's face grew red
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but his mutter hug them close
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no my little son she said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five o'clock the king entered his cabinet where his tailors or awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ah very well
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: let him come in then said the king and as if colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself o currant with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two courtiers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: gentleman dear posts whereupon saint annon and villeroi took their leave
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: certainly sire but i must have money to do that what
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what does you mean inquired louise
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he has given them with too much grace not to have utters still to give if they are required which as the case at the present moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: does your majesty then no longer believe the disloyal attent
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not at all you are on the contrary most agreeable to me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: your majesty's planned then in this affair is
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will take them from my private treasure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the news circulated with the rapidity of lightning during its progress it kindled every variety coquetry desire and wild ambition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the king had completed his toilet by nine o'clock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dais or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theatre of wonderful elegance of construction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: suddenly for the purpose of restoring piece in order spring accompanied by his whole court made his appearance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the seasons allies of spring followed him closely to form a quad real which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of vance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage in flesh colored silken hose a silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seemed to sore along
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes it is suppressed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: far from its sire your majesty having given no directions about it the musicians e retained it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes sire and ready dressed with the vall
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sire he said your majesty's most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasioned with similar zeal that he is already shown on the field of battle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the king seemed only pleased with everyone present
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the ballet began the effect was more than beautiful
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutored pantomime of that period only the more natural on accounts of the vari indifferent acting of the august actors had reached its culminating point of triumph the theatre shook with tumultuous applause
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgment he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the market preference of the princess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupefied
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the king who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille cast a look upon his vanquished rival
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: everyone could observe his agitation and prostration a prostration which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and his eyes with all their bright intelligence be dimmed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: upon this madame deigned turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte observing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do you think so she replied with indifference
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: explain yourself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i allude to the goddess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the princess enquired no
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theatre but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love is thus strangely constituted he found that impossible even to remain much longer separated from their presence of one who had broken his heart
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: remaining i implore you the evening is most lovely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in dad up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i remember now and i congratulate myself do you love anyone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: forgive me i hardly know what i am saying a thousand times forgive me madame was right quite right this brutal exile has completely turned my brain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there cannot be a doubt he received you kindly for in fact you returned without his permission
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: o mademoiselle why have i not a devoted sister or a true friend such as yourself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what already hear they said to her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i have been here this quarter of an hour replied levi
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: did not the dancing amuse you no
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no more than the dancing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: laval is quite a poetic said tony chant
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am a woman and there are few like me whoever loves me flatters me whoever flatters me pleases me and whoever pleases well said montalais you do not finish
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is too difficult replied mademoiselle det ani shan laughing loudly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: lucky yonder do you not see the moon slowly rising silvering the topmost branches of the chestnuts and the yolks
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: exquisite soft turf of the woods the happiness which their friendship confers upon me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well said mademoiselle detur i shall on i also think a good deal but i take care
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to say nothing said montalais so that wen mademoiselle det nis cher thanks at thee is the only one who knows it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: quick quick then among the high reed grass said montalais stoop bethany you are so tall
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the young girls had indeed made themself small indeed invisible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was here just now said the count
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you are positive then
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes that perhaps i frightened her in what way
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how is it laval said mademoiselle denis chant that the vicomte de brag alone spoke of you as louise
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it seems the king will not consent to it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: good gracious as the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i give my consent
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh i am speaking seriously replied montalais and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the kings i suppose is it not louise
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: let us run then set all three and gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thickest cupboard of the park
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in fact the sound of madam's and the queen's carriages could be heard in the distance upon the hard dry ground of the roads followed by the mountain cavaliers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this way the fed of the whole court was a fet also for the mysterious inhabitants of the forest for certainly the deer in the brake the pheasant on the branch the fox in its hole were all listening
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: all about him was a tumult of bright and broken color scattered and broad splashes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the merganser had a crested head of ear descent green black a broad collar of lustrous white black back black and white wings white belly sides finely penciled in blacken white and of breast of rich chestnut red streaked with black
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his feet were red his long narrow beak with its saw toothed edges and sharp hooked tip was bright red
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls hawks and eagles he had no rending calls
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but suddenly street and swift as a diving comrade he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: once fairly awing however he wheeled made back hurriedly for his perch
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and might have seemed that a trout of this size was a fairly substantial meal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but such was his keenness that even while the wide flakes of his engorge to victim were still sticking out of the corners of his beak his fierce red eyes of were once more appearing downward into the torrent and search of fresh prey
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and despair he hurled himself downwards too soon
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the break hawk followed hurriedly to retreat his prey from the ground
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the cat growled softly picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in fact he had just finished it the lasts of the trout's tale had just vanished with a spasm down his strange gullet when the baffled haw called sight of him and swooped
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if surprised
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: like his unfortunate little cousin the teel he too had felt the fear of deaths smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark over hanging bank deep fringe with weeds were the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: almost instantly you was forced to the top
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: straightway the hawk blighted from his perch and darted after him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but at this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but this frequenter of the heights of air for all his savage valor was troubled at the leaping waves in the tossing foam of these mad rapids he did not understand them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as he flew his down reaching clutching talons were not half a yard about the fugitive head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where the ways for an instant sank they came closer but not quite within grasping reach
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but as before the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer and he able to flap his way onward and a cloud of foam o doom hung lob above his head yet hesitated to strike
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged in pursuit as a weasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he had a lot of line out and the place was none too free for a long cast but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was speeding
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the last drop fly as luck would have it caught just in the corner of the hawks angrily open beak hooking itself firmly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the sudden sharps sting of it the great bird turned his head and noticed for the first time the fisherman standing on the bank
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: than the leader parted from the line
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he is a welcome figure at the garden parties of the elect who were always ready to encourage him by accepting free seats for his play actor managers nod to him ed ears allow him to contribute without charge to su impose him on the price of golf falls
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in short he becomes a prominent figure in one of society and a he is not careful somebody will say so
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: your plain must be not merely a good play but a successful one
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: frankly i cannot always say
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but suppose you said i'm fond of writing my people always say my letters home or good enough for punch
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i've got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman and but perhaps i be kep the plot of secret for the moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: any how was jolly exciting and i c into the dialogue all right

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: indeed irresolution mean the key out of hamlets soliloquy a clever player could to some extent indicate the whole thirty lines by a sila wor king of the jaw but at the same time it would be idol to deny that he would miss the finer shades of the dramatists meaning
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we moderns however see the absurdity of it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if it be granted first that the thoughts of a certain character should be known to the audience and secondly that soliloquy or the habit of thinking aloud is in opposition to modern stage tyne how shall have solo be avoided without damage to the play
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and so on till y get to the end when amelia might say ah yes or something non committal of that sort
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this would being easy way of doing it but it would not be the best way for the reason that it is too easy to call a kitchen to itself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the old badly made play it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the modern well constructed play he simply rings up an imaginary confederate and tells him what he is going to do could anything be more natural

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: while former foretold that the scottish cover enters were secretly forming a union with the english parliament and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking the latter still insisted that every such attempt would precipitate them into measures to which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the king's ears were now open to mont roses counsels who propos'd none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cause in stat rand
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: five hundreds men more who had been levied by the cover enters were persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combined force he hastened to attack lord alco who lay at perth with an army of six thousand men assembled upon the first mews of the irish invasion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: dreading the superior power of aral who having joined his vassals to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerable army montrose hastened northwards in order to rouse again the marquis of hooty and the gordons who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the covenanters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this nobleman's character though celebrated for political courage and conduct was very low for military prowess and after some skirmishes in which he was worsted he here allowed montrose to escape him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by quick marches through these inaccessible mountains that general freed himself from this superior forces of the covenanters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with these and some reinforcements of the ethel men and dawes whom he had recalled montrose fell suddenly upon ar giles country and let loose upon it all the rage of war carrying off the cattle burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this severity by which montrose sullied his victories was the result of private animosity against the chieftain as much as of zeal for the publick cause o guile collecting three thousand men marched in quest of the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at inner lucky supposing himself still at a considerable distance from them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by a quick and unexpected march montrose hastened to inner lucky and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised but not aff frightened cover enters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his conduct and presence of mind in this emergence appeared conspicuous
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mon trots weak in cavalry here lined his troops of horse with infantry and after putting the enemy's horse to rout fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cut in pieces nough with the loss of the gallant lord gordon on the part of the royalists
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the same men new regiments and new companies were formed different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands as the independence could rely on
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: besides members of parliament who were excluded many officers unwilling to serve under the new generals threw up their commissions and u warily facilitated the projects of putting the army entirely into the hands of that faction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible a more exact plan was introduced u rigorously executed by these new commanders
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: valor indeed was very generally diffused over the one party as well as the other during this period discipline also was attained by the forces of the parliament but the perfections of the military art in concerting the general plans of action and the operations of the field seems still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: historians at least perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience have not remarked and thing but a headlong impetuous conducted each party hurrying to a battle were valor and fortune chiefly determined the success
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he pass'd through henley sea albans and came so nears to london as haro on the hill
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the scottish generals and commissar as affected great surprise on the appearance of the king and though they paid him all the exterior respect due to his dignity they instantly sit a guard upon him under colour of protection and made him in reality a prisoner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they informed the english parliament of this unexpected incident and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: or hath he given usin gifts
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the men of israel answered the men of judah th said we have ten parts in the king and we have also more right in david thane yee why then did yee despise us that our advice should not be first had in bring back ours king
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: another preacher of to reproaching him to his face with his misgovernment ordered this sum to be son
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the kings stood up and cold for that some which begins with these words
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: have mercy lord upon me i pray for men with me devour
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the good natured audience in pity to fallen majesty show for once greater deference to the king than than to the minister th so the psalm which the former had called for
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the parliament and the scots laid their proposals before the king
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: before the settlement of terms the administration must be possessed entirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms and how incompatible that skin with the liberty of the king is easily imagined
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the english it is evident had they not be previously assured of receiving the king would never have parted with so considerable of some and while they weakened themselves by the same measure have strengthen to people with whom they must afterwards have so material and interest to discuss
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if any still retained rancor against him in his present condition they passed in silence while his well wishers more generous than prudent accompanied his march with tears with exclamations and with prayers for his safety
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his death in this conjuncture was a public misfortune
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual correlates all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that i is approximately represent impressions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and what sort of evidence is logically possible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with the population that remembered a wholly unreal pas
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: all that i'm doing is to use its logical tuna ability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the behaviourist who attempts to make psychology a records of behavior has to trust his memory in making the record
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but i do not think such an inference is warranted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ours confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a france face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some images like some sensations fill very familiar while others fell strange
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: familiarity is a filling capable of degrees
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of past ness especially where immediate memory is concerned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such fillings must play an essential part in the process of dating remember events
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problems of memory would have been comparatively simple
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: remembering has to be a present occurrence in some ways resembling or relighted to what is remembered
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vay
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the first of ours vague good butt indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly defined memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in ours knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problems with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gram phones as they like to believe
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfasts this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: simmons two books mentioned in an earlier lecturer do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they give laws according to which images of passed occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to pass occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is this that is a interest to theory of knowledge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leaves us to search the environment until we are satisfy that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling e familiarity alone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a further stage is recognition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more that a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain lynx of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thus if i recognize the thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is single out from the rest of the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: had either crasweller not been good looking had jack been still at college had sir kennington ovver remained in england had mister bonnet and the bar keeper not succeeded and stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in a raining for the final departure of my old friend
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on arriving at home at my own residence i shall that arslan was filled with a brilliant company
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mode of address that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i have come to your sure as mister president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing and this disan quarter of the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have our little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rose water
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we are quite satisfied now captain battle axe said my wife
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: quite satisfied said eva
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the ladies and compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic are on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed are on the other
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no doubt im process of time the ladies will follow
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: their masters said missus never beent
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i did not mean said captain battle ax the touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: missus never be you must indeed be proud up of your son
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: jack had been standing in the far corner the room talking to eva and was now reduced the silence by his praises
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sir kennington oval is a very fine player said my wife
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i and my wife and son and the two cress wells and three or four others agreed to dam bard the ship on the next
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this i felt was paid to me as being president other republic and i endeavored to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might be fit the occasion but i could not a feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my wife on the spur the moment managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with that
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part to fathers and mothers of the young ladies
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh yes a jack and i'm nowhere
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but i mean to have my innings before law
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of what missus never been had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her tasks with thorough success
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then went ashore
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how much of evil a real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me during the last few days
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we'll could i do now but just lay myself down and die
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the death of which i drug could not alas
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the furthers side of the island and there in seclusion what i end my days
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: jack would become either happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: think i of all this i went to sleep
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister never beent began the captain and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president there cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you have received us with all that courtesy in hospitality for which your character in england stand so high
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is a duty said i
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but your power is so superi to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace and yielding to it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not a doubt but had your force been only double or trouble our own i should have found that my duty to struggle with you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that is all quite true mister never be said sir ferdinand theyll brown
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can affords to smile because i am absolutely perilous before y but i do not the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you have come to us threatening us us with absolute destruction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have been on board
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then said sir fernando there was nothing for it but that we must take you with him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you hear what sir ferdinand go brown h sad replied captain battle ax
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but one is to delicate mission i asked
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhere or drown upon the voyage and mattered not which
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then the republican of britain ella was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor in stalled in the executive chambers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you may be quite shorts there said captain battle ax and that i can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you propose to kid not me i said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what we become of your gum were i to kidnap for you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: lieutenant cross tries is a very gallant officer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one of us always remains on board while the others on sure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible my dislike centered itself on sir ferdinand
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will allow me to suggest said he but that is a matter of opinion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where i to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the letter ran as follows
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sir i have an in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crowned colony which is called britain ella
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your excellencies knowledge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in their selection of a constitution the britain u lists have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprung their present difficulties
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is founded on the acknowledge weakness of those who savant that period of life at which men ceased to work
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but it is surmise that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your governor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the john bright is arm with a weapon of great power against which it is impossible that the people of britain ullo should prevail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will carry out with you wanted it men of the north northwest birmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own sturdy as it is thought that if mister never been be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when you intend that the john bright shall start
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to day i shouted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the archiv of the government
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i shall be happy to take charge of them said sir fernando
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they of course must all be otter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: your power is sufficient i said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if you will give us your promise to meet captain matt ox here at this time to morrow we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the john right for twenty four hours
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and this plan was adopted two in order to extract for me a promise that i would depart in peace
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this was what did the mischief so far as the running away was concerned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is hardly necessary to say more of them here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the manner in which he expressed himself with regard to robert holland no man in the whole range of his recollections will be longer remembered than he his enthrone while under holland will hardly ever be forgotten
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of this party edwards a bo of seventeen called forth much sympathy he too was claimed by holland
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: john wesley combat jacob taylor and thomas edwards skinner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the few years back one of their slaves a coachman was kept on the coach box one cold night when they were out at a ball until he became almost frozen to death in fact he did die in the infirmary from the effects of the frost about one week afterwards
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the doctor who attended the entered creature in this case was simply told that she slipped and filed down the stairs as she was coming down
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: another case said john wesley was a little girl half grown who was washing windows upstairs one day and unluckily fell asleep in the windows and in this position was found by her mistress in a rage the mistress hid her a heavy slap knocked her out of the windows and she fell to the pavement and died in a few hours from the effects thereof
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as usual nothing was done in the way of punishment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i never knew of but one man who could ever please him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he worked me very hoard he wanted to be beating me all the toime
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was a large homely woman they were common white people with no reputation in the community
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: substantially this was jacob's unvarnished description of his master and mistress
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as to his age and also the name of his master jacobs statement varied somewhat from the advertisement
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of starting i didn't knower the way to come
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it's almost beyond conjecture
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this reality begins to explained dark power and other worldly fascination of twenty thousand leagues under the seas
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: first as a paris thought broker later as a celebrated author and yachtsmen he went on frequent forages to britain america the mediterranean
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: name oo builds a fabulous futurists ex submarine the nautilus than conducts an underwater campaign of vengeance against his imperialist oppressor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in all the novel head a difficulty gestation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: others subtleties occurred inside each episode the textures sparkling with wit information and in sight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his specifications for an open sea submarine at a self containing diving suit or decades before their time yet modern technology theres the mount triumphantly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: even the supporting cast is shrewdly drawn professor aronnax the career scientists caught in an ethical conflict corse the compulsive classifier who supplies humorous tag lines for verne fast facts the harpooner ned land a creature of constant appetites man as heroic animals
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but much of the novels brooding power comes from captain nemo
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this compulsion leads nemo into ugly contradictions he is a fighter for freedom yet all who bored his ship are imprisoned there for good he works to save lives both human and animal y he himself creates a hole accost he detests imperialism yet he lays personal claim to the south bole
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and in this last action he falls into the classic sin of pride
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he's swiftly punished
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the nautilus nearly perishes in the antarctic and ne most sinks into a growing depression
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for many then end this book has been a source of fascination surely one of the most influential novels ever written and inspiration for such scientists and discoverers as engineer simon lake owe draper william b be polar travellers are earnest shackleton
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fathom six feet
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: graham roughly one twenty eighth of an ounce
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: milligram roughly one twenty eight thousandth of announce
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: leader roughly one court
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: metre roughly one yard three inches
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mill mater roughly one twenty fifth of an inch
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: chapter three as master wishes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: three seconds before the arrival of j p hobson's letter i know more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the northwest passage
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: even so i had just returned from an arduous journey exhausted and badly needing ar rest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wanted nothing more than to see that country again my friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved collections
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but now nothing could hold me back
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: crosse was my man's servant
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from rubbing shoulders with scientists inner little universe by the botanical gardens the boy had come to know a thing or two
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: classifying was everything to him so he do nothing else well verse and in a theory of classification he was poorly first in this practical application and a doubt that he could tell a sperm wale from a bellini
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and yet what a fine gallanted lad
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of the journey
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: never did he object to buckling up his suit case for any country whatever china or the congo no matter how far off it was
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he went here there and everywhere in perfect contentment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: place forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting that i had turned forty
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was a fanatic u formality and he only addressed me in the third person to the point were it got hys him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was good reason to stop and think even for the world's most in motionless man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cosey a called a third time conseil appeared
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: did masters summon me he said entering
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: back as much into my trunks as you can my traveling kit my suits shirts and socks don't bother counting just squeeze it all in and hurry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: weil deal with them lighter what
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it how will leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to france
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes we are certainly i replied evasively but after we make a detour
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a routed slightly less direct that's all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: were leaving on the abraham lincoln
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you see my friend it's an issue of the monster the notorious mor wal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we don't know where well take us
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but were going just the same
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have a commander whose game for anything
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i loved instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to paris france
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the barbarossa and conseil at my heels i jumped into a carriage
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate i rushed aboard
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i asked her commander fergit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one of the sailors led me to the after deck where i stood in the presence of a smart looking officer who extended his hand to me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in person welcome avoid professor your cabin is waiting for you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officers mess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will be quite comfortable here i told conseil
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some scepticism
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wharves of brookland and every part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: departing from five hundred thousand throats three tears burst forth in succession
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hailing the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new yorks city
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then he rose downstairs into the courtyards shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to patch every bunny in his dominions at the sailorman was not recaptured
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hold him fast my in and as soon as i had my coffee in it will i'll take him to the room of the great knife and patch him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wouldn't mind u col a coffee myself said cam bough i have had consider aboard cater sis this mornin an i'm mole or any for breakfasts
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but cap'n bill made no such a tempt knowing it would be uselessly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boolooroo get a yellow disappointment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the room of the great knife was high and big and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators the sit upon
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in one place at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant thrown chairs for the king and queen and six smaller but richly a poste chairs for this mends princesses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: therefore her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were folia gorges as to were haughty and overbearing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: morning earls so be pill as way you look
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: control yourselves my dears replied the boolooroo the worse punishment i know how toll inflict on anyone this prisoner is b to suffer you will see a very pretty patching my royal daughters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: suppose its of brain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the captain shook his head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why you sit to fetch the firs living city we met and that was this spy oat replied the captain panting hard as he held us to one of the goat's horns
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the idea of patching cap'n bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him and a more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter
