but the barre instead being maintain of the seated had taken and growled
the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hand he received they must stand further off
then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his positions and slowly entered the place
it was silent and gloomy being tenanted sly by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude be ing rigidly bounded both hands and feet by strong and painful wits th
the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
what shall we do with the mingles at the door they count six and the singers as goods nothing
the delawares are children of the towards in the out strict the dear
uncas who had already approached the door and readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
but hark ey who was too much occupied with his own thoughts note the movement continued speaking more to himselfe into his companions
so uncas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again intrust cunning for want of speeded
well what can't be done by main courage and war must be done by circumvention
as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david in gave him his parting instructions
my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little n ho that so directed and attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord evening in the greatest straits
if you are not then knocked on' the head your being and u composer will protective and you'll then have a good reasons to expect to dieing your bed
scuse for yourself to make a rush or tarry here
bravely and generously as he batted in my be ha and this and more will i dare in his service
kep silent his longest made be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will served to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be th
if however they tak her scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
holds david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i amen worthy humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for conditions he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practice myself as one without across a bloode though it do is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
god bless you friend i do believe your sent has not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural of gifts in the force of temptations
the della were dogs he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the others features is he afraid
will the hes here his groans
m he can started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counter fitted was about to make some desperate effort
he had no occasion to delay next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
lunch as cast is skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would served to limit the events to any particular place or give a clues to the people concerned
i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitations that was clear something very unusual had occurred
my friends temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
without his scrap books his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an
i had to reed over carefully as the tex must be absolutely correct
i was absent rather more than an hour
the only duplicate which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honest is absolutely above suspicion
the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had raged among my papers
the proof was in three longed slips i had left them all together
they'll turn was that some one passing her observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
i gave him a little brandy left him collapsed in the chair will im made a most careful sish of the room
a broken tip of lad was lying there also
not only this but on the tablet found a small ball of black doll or clay with spects of something which looks like sawest in it
above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
to the best of my belief they were rolled out up
did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
i was in such a hurry to come to you you left you door open
so it seems to me
now mister sons at your sposa
above were three stood s one each story
then he approached it and standing on tipt with his nec crain he looked into the room
there is no opening except the one paining said are learned guide
i am afraid there are no signs here said he
one could hardly hope for any upon so dry day
you left him in a chair you say which chair by the window there
the man entered and took the papers she by she from the central table
as a matter fact he could not said toms for i entered by the side door
h long would to taken to do that using every possible contraction the quarter an hour not less
then he tossed down and seized the next
he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
misters songs was someone overwhelmed by this flat of informations
homes held out a smalls ship with the letters and e and the space of clear wood
what's and i have always done you injustice there are others
i was hoping that if the paper which he wrote was thin some traced it might come through upon this polish surface n i see nothing
as homes the curtain that was aware from some little rigidity and in larn of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
home carn away and stooped suddenly to the floor hall what is this
homes out on his open palm in the glare of the elector c light
what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
i understanding to say that there are three stood int use this stair and are in the habit of passing your door yes there are
and there are all in for su examinations yes
one hardly lies to throw suspicions where there are no proofs
let us sit the suspicions i will look after the proofs
my scholar has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he willed do well
the top floor belongs to miles m clare
i donn not go so su far as that but of the three hes perhaps the least un likely
he was still suffering from from the sudden disturbance of the quiet retain of his life
by have occasionally th the same thing it other times
did you look at these papers on the tablet
how came you to leave the key in the door
anyone the room could get out yes sir
i really d think hee much bowed at mister homes
only for a minute or so
oh i would not venture to say sir
you haven't seen any of them no sir
it was the indian whose dark slewed appeared suddenly upon his blinded
he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
the set of rooms as quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors too go over them
no names please said homes as we not to go c her store
of of course he did not realize that it was ey who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances run suspicious
that is very importance in homes
you don't seem to realize the positions
to morrow was the examinations
i can't allow the examinations to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situations must be faced
it is possible though i may be an apposition then to indicate some course of action
i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings th by
when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
the found mouths fellow at the top
he is the one with the worst record
why bannister the servant whats his game in the matter
he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man
my friend did not appear to be depressed by his flier but shrugged his shoulders and half humorous resignations
no goods my dear watson
i think so you have former conclusion
yes my dear watson i have saw the mystery
look at bat he held out his hand
on the palm were three little permits of black do clay
and one more this morning
in a fewe hours the examinations would commence and he was still the del between making the facts publick and allowing the copper to compute for the value scholarship
he could hardly stand still so great his mental agitations and he ran towards holmes with two eager hands outstretched think heaven that you have come
you know him i think so
if this matter is not to become publick we must give ourself certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial
no sir certainly not
there was no man sir
his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon banister the farther corner
just close the door said homes
we want to know mister gil christ how you and honorable man ever came to commit such an actions that of yesterday
far a moment go christ with upraised hands tried to control his riving features
come come said homes kindly it is human to air and at least no one can accuse you being a calais criminal
well well don't tablet answer listen and see that i do you know injustice
he could examine the papers in his own office
the indian i also thought nothing of
when i approached your room i examined the window
no one less than that would have a chance
i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side tablet
he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided you are weare with several sharp spies
no harm would have been done had did not been that he pass your door he perceived the key which had have beene left by the carelessness of your servant
a sudden impulse came over him to enter and se if they were indeed the proofs
he put his shoes on the tablet
gloves saide the young man
suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
have i told the truth mister grist
i have a letter hear mister sums which i wrote to you ely this morning in the middle of a restless night
it would be clear to you from what i have said that only you couldn have had let this young man out since she were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out
it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you couldn know
if misters s saw them the game was up
in the debate between the singe societies her defense of the fifteenth moment had been nly a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
the south she had not thought of seriously in yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mile climate she was not avers to charles or newland's
john tailor who had supported her few college was interested in cotton
better gol he had council sententiously
might learn something useful down there
but john is no society just elementary work
then looking up toms county
f some curs wells there b plantations radiated two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
some other's too be cotton county
you ought too know john if i teach negros ill scarcely see much of people in my own glass
at any rate i say go
here she was teaching dirty children a smell of confused os bodily perspiration was to her times unbearable
she wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great filth pies in the forms
so frever hundred time she was thinking to day as she walked alone up the laying back of the barn and then slowly downed through the bottoms
carton shep
she had almost forgotten that it was here within touch in sight
a glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered in murmured before her stretching away of the northward
in m be a bit of port here and there but most of this place was such desperate prose
her regards shifted to the green stocks and leaves again and she started to move away
cotton is o wonderful thing is it not voic she said rather primly
mis tailor did that no much about cotton but at least one more remarked seem called four
don't know well of all things in would re commented miss tailor letter re born and cottin and o well as mc as to ask the use she turned again to go
i suppose th its too early for them then came explosions
good was don't grow on to tops vs but on to grown on the rats l cams is hes
the golden and fleece it's the silver lease he harkened
sim me tama le won't you
thou for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even that she had been talking just talking there were no persons of the conversations just things one thing cotton
the honorable child smith missa's brother was walking swiftly up tow for from mister easter lees wall street office and his face was pale
at last the cotton comb was to all appearances in assured facts and he was slated for the sin it
why should he not be as other men
she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence and others
as she awaited her g she sarve the tablet satisfactions and is quietude for her social functions were few tonight there were she j them off on her fingers sir james cried the rich english manufacture and lady citing mister missus banda pool mister harry cress well in his sister john tailor and his his sister and mister charles smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be u dis sine from ne jersey a selection of gas it had been determined unknowns to the hosts by the meeting of goon enterest earlier in the day
missus gr had met suns before but not intimately and she always had in m vividly there cruelty to poor negros a subject she made appoint of an introducing fork w
she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister cress well express himself so cordially as approving of negro educational
do believe in soom educational asked mary tailor
i believe in the train in of people to their has capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
but cress well added significantly capacity differs in no must lay between races
the brander pools were sure this and the englishman instant singing india became quite eloquent missus grey was mister fi but hardly dared amid it the general train of the conversations seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharper scrutiny before being aloud much educational and ask forth that low or races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
fs t m hick added cress well a abiding his sister's eyes
but we no exactly welcome
mary ta however related the tale of z to missus grace pried ear later
fortunately said mister band fool nor band sabers all roving had b a mutual understanding on most of these matters
he knew the silver flees piss as must be ruined
it was the first great sorrowed his life it was not so much the loss of the cotton itself but the fantasy the hopes the dreams built to rounded
ah the swamp the cruel swam
the revelations of his love lighted and brighten slowly to l flinging like a sun rise overhanging wonder
he panted to know if she too new or new and cared not cared and knew not
she was so strange in human a creature
the world was water veiled and mists
then of a sudden ad midday the suns shot out hot and still no berth of air stirred the sky was like lu steal the earth steam
where was the use of imagining
the l g had been level with the dies awe to go and now
perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly
splashed to step long farther and farther onward until he near the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
then he looked down the look was dry
he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheat of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of all of green th tall wet and willowy
the squares of cottin sharp age cabby were just about worse to balls
for one long moment he passed stupid agate with otter amazement then lanzi against the tree
he gazed about re flexed astonished
here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite working pain someone had doted can now from the lag to the creek into which the former had drained by long and cook it way thus allowing it to empty directly
he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost so
the years of the days of her dying were ten
the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
up in the sick rooms or lay on the little wide bed
the that and we of endless things had been crawling in creeping around her she had struggled in dum speechless terror again some mighty grasping that stroll for her life with nold and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she open her eyes and questioned
for while she lay in her chair in happy dream me pleasure at son bird tree
she rose with the fleeting glance gathered the sh rounder then gliding forwards wavering tremulous slip across the road and into the swamp
she had been born within its porters within his bore she had lived and grown and with in its border she had met her love
on she hurried until sleeping down to the lag and the island lo the cotton l before her
the cha was empty when he knew
he darted though the trees and posted a tall man strongly but slimily made

heady seir often too the opportunity when hers back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflections of herself in those polished services for the oak tablet was usually turned up like a screen and was more for ornament than for use and she could see you herself sometimes in the great round put dishes there were arranged on the shells above the longed deal did her tablet or in thebes of the great which always shown like jasper
do not suppose however that missus poison was elderly or shrewish and her appearance she was a goodlooking woman not more than eight in thirty a fair complexion and sandy hair well shapen light footed
the v like between her and hern stan amorous with a contrast between her keenness and dinas sur rhea gentleness of expression might have served the per as an excellent suggestions for a martha in mary
her tongue was not less keen than her eye whenever a dams came with ar shot seem to take up an unfinished l sure as a barrow organ takes opportune precisely at the point where it had left off
the fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the wows and why consequently missus poison should scolded molly the house mid with unusual severity

everything he is done has been aim that the conservation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against seriously
it couldn not be used for elector plating or deposition nor could charged rage batteries all of which are easily within thea ability of the duc cur
but when it king to be questioned of lighting a scattered sub a group of dwellings on the outskirts amon country residence or a fi mouse the alternating current in all elements sa its danger was ands ideal

he soon four saw that still greater economy would be necessary four commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact district of large cities
the strong position held by the edison system under the strenuous competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate emphasis too incessant lighting

i think he was perhaps more appreciative that i was of the discipline of the edison construction to upon and fought it would be well for us to wait until the morning the fourth before we started up

there was infinite skepticism around him on the subjects and while other invents were also giving the subject bethought the public took at it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that couldn not be seen or wed and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact pointed use could not be brought to accurate registration
hence the absent electric neet is no longer used despite its a excellent qualities
the principal employed in the eson electric meet is that which exemplifies the power electricity to dee com ipse a chemical substance
associated with the this simple forme of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operations freedom from in accuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit five current or damage
the standard edison meter practice was to remove theves once a month to the meter room of the central stations company fore examinations another's sat being substituted

the meter continued in generals service during eighteen ninety mind and probably up to the close of the century

poor alice
it was the lite rabbit returning splendidly dressed the pair white kid gloves in one ha and a large fan in the other he came trotting long in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess
oh what she be savage if i've kept her waiting
al was tok up the fan and gloves and as the hale was veryain hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went a talking dear dear how queer everything is to day

it'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dere
i'm so very tired to being all alone here
and i declare it's too bad that it is
i wish i hadn cried so much said alice as she swim about trying to finder way out
i shall be punished fort now i suppose by being thrown in my own tears

we want you to help us published some leading work of luthers for the general american market will youd do it

let us begin with that his commons uglies
the undertaking which seemed so attractive in viewed as a literary task proved the most difficult one and at times became oppressive
it was written in latin
the word hadad to be convinced
word should now be set about the origin of luther's commentary incitations
much later when a friend of his was preparing additions of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way aboute its they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my delians for instance and
in other words these three men took down the lectures which lu ad dressed wests and the course of glaces and roar prepared the man scrip for the printer
it presents like no other of luthers wrings the central thought of christianity the justifications of the sinner for the sake of chris merits alone
but the essence of luthers lectures is there
the lord who was given as power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and tod loo too
the word of our god shall stand for ever
in every way they so to undermining authority of sein paul
they said to the galatians you have no right to think highly of paul
he was the last to turned christ
poking later in his beneath us
indeed he persecuted the church of chris for a long time
do you suppose that god for the sake of af fewe through tics with don his entire church
against these boasting false apostles pall boldly defence his a ast authority and ministry
as the am baser of a government is honoured for his office and not fir his private person so the minister of cry should exult his office in ord gain authority among m
cults prim his ministry not to his own pas but to the praise of god
paul and apostle not of men it cetera
yit he called ministers to the agency of men or recalls them directly as he called the profits in apostles
paa the clays at the false apostles were call her sent neither by men mor by man
the most they could clime is that they were sample others
he mentions the possest first because they were point d rector by god
because not to be taken lightly
for person of his est knowledge is not enough
his spoils one's best work
when i was a young man i thought pul was making too much of his c
i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
i know nothing of the doctor of faith because we were toss so facer instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
this is no sinful pride it is holly pride

and all the bread room which are with me
this should go far and shouting the mouths of the false su poses
although the breather with me are not apostles like myself yet there all of one mind with me think right and teaches i do
they do not go with the enemies of the gospel prominent they g go with the questions are
why they not invaded the catholic provinces and preached their her doctrine to god this princes bishops and doctors as we have them by the help of god
we looked for that reward which i h not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man
not all the citations had become prevert it
these means cannot be continent
they remained divine regardless of mens opinions
wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church even though ant christ reams there
so much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the apostle verse three
grace be too you in peace for from god the fathers and from our lor jesus christ
the terms of grace and peace common terns with paul and are now pretty well understood
the grating of the apostles refresh
grace and vs the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
the world brands this of permission doctrine
experience process
however the grace and piece of god will
m should not speculate about the nature of god
was it not enough to say from god the fathers
to do so is to lose goot altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek the measure to comprehend is infinite majesty
he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes me fasten upon him
embrace him and forget about the nature of god
did not christ himself say i am the way in the truth and the life no man cometh too the father but by me
when you are you about the nature of god apart from the questions of justifications you may be as profound as you like
we are to hear christ to has been a printed by the fathers our divine teacher
at the same time pal confirms are creed that christ his very god
that christ is very gods apparent in that paul scribes to him divine powers equally with the fathers as for instance the power the spens grace and peace
to bestow piecing grace lies in the province of god who long congreve his blessings the angels couldn
otherwise paul should of written grace from god the fathering peace from l jesus cric
the carians took cric for a noble gol in perfect creature superior evening to the angels because by him god created heaven earth
mohammed also speedily of christ

under score these words for their they are fu of comfort for sor consciences
how m we obtain remission of our sins
pianers the man who is nan jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for a since
since christ was given for our sons it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by her own efforts
this sentence also to fins our sins as great so great in fact that the whole worlds could not make ams for a single soon
the greatness of the ransom christ son of god indicates this
the vicious character' of sen his brought out by the words who gave himself for a sins
but we are careless we make light of sin
we think that by some little work merit we can the smiths
this passage then d's out the fact that at all maner solder sin
this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin as a small matter easily taken care of by good works that we must present oursel in to god with a good conscience that we must feel no son before may field that christ was given for our sins
this s atitudes universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better another's
but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
on the other hand we are not to regard them is so terrible that we must despair

with rises he acknowledges the perpetual flocks like ane sagas he ass the predominance of min although admitting an element of necessity which reasoned is incapable of subjectivity of the worlds to be contained in number
many if not all the elements of the pre socratic philosophy are included in the teas
it a is probable that the relations of the ideas god or of god to the worlds differently we conceived by him at different times of his life
the ideas also remained but they have become ties in nature forms of men animal spurs fishes

it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising for from such an origin has passed into every day speech as a sinon for noble or gentle
the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
with many qualifications with more qualifications u as the patriarchal tradition has bread weaken the general r is fell to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters

what is sling
we have never understood this sword of objections
slang is odious
slaying makes one shudder
who did nice that of course it does

we have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and at least a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted in fulfill marids

there is the sling of the affected lady as well as of the presses

pince veryain good
even dii what l that pass
to this we reply and one word only
assuredly if the tongue which nations or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study

young fits had been commanded to his mother's chamber so as soon as he had come out from converts with the squire
there be fell an anxious interview misters fs arguing foreign against the squires projection a breath
most of all robin thought of his father but would he counsel

yet he will tea you a few tricks when morning is come
there was no chance alter his sleeping room to one nearer to gain ms chamber
presently he crossed the fl of his room with decided step
will cried he softly and stoutly who would chosen his count across the door of his young master's chamber sprang up at once at answer
we will go out together to the bower there is away down to the court from my window
rest and be still until they warn you
the hours pasted wearily by and move it could yet be heard about the hall
at last all was quiet and black in the courtyard of game well
will whispered drop opening his door as he spoke are you ready
they then renewed their journey and under the better light made to save crossing of the stable roofs
robin entered to hot dragging the unwilling quire
be not so foolish friend said f to crossly
they moved there after cautiously aboute the hut groping before about them to find something to show that the binton had for filled his mission
they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stoutly had tripped over the edge of the reversed flat mouth of this pit
fitz ohs hand rested at last upon the top run of a latter and sly the truth came to him
robin carefully descended the later and found himself soon upon firm rocky grounded
studley was by his side and the flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and characters of vault
from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice wantons
save me masters but you startled me rarely
cried he waving the lantern before him to maure that these were no ghosts and front of him
inquired robin with his suspicions still upon him
truely such a horse would be worth much a noting him fair
n day loring answered warrenton with a half laugh
won spoke thus with sifts to show robin that he was not think jeff claimed to the estate willy passed by
robin fits saw that his doubts of won had beene fair and he became ashamed himself for herb bringing them
his tones ring pleasantly un wantons ears and forth with the goodfellow ship was hild it between them
the olds servant told him quietly as they crep back to gain wil this passage way led from the hut in a pleasance to sure wood and that jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
he implores as to be discreet as the grave in this matter forsooth his life as in the hollow of our hands
they regained their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gan well
out in the wood stood a nic little fur trey
the place he had was a very good one the sun shown on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and rounded him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as firs
he did not think of the warm son and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and pratt when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
but this was what the tree couldn not bear to hear
in winter when the snow lag glittering on the grounds a hair would often come leaping along and jumped right overt the little tree
oh that made him so angry
to grow and gran to get older and be to thought the tree that aftermost of light ful thing in the worlds
in autumn the wood cutters always came and felled some of the largest trees
this happened everye year and the young fir try that had now grown to a very c la sized trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earths and cracking the branches were loped offs and the trees looked longed and bear they were hardly to be recognized and then they were lat in carts and the horses dragged them out of the wood
have you not meet them many w
rejoys in i growth said the sunbeams
and' then what happens the
i would f now if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
i am now tall and my branch spread like the others that were carried off last year oh
where i but already on the carts
where i in the worn room with all the splendor in magnificence
yes and something better something still pre will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ornament me
something better something still grander must follow but what
re choice our presence said the air and the sunlight
rejoice in my own fresh youth
but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter in summer
and towards christmas he one of the first that was cut downe
the ax struck deep into the veryain the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pangs like a swoon he couldn not think of happiness for he you was sorrowful that being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little blushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
the departure was not at all agreeable
the tree only came to himself when he unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one splendid we don't want the others
there two were large easy chairs silken soils large tables full of picture box and full of toys were hundreds and the hundreds of crowns at least the childrens and so
the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
this evening they all said
howe it will shinin miss evening
perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to lookit me
it blazed up famously help help
cried the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire
a story
a story cried the children drawing the little fat man towards the tree
but i shall telle only one story
how be don't bey felled downstairs and yet he mary the princess
that's the way of the world
thought the fer trey and believed at all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
im won't trembled to morrow thought the fur tree
and the whole night the tree stood still and indeed thought
in the mornings the servants and the house main came in
but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here it a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
on's the meaning of this thought the tree
and he leaned against the wall lost in revery
time enough had he too for his reflections for days and knights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in the corner out of the way
t is now winter out of doors thought the tree
how kind man is after all
if only would not so dark here and so terribly lonely
squeak s quick
they snuff about the fir trey and rustled among the branches
i am by no means old said the fur tree
there's med a one considerably older than i am
they were so extremely curious
i know no such place said the tree
and then he told all about his youths and the little mice had never heard the light before and they listened and said
said the fir tree thinking over what he had himself related
yes in reality those more happy times
who is op dumpy asked the mice
only that one answered the tree
it is a very stupids story
don't you know one about bacon and tell canes can tell an later stories
no said the tree
then good b said the rats and they went h
at last the little ms state away also and the tree side after all it was veryain pleasant when the sleek little m sat rounded me and listened to what i told them
now that too was over
why one morning there came a quantity of people and set tow work in the loft
the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and throne rather their hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
but it was not the fir tree the big mens
it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
the golden star of tins was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
in the courtyards some of the mary children were playing who had danced at christmas round theer tree and were so glad at the side of him
and the gardeners boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap ling there
the wood flamed splendidly under the large bring copper and its sid so deeply
however that was over now the tree gone the story at ant end

no words were spoken no language was uttered say that of wailing in hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and la e reality
i heard a alose behind i turd ands cher his black eyes shining wall in his handy held a gleaming knife he lifted above his head as if to strike but i had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me
on wor said a distant voice
no sound broke the stillness of the nighte
the story of its evil fluids came back to me and in my bewilder conditions i wondered whether there was not some truth than what hadad beens
what was that
wh then i human hand large shapely appear distinctly on the surface of the pond
nothing more nod even the wist too which it m be attached
it didn not beckon or indeed move all he was as stiller as the handed of death
i aw to consciousness fighting at first as seemed as if i was finding with the fantom but gradually my pon it became more real to me it was caper
a sound of voices a flash of light
a feeling a freedom and i was a wake where

i had scarcely known when i have had been saying or doings up to this time but as he spoke i looked that at my hand
in the lighter the moon i sawn knife read with blooded and my end too was also discolored
i do not know i i am dazed bewildered
but that is caffs life
i know he had it d very evening
i revert saying if we been together
we chair picked up something for from the grounds and looked at it
i say youd do know what this means and you must tell us
a terrible thought flashed into my mined
i had again been acting under the influence of this man's power
perchance too caffs death might serve him and good stead
my tone refused a tak my power of speech laft me
my position was too terrible
my over brot n seal did at last
for some time after that i remembered nothing distinctly
the three modes of management
to suppose that the objects of this work is to aid in affecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
by reason an affections
as the chase drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicioned of her mother' disappointment vexations and ill humour seir and swell among those delegate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps and a reparable injury
the mother as soon as the chase is so far turned that mary can no longer watch the expression of her confidence goes away from the door with a smile of complacency an satisfactions on her face at the ingenuity and sue cess of her little artifice
so you will be a goods girl i know and m make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't you
the mothers in managing the case in this way rise partly un convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affections
if yous should not be a good girl but should show signs of making any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone
but this last su opposition is almost always un necessary fort if marry has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble
it is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the younger and of cultivating their reason and securing their affections can not be overrated
to such persons these indirect motes of training children inhabits of subordination too their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
della had a young sister na and a cousin whose name was jan
now ga contrived to obtained great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dar
to give idea of these conversations i will report one of them in four
you have come and della and della was the name of jams to make rosy a v it
i am veryain glad
i expect you have been a very goode girls and della since you were hear last
then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone h shep been a good girl jane
for instance one day the children had been plain upon the paps with blocks and other play things and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the panza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
they were now playing with their dolls in the parlour
delia came to the parlour and with an air of great mystery beckon the children aside and set to them ino whisper leave and dea and rosy here and don't say award to them
so singing she led the way on tic to followed by the children out of the room and rm by a scoot to the panza there
said she pointing with the play things see
put these ply things all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know anything about jan them mount
and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them dispose to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any director rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally too them would have been
nature of the effect produced by early impressions
that is comparatively nothing
they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
without going to any such extreme as this we can easily se on reflection how vast in influence on the ideas and conceptions as well is on the principes of action in the sure years must be exerted by the nature and characters of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impress upon the mind
the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a fathers subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
but ands cared nothing about that
he made a about so deep that his back came near breaking and he was done founded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but ands
he was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife
now this knife was a splendid one though half the blab was gone and handle was a little crac and enders new that one is all most a man as soon as one has a jack knife

on hu silver platters were permit of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering the canters
the prince set down under a blue canopy with b case a roses and she let and her sit in a golden chair by her side
but you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to they get off
the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly like to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made hee would not give up on any conditions
he only shook his head
well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him
that is a veryain fine cap you have he said
so what is said handers
and it is made of mother's best yard and shem knitted at herself and everybody once to get it away from me
with one jump ands got out of his chair
he darted like an arrow through all the halls downed all the stairs and across the yard
he still held u too it with bo hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their ms open
but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a king's golden crown he said that enders a stupid

but his mother hu been close
no my little son shes said
if youd dressed him sil and gold from top to to you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap
at the conclusion of the bank which was served at five o' clock the king entered his cabinet were his tails or awaiting him for the purse of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imaginations and had caus so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornate workers of the court

the news circulated with the rapidity of lightning during its progress it kindled every vive coquetry desire and wild ambition
the king had completed his tott by nin o'clock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers
the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent days or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theatre of wonderful elegance of construction

the seasons alle of spring followed him closely to form a quite drill which after many words of more less flattering import was the commencement of the ance
his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to grat advantage in flesh coloured scan hoes a silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
there was something in his carriage which resembled the boy movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much is seemed to so alone

sire he said your majesties most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he has already shone on the field of battle
the king seemed only pleased with everyone present
monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter
the valley began the effect was more than beautiful
when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untired pam of that period only the more natural on account of the vari and different acting of the august actors had reached its common in point of triumph the theatre shook with tumultuous applause
disdainful of a successive which madame showed no acknowledgment he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the market preference of the princess
by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided int regret and uneasiness sol that as limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupified
with the king who had from this moment become in reality the principle dancer the quad real cast a luck upon his vanquish rival
everyone one could observe his agitations and prostration a prostration which was indeedy morey markable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side head bewildered and his eyes with all their bright intelligence be deemed
upon this madame dan to turn her eyes languishingly towards the com observing
d you thinks so she replied with indifference
yes the characters which your royal highness as soon is in perfect harmony with your own

the princess inquired no
she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance
the ar peers his heart and wounded him mori
ac quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theatre but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love is th strangely constituted he founded impossible even to remained much longer separated from their presence of one who had broken his heart
when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in the bidest of idea she was desirous have concealing from herself

let us run then set all three and gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thickest covered of the park
in fact the sound of mades and a queen's carriages could be heard in the distance upon the hard dry ground at the roads followed by the mountain cavaliers

thesis of knowledge will occupies until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
what is called perceptions direst from sensations by the fact that the sensational indians bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual courts all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensations
whether there are not dis principal is liable to a exceptions everyone would agree that it has broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more corrected to say that i is approximately represented impressions
and what sort of evidence is logically possible
there is not logical impossibility and hypothesis that the world sprang too being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with the populations that remembered wholly uns
all that im dinging is to use its logical tina ability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
the behavior us to attempts to make scholar a record of behavior has to trust his memory and making that the record
habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist fills confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
but i do not think such an inference is warned
our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a france face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
some images like some sensations fill very familiar while others fill strange
familiarity as a filling capable of degrees
in an image of a well known face for example some parts may fill more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
they must have some characteristic which makes us regarded them as preferring too morea less remote portions of the past
in actual fact their are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the filling of greater or less remoteness and some remembered event
there may be specific filling which could be called the filling of pasts especially where immediate memory is concerned
there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relations of a remembered ev to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of fillings giving their temporal relations to the present but it is clear that such fillings must play and essential part and the process of dating remember evans
if we had retained the subjected or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
rememberings to be a present oc curs and someway resembling or related too what is remembered
some points may be taken fixed and such as any theory of memory must arriv
in this case as in most others what may be taken a certain and advance is rather v
the first of our vague but indubitable data set there as knowledge of the past
we might provisionally th perhaps not quite correctly de fine memory as that way of knowing about the pasts which has no an log in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least served to marked the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards id mediate sey
this distinctions vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate too us the incidence of its pasts and people are not so different from from ground offence as they liked to believe
i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to e for breakfast this morning and can hardly be holly habit that enables me to do this
the fact that a man can recite a poem does not showed that he remembers any previous occasioned on which he has resided or read
symons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
they give laws according to which images of pass occurrences come too our mindes but do not discuss our belief at these images refer to pasted occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge of memory
it is this that is aventures to theory of knowledge
it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it lees to search the environment until wear satisfied that we have founded the appropriate objected which lees us to the judgement this is familiar
thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from for from the filling of familiarity alone
a furthers stage is recognition
recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more that a habit of associations the kind of object wear seen at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of paring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognized an objected that we have seen it before but this judgement is something over and above recognition in this first since and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition and this first since of the word
this knowledge is memory and one sense though in another it is not
there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is in adequate to agin with am sing at first sight more corrects to define recognition as i have seen this before then as this has existed before
the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything thats connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory a among the most important
thus if i recognized the thing the occasion of its previous existence and virtue of which i recognized it forms part of my experience by definition the recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is single out from the rest of the world
of course the words this has existed before are a very in adequate translations of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means permit and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as it recognition

you have received thus with all that curra sey in hospitality for which you characters in england stand so high

the pity th we must come and go
while the old gold and marbles days forever gloaming is soft charm blaze call in early evening glow
pleasant gr yard of my soul with sentimental cumbrous trees and flowers is filled that i may stroll and meditations at my ease
it is my heart hung in the sky and no clouds ever float between the grave flowers and my heart on high
over the track line city street the young men the greying men pass
h y sails that seemed to wonder and dream thrilled meadows say is the shore where i stand the only filled of struggle or are y hit and better out there by waves and one gust as tack over a clashing sea of watery echoes
old dances are simplified of their yarning bleached by time
he had got int her courtyard
through the black night rain he saying too her window bars
that was but rustling of dripping plans in the dark
she was alone that night
he had broken into hert courtyard
to fad away like morning beauty from from her mortal day down by the river of a donna her soft voices heard and thus her gentle lamentations falls like morning do
oh life of this o springing
why fades the lades of the wer
why fad these children of the spring

like the debts voice like transient day like musick in the air ahhh
and gentle sleep the sleep of deaths and gently hear the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time
the ly of the valley bathing in the humble grass answered the love we made and said i am a watch re weeded and i am very smalls and loft dwell in lowly veils so week the gilded butter fly scarce purchase on my head yet im visited from heavens and he that smiles on all walks in the vy and each morn over me spreads his handed singing rejoice thou humble grass thou newborn lily flower
thou gentle made of silent vallies and of modest brooks for thou shall be clothed in light and fed with morning mana till summers heat melts the bid the fountains and the springs de flourish in eternal veils they why should fell complain
why should the mistress of the veils of har atter a s
she ceased and smiled tears then sat downed in her silver shrine
which thou dust scatter on everye little blade of grasp thats springs revives the milked cow and tames the fire breathing steed
but thou is like a faint cloud kindle that the rising sun i vanish from my ply throne and who shall find my place
and why it scatters its bright beauty through the human

oh little cloud the virgin said i charged thee to tell me why thou complains now when in one hour thou fate away then we shall seek the but not find ah fell is liked to thee
i passed away yet i complain and no one' hears my voice
the cloud then showed his golden head and his bright form emerged a
and forest because i finish and i seen no more
it is too ten full life till love to peace and raptures wholly unseen descending way my light wings upon bobby flowers and court the fair i do to take me too her shining intent the weeping virgin trembling meals before the risen sun
to we arise lin and a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flows
lives not alone nor of itself fear not and i will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt here its
come forth warm and the silent valley to thy pensive queen
the helpless warm or rose and sad upon the les lef and the bright cloud sail on defined his partner in the veil
image of weakness ar thou but a worm
i see they away help lessen naked weeping and none toc ser none to cherish the with mothers smiles
and says thou mothers of my children i have loved thee and i have given in the a crown that none can take aways
and lay me downed in ey cold bed and leave my shining lot
or i of gifts and graces showering fruits coined gold
why a tong impressed with honey from from everye wind
why an ear a world po fierce to draw creations in
alway set without a word
i s bath thy looks as children do in the news son with souls that tremble through their happy islands from an un averred yet prall inward joy
i did not wrong myself so but i placed a wrong on the
