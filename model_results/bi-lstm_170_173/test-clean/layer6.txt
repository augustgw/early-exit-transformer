he hoped there would be stew for dinner turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in thick peppered flower fatten sauce
stuffed into you his belly counseled him
after early nightfall the yellow lamps would light up here and there the squalid quarter of the brothels

the music came nearer and he recalled the words the words of shelley's fragment upon the moon wandering companionless pale for weariness
the dull light fell more faintly upon the page where on another equation began to one fold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tale
a cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul
the chaos in which his ardour extinguished itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself
at most by an alms given to a beggar whose blessing he fled from he might hope wearily to win for himself some measure of actual grace
well now ennis i declare you have a head and so has my stick
on saturday mornings when the sodality met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a cushioned kneeling desk at the right of the altar from which he led his wing of boys through the responses
her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity her holiness a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail flesh did not humiliate the sinner who approached her
if ever he was impelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be her night
he tried to think how it could be
but the dusk deepening in the schoolroom covered over his thoughts the bell rang
then you can ask him questions on the catechism dedalus
stephen leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler listened to the talk about him which heron checked from time to time by saying
it was strange to that he found an arid pleasure in following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own condemnation
the sentence of saints james which says that he who offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all had seen to him first a swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own state
if a man had stolen a pound in his youths and had used that pound to a mass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to to give back the pound he had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest a crew upon it or all his huge fortune
if a laymen in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child baptized
how comes it that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor of heart the second the attitude promises also to the meek that they shall possess the land
why was the sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and wine if jesus christ be present body and blood soul and divinity in the bread alone and in the wine alone
if the wine chang into vinegar and the host crumble into corruption after they have been consecrated is jesus christ still present under their species as god and as man
a gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged stephen to ask a difficult question
the rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from
he clasped his hands on the desk and said
the retreat will begin on wednesday afternoon in honour of saint francis z saviour whose feast day is saturday
on friday confession will be heard all the afternoon after beads
beware of making that mistake
stephen's heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flour
he is called as you know the apostle of the indies
a great saint saint francis saviour
the rector paused and then shaking his clasped to hands before him went on
he had the faith in him that moves mountains
a great saint saint francis zau
in the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny glow
he could wait no longer
for a full hour he had paced up and down waiting but he could wait no longer
he set off abruptly for the bull walking rapidly lest his father's shrill whistle might call him back and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was safe
the university
bride after satisfaction uplifted him like long slow waves
whose feet are as the feet of hearts and underneath the everlasting arms
the pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused
soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding
the uncouth faces pass him to by two stained yellow or red or livid by the sea and as he strove to look at them with ease and indifference a faint stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face
angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallows swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their top heavy silk cats and humble tape like collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes brother hickey
brother mc carle brother kop
their piety would be like their names like their faces like their clothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts it might be paid a far richer tribute of devotion than his had ever been a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration
it was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates stripped of his pride beaten and in beggar's weeds that they would be generous towards him loving him as themselves
idle and embittering finally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbor as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love
the phrase and the day and the scene harmonized in accord
words was it their colors
they were voyaging across the deserts of the sky a host of no ms on the march voyaging high over ireland westward bound
the europe they had come from lay out there beyond the irish sea europe of strange tongues and valley and wood begirt and citadel and of entrenched and marshall races
again again
a voice from beyond the world was calling
hello stephanus here comes the dedalus
there dying stone poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges and the rough hewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horse play gleamed with cold wet lustre
he stood still in deference to their calls and parried their banter with easy words
it was a pain to see him and a sword like pain to see the signs of adolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness

you will find me continually speaking a foremen titan hob turner and tin cost the same terms
they unite every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists sometimes as cius crests
by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the cure occurs devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing un separated light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light
my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side
some of the touches indeed when the tint has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge

the brown ground beneath his left for the most part one touch of black as put for the hollow to delicate lines of dark gray to find the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of ema
for believe me the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock robin is to be read and of a grass plot to be green and the best skill of art is in instantly seizing on the manifold delicious ness of light which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch
now you will see in these studies that the moment the whit enclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of u treated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds and the round window will tell as jewels if they are grated justly
but in this van yet copied from turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly
they are beyond all other works than i know existing dependent for their effect on low subdued tones their favorite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight and even there brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of grey paper
and may be that a great colourless will use his utmost force of color as a singer his full power of voice but loud or little the virtue is in both cases always in refinement never in lowed

do not therefore think that the gothic schools and easy one
the law of that schools that everything shall be seen clearly or least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground
this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact your producing jeweler's work rather than pictures
that a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous
in all early gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art
the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill drawn figures that is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school
but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquillity of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purest painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life
you must look at him in the face fight him conquer him with what scathe you may you need not think to keep out of the way of him
the colorist says first of all as my delicious parquet was ruby so this nasty viper shall be black and then is the question can i round him off even though he is black and make him sly me and yet springing and close down clotted like a pool of black blood on the earth all the same
nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on new more more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter
you know i have just been telling you how this school materialism in clay involved itself at last and cloud and fire
here is an equally typical greek school landscape by wilson lost wholly in golden mist the trees so slightly drawn that you don't know if they are trees or towers and no care for colour whatsoever perfectly deceptive in marvellous effective sunshine through the mist apollo and the python
now here is ra fl exactly between the two trees still drawn leaf by leaf wholly formal but beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance
well then last here is turners greek school of the highest class and you de find his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire
only there are two sorts of cloud and far
he knows them bath
there is one and there another the dudley and the flint

in both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature th suffering is still dignified and beautiful
every line in which the master traces it even where seemingly negligent as lovely and set down with a meditative calmness which makes these two etchings capable of being placed beside the most tranquil work of whole bin or dure
but now here' is the subject of which you will wonder at first why turner drew it at all
it has no beauty whatsoever no specialty of picturesqueness and all its lines are cramped and poor
the crampons in the poverty are all intended
it is a gleaner bringing down her one' sheaf of corn to an old water mill itself mossy and rent scarcely able to get it stones to time
the scene is absolutely arcadian

it will be well for you if you join not with those who instead of kites fly falcons who instead of obeying the last words of the great cloud shepherd defeat his sheep lived the lives how much less than vanity of the war wolff in the gurgle

it was this observation that drew from douglas not immediately but later in the evening a reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call attention
some one else told stinging up particularly effective which i saw he was not following
cried one of the women he took no notice of her he looked at me but as if instead of me he saw what he spoke of
there was a unanimous gran at this and much reproach after which in his preoccupied way he explained
the stories written
i could right to my man and enclosed the key he could send down the packet as he finds it
the others resented postponement but it was just as scruples a charmed me
to this his answer was prompt o thank god know and is the record yours
he hung fire again a woman's
she has been dead these twenty years
she sent me the pages in questioned before she died
she was the most agreeable woman i'd ever known in her position she would have been worthy of any whatever
c simply that she said so but that i knew she hadn't i was sure i could see
you're easily judge why when you hear because the thing had been such a scare he continued to fix me
you are acute
he quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair
probably not till the second post
it was almost the tone of hope everybody will stay
cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed
missus griffin however expressed the need for a little more light
who was it she was in love with the story will tell i took upon myself to reply oh i can't wait with the story the story won't tell said douglas not in any literal vulgar way mores the pity then
won't you tell douglas
well if i don't know who she was in love it i know who he was
let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall presently give
poor duglas before his death when it was in sight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth
the departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't of course thank heaven stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a rage of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up
the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tail at a point after it had in a manner begun
he had for his own town residence of big house ill with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in essex that he wished her immediately to proceed
the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time
they were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority
i don't anticipate
she was young untried nervous it was vision of serious duties and little company of really great loneliness
yes but that's just the beauty of her passion
it was the beauty of it
it sounded dull that sounded strange and all the more so because it is main condition which was
she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded
but it was that all her reward one of the ladies asked
how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became everyday more brilliant and the intelligence that through its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
god as a directed consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonored bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
yet these thoughts affected hester prime less with hope than apprehension
the child had a native grace which does not invariably co exist with faultless beauty its attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best
this outwards mutability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life
hester could only account for the child's characters and even then most vaguely and imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that moment period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth
they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind
hester prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge
as to any other kind of discipline whether address to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment
it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not have questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human child
beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has evoked the spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world
pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance
if spoken to she would not speak again
hester pry went one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroider to his order and which were to be warned on some great occasion of state bore though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy
another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
at that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter publick interest and a far less in twins weight than the welfare of hester enter child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state
the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature
we have spoken of pearl's rich and luxuriant beauty a beauty that shown with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depths and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black
it was the scarlett letter in another form the scarlett letter endowed with life
the mother herself as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture
but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance
come therefore and let us fling mut at them
but pearl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight
she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them
it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times
they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were lattice windows the wooden shutters to close over them that need
lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester pryin gave a summons which was answered by one of the governor's boon servants a freeborn english men but now a seven year's slave
yea has honourable worship is within but he hath they godly minister or two with him and likewise leach
yee may not see his worshiped now
with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fairest state in his native land
on the table and token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind stood a large puer tankard at the bottom of which had hester or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draft of ale
little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering fronts piece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breast plate
mother cried she i see you here look look
and truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it
pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and imitator attempt at shrubbery
but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the aport to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening
there were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mister blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that ha mythological personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a bull
pearl seeing the rose bushes began to cry for our red rose and would not be pacified
he wore blue silk stockings bloom knee pans with gold buckles a blue ruffled waist and a jacket of bright blue braided with gold
his hat had a peaked crown in a flat brim and around the brim with a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved
instead of shoes the old man wore boots with turn over tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold bid
for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of owes in which they lived
when they were outside un simply lathed the door and started up the path
no one would disturb their little house even if any one came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
at the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the gil cans the path divided
he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbour
all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unc and ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket
then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of doctor piped
uncocked at the door of the house and a chubby pleasant faced woman dressed all them blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile
i am my dear and all strangers are welcomed to my home
we have come from a fire lonely a place than this o lone mere place
and you must be ojo the unlucky she added
oo had never eaten such a fine meal and all his life
we are travelling replied ojo and we stop at your house just arst in refresh ourselves
the woman seemed thoughtful
at one then stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row all bubbling and steaming at a great rate
it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment i am pleased to say it is nearly done you see i am making it for my good wife mara lot who wants to you some of it for a purpose of her own
you must know said mara lot when they were all seated together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mum bey the witch who used to leave in the country of the gil cans to the north of here
the first lot we tested on our glass hat which not only began to live but has lived ever since
i think the next glass cat and magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and may prove of some used to us
i'm afraid i don't know much about the land devised
you see i've lived all my life without monkey the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything
that is one reason you are ojo the unlucky said the woman in sympathetic tone
i think i must show you my patchwork girl said mara lot laughing at the boys astonishment as she is rather difficult to explain
but first i will tell you that for many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cope the meals and wash the dishes
yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose
a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and collars of cloth all neatly so together
sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up
when i found it i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from ty to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are
at the emerald city where our princess os lives green is the popular color
i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors
o jal examined this curious contrivance with wonder
margolotte had first made the girl's formed from the patch were quilted and then she had dressed it with the patch work skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same gay material throughout
the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her
the hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck and several neat braids
gold is the most common metal in the land of oz and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable
no i forgot on about to brains exclaimed the woman
well that may be true agreed margot but on the contrary a servant with too much brains assured to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work
she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles
i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in a servant
she ran to her husband side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire
their contents had all a boiled away leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder
very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it altogether in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon
no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
odo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
he selected a small gold bottle with a pepper box top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes
most people talk too much so it is a relief to find one who talks too little
i'm not allowed to perform magic except for my own amusement he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe where a cookin stem and began to smoke
there wasson of oz who used to be a humbug and new no mick at all has been taking lessons of glinda and i told he is getting to be a pretty good wizard but he is nearly the assistant of the great sorceress
it truly is asserted the magician
i now use them as ornamental statuary in my garden
dear me what a chatterbox are getting to be remarked the magician who was pleased with the compliment
asked the voice in scornful accents
the grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest
the edict of milan the great charter of toleration had confirmed to each individual of the roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion
but this inestimable privilege was soon violated with a knowledge of truth the emperor imbibed the maxims of persecution and the sex which dissented from the catholics church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of christianity
constantine easily believed that the heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation
some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of diocletian and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity
they asserted with confidence and almost of exultation that the apostolical succession was interrupted that all the bishops of europe and asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism and that the prerogatives of the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the african believers who alone had preserved in violet the integrity of their faith and discipline
bishops virgins and even spotless infants were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance before they could be admitted to the communion of the dons
proscribe by the civil ecclesiastical powers of the empire the dons still maintained in some provinces particularly ino media their superior numbers and four hundreds bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate
since the period of our tale the active spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements though none but the hunter or the savage is ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses
the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had dispersed the mists and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest when the travellers resumed their journey
after proceeding a few miles the progress of haki who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters
distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinions of chingachgook were frequent and earnest
yet here we within a short range of the scars and not a sign of a trail have we crossed
let us retrace our steps and examine as we go with keen or eyes
ching gutch book had caught the look and motioning with his hand he bade him speak
the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed
it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding
see said uncas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone toward the forest
if a rock or rivulet or bit of earth harder than common severed the links of the clue they followed the true ey of the scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary
extinguished brands were lying around a springing the awful of a dear were scattered about the place and the trees bore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses
a circle of a few hundred feet and circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
the examination however resulted in no discovery
the whole party crowded to the spot where uncas pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist alluvium
run back uncas and bring me the size of the singer's foot
notwithstanding the high resolution of hawkeye he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur
in his return to the camp his acute and practised intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of balum's asked to speak he was somewhat sceptical on the subject of a bears singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs
there was something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
the ingenious hawkeye who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well known voice replied
can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the truth began to dawn upon him
come come returned hawkeye on casing his honestest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion you may see a skin which if it be not as white has one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven in the sun have not bestowed now let us to business
the young man is in bondage and much i fear his death is decreed
i greatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and i have sought a goodly him can you lead me to him
the task will not be difficult returned david hesitating though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase that mitigate his unhappy fortunes
the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very center of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
four or five the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas wary but close observers of the manner of their captive
delivered in a strong tone of assent announced the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an exhibition of weakness and an enemy so long hated and so much feared
they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter
but the bare instead of obeying maintain of the seated had taken and growled
the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hin he received they must stand further off
then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place
it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful wits
the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain me were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and the singer as as good as nothing
the delawares o children of the tortoise and they outstripped the deer
uncas who had already approached the door and readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
but hak eye who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself into his companion
so uncas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
well what can't be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention
as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions
my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy in love return david a little nettle that so directed an attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
if you are not then knocked on the head your being anon composer will protect you and you'll then have a good reasons to expect to die in your bed
s chuse for yourself to make a rush or terry here
bravely and generously as he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service
keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practice myself as one without across a blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
god bless you friend i do believe your sent has not greatly wrong when the matter as duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts in the force of temptation
the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the others features is he afraid
will the herons here his groans
the mohican started on his feet and shook a shaggy covering as though the animal he counter fitted was about to make some desperate effort
he had no occasioned to delay for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
uncas cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrolled the agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
without his scrap books his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely corrected
i was absent rather more than an hour
the only duplicate which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion
the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers
the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together
they alternate was that someone passing observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair will i made a most careful examination of the room
a broken tip of lad was lying there also
not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black du or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it
above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly u discreetly
to the best of my belief they were rolled up
did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
i was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door open
so it seems to me
now mister solmes at your supposals
above were three students one on each story
then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his net crane he looked into the room
there is no opening except the one paining said our learned guide
i am afraid there are no signs here said he
one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day
you left him in a chair you say which chair by the window there
the man entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central table
as a matter of fact he could not said sums for i entered by the side door
how long would take him to do that using every possible contraction a quarter an hour or not less
then he tossed it down and seized the next
he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
mister palms was someone overwhelmed by this flood of information
cums held out a small chip with the letters and n and the space of clear wood after them you see
watson i have always done you and injustice there are others
i was hoping that if the paper i which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polish surface no i see nothing
as homes drew the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and in alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
hm turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor hallo what is this
holes hat it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light
what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
i understand you to say that there are three students who use this stare and are in the habit of passing your door yes there are
and they are all in for this examination yes
one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
let us see the suspicions i will look after the proofs
my scholar has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
the top floor belongs to miles mc clan
i dare not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely
he was still suffering from the sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life
but have occasionally d the same thing at other times
did you look at these papers on the table
how came you to leave the key in the door
anyone the room could get out yes sir
i really don't thinking knew much about at mister holmes
only for a minute or so
oh i would not venture to say sir
you haven't seen any of them no sir
it was the indian whose dark clad appeared suddenly upon his blind
he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
the set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
no names please said holmes as we knocked at gil christ door
of course he did not realize that it was i who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances run her suspicious
that is very important said holes
you don't seem to realize the position
tomorrow was the examination
i cannot be allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced
it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action
i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings good by
when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
the fowl mouse fellow at the top
he is the one with the worst record
why banister the servant what's his game in the matter
he impressed me is being a perfectly honest man
my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged hiss shoulders in half humorous resignation
no good my dear watson
i think so you have formed a conclusion
yes my dear watson i have solve the mystery
look at that he held out his hand
on the palm were three little pyramids of black due clay
and one more this morning
in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship
he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched think heaven that you have come
you know him i think so
if this matter is not to become publicly must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court marshal
no sir certainly not
there was no man sir
his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon banister in the farther corner
just close the door said holes
we want to know mister gil christ how you an honourable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday
for a moment gil christ with upraised hand tried to control his writhing features
come come said holmes kindly it is human to air and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal
well well don't trouble to answer listen and see that i do you know injustice
he could examine the papers in his own office
the indian i also thought nothing of
when i approached your room i examined the window
no one less than that would have a chance
i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side tablet
he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are where with several sharp spikes
no harm would have been done had had not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
he put his shoes on the table
gloves said the young man
suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
have i told the truth mister gil grist
i have a letter here mister sums which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night
it will be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out
it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know
if mister solmes saw them the game was up
in the debate between the signor societies her defense of the fifteenth amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not averse to charleston or new orleans
john taylor who had supported her few college was interested in cotton
better go he had counsel sententiously
might learn something useful down there
but john is no society just elementary work
then looking up toms county
fi some crust wells there big plantations raided it two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
some others too b cotton county
you ought to know john if i teach negroes i'll scarcely see much of people in my own class
at any rate i say go
here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused odours and bodily perspiration was to her at times unbearable
she wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies in reforms
so for the hundredth time she was thinking to day as she walked alone up the laying back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms
cut she paused
she had almost forgotten that it was here within touch in sight
the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her stretching a white to the northwards
there might be a bitter for trey here and there but most of this place was such desperate prose
her regards shifted to the green stalks and leaves again and she started to move away
cotton is a wonderful thing is it not boys she said rather primly
miss taylor did not know much about cotton but at least one more remarked seem called for
don't know well of all things inwardly commented miss taylor lit her reborn cotton and oh well as much as to ask was the use she turned again to go
i suppose go it's too early for them then came the explosion
goo was don't grow on the tops advise but on the ground on the roots like yams is that's so
the golden fleece it's the silver fleece he hearkened
sometime you tell me please won't you
now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even that she had been talking just talking there were no persons in the conversation just things one thing cotton
the honourable charles smiths miss sarah's brother was walking swiftly up tow from mister easter le's wall street office and his face was pale
at last the cotton combine was to all appearances an assured facts and he was slated for the senate
why should he not be as other men
she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others
as she awaited her guest she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and as quietude for her social functions were few to night there were she checked them off on her fingers sir james cryin the rich english manufacturer and lady cryin mister and missus van pool mister harry cress well and his sister john taylor and his sister and mister charles smiths whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be you dined a stay senator from new jersey a selection of guest that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of cotton interests earlier in the day
missus grey had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mo vividly their cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith
she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister crewe express himself so cordially as approving of negro education
do believe in some education asked mary taylor
i believing the training of people to the hast capacity the englishman here heartily second at him
but cruell added significantly capacity differs enormously between races
the bandar pools were sure this and the englishman instanced india became quite eloquent missus grey was mystify but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversations seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharper scrutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
fs aimee heroic added crest well avoiding his sister's eyes
but we're not a exactly welcome
mary taylor however related the tale of z to missus gryce private ear later
fortunately said mister van fl northers and southerners all raving at a bellow mutual understanding on most of these matters
he knew the silver fleece his ensor's must be ruined
it was the first great sorrow his life it was not so much the loss of the cotton itself but the phantasy the hopes the dreams built around it
ah the swamp the cruel swamp
the revelation of his love lighted and bright and slowly till it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder
he panted to know if she too knew or new and cared not or cared and knew not
she was so strange in human a creature
the world was water veiled and mists
then of a sudden that midday the sun shot out hot and still no breth of air stirred the sky was like lu steel the earth steam
where was the use of imagining
the lagoon had been level with the dyes a wee togo and now
perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly
he splashed and stamped along farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
then he looked down the lagoon was dry
he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of all of green thick tall wet and willowy
the squares of cotton sharp edged heavy were would just about to burst of bulls
or one long moment he paused stupid a gate with utter amazement v leaned dizzily against a tree
he gazed about perplexed astonished
here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work in pain some one had da c now from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by long and crooked way thus allowing it to empty directly
he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost sorr
the years of the days of her dying were ten
the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
up in the sick rooms or lay on the little white bed
the ned and webb of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumbs speechless terror against some mighty grasping that stow for her life was gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned
for while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at son and bird and tree
she rose with the fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forward wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
she had been borne within its bars within his bor as she had lived and groan and within its border she had met her love
on she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island low the cotton lay before her
the chair was empty but he knew
he darted through the trees and paused a tall man strongly but slimily made
it is a very final place of red brick softened by a pale powdery lichen which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bringing the red brick in terms of friendly companionship with a limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables the windows and the door place
but the windows are patched with wooden pains and the door i think is like the gate it is never opened
for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shedding with a sonorous bang behind the liveried lackey who had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pear
a large open fireplace with rusty dogs in it and a bearer boarded floor at the far end fleeces of wolves stacked up in the middle of the floor some empty corn bags
and what through the left hand window
several clots horses a pillion a spinning wheele and an old box white open and stuffed full of colored rags
at the edge of this box their lies a great wooden all which so far as mutilation is concern bears a strong resemblance to the finest greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
the history of the house is plain now
but there is always of stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beams and making sparkles among the wet straw and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cow shed and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow build ducks who are seizing the opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it is possible
where the great barn doors are thrown wide open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendence of mister goby the widow otherwise saddler who entertains them with a latest traddles and gossip
hetty sorrel often took the opportunity when her a's back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished services for the oak table was usually turned up like a screen and was more for ornament than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round put dishes there were ranged on the shelves above the long deal dinner table or in the hobbs of the great which always shone like jasper
do not suppose however that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish and her appearance she was a good looking woman not more than eight and thirty a fair complexion and sandy hair well shapen lightfooted
the family like this between her and her niece din mors with a contrast between her keenness and dinas seraphic gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a martha and mary
her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a damsel came with ayr shot seemed to take up an unfinished lecture as a barrel organ takes up a tune precisely at the point where it had left off
the fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the widows and why consequently missus poyser should scold molly the housemaid with unusual severity
towel appearance molly had got through her after in her work in an exemplary manner had cleans herself with great dispatch and now came to ask submissively if she should sit down to her spinning t milking time
spinning indeed
i never knew your equals for gallows ness
who taught you d scrub up floor i should like to know
comb the wool for the wows indeed
that's what you'd like to be doing is it
that's the way with you that's the row you'd all like to go hadad longs to ruin
mister o le's indeed
you are a rare and p sitting down to your work a little while after its time to put by
money my irons tit told these put it down to warm
cold is it my darling bless your sweet face
she's going to put the ironing things away
money i did like to do into the barn to tammy to see the wid od
no no no totty had get her feet wet said missus poyser carrying away her iron
did ever anybody see the like screamed missus poyser running towards the table when her eye had fallen on the blue stream
totty however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run and an amount of fat on the nap of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig
and she was very found of you too aunt rachel
i often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way
when shee had that ban illness and i was only eleven years old she used to say you'll have a friend on earth in your aunt rachel if i am taken from you for she has a kind heart and i'm sure i've found it so
and there's linen in the house as i could well spare you for i got lots a sheeting and table clothing and towing isn't made up
but not more than what's in the bible and said dinna
n dear and you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work in their families
we can all be servants of god wherever our lot is cast but he gives us different sorts of work according as he fits us for it and calls us to it
i can no more help spending my life and trying to do what i can for the souls of others then you could help running if you heard little totty crying at the other end of the house the voice would go to your heart you would think the dear child was in trouble's and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort her
i've strong assurance that no evil will haven't you and my uncle in the children for anything i have done
i didn't preach without direction
direction
i a a common patience with you
by this time the two gentleman had reached the palings and had got down from their horses it was plaining they meant to come in
said mister irwine with his stately cordiality
oh sir don't mention it said missus poyser
i delight in your kitchen
poyser is not at home missie
said captain dy thorn sitting himself where he could see along the short passage to the open derry door
no sir he isn't he's gone to rossiter to see mister west the factor about the wall
but there's father and barne sir if he'd be of any use
no thank you i'll just look at the whelps and leave a message about them with your shepherd
i must come another day and see your husband i want to have a consultation with him about horses
for if is anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute
oh sir said missus poyser rather alarmed you wouldn't like it at all
but you know more about that that i do sir
i think i should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place
i knows farm is in better order than any other within ten miles of us and as for the kitchen he added smiling i don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it
by the bye i've never seen your dairy you must see your dy missus poyser
this missus poyser said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her mok pans and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy
oh i've no doubt it's in capital order
the paris plant like that at the crystal palace was a temporary exhibit
the london plat was less temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings in the vicinity of holborn by ada
there messrs johnson and hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told
the dynamo electric machine tho small was robust for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine seventeen years
owing to his insistence on low pressure directs current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current
why if we arctic station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city
there seems no good reason for believing that it will change
bad as the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them he is idiot sin chronically opposed to loose and wasteful methods to plans of empire that neglected the poor at the gate
everything he has done has been aimed that the conservation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously
it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could a charge storage batteries all of which are easily within thea ability of the dire current
but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a farmhouse the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and is ideal
edison was intolerant of sham and shady and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope test tube and galvanometer
unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governed regulated the those eva for his dynamo and lamp edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light
mister edison was a leader far ahead of the time
he obtained the desired speed and load with a friction break also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator to verify it
then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running and mister edison inform me that as a ran engine started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times
edison had installed his historic first great central station system in new york on the multi ar system covered by his feeder and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight two wire system throughout of the tree kind
he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact district of large cities
the strong position held by the edison's system under the strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting
it was specially suited for a trial plat also in the early days when a yield of sixth or eight lamps to the horse power was consider subject for congratulation
the street conductors were of the overhead whole line construction aw installed by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build an equip central stations
meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wire system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent and vents at practically the same time
i think he was perhaps more appreciative that i was of the discipline of the edison construction de pardon and fun it would be well for us to wait until the morning the fourth before we started up
but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country
they were later used as reserved machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of at sonia but they remained in practically as good condition as one installed in eighteen eighty three
the ark lamp installed outside a customers premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident
ev son held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gasp or water and he proceeded to develop a meter
there was infinite scepticism around him on the subjects and while other inventors were also giving the subject bare thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact pointed use could not be brought to accurate registration
hence the edison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
the principle employed in the edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance
associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
the standard edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a months to the meter room of the central station company for examination another set being substituted
in december eighteen eighty eight mister w j jenks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other
the others having been in operation too short a time to show definite results although they also w quickly to a divide and basis
in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter
the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century
he weighed and rew the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
the problem was solved
we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part
we had maders in which there were two bottles of liquid
here she would stay comforted and soothe among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turner the gardener who since polly's first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
every chance she could steal after practise hours were over and after the clamorous ams of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
then dear said missus whitney you must be kind int to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear at no longer
if she could only see phronsie for just one moment
oh she's always at the piano said van she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
at this the bundle open suddenly and out it popped phronsie
but polly couldn't speak and of jasper hadn't caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool phronsie and all
asked phronsie with her little face close to polly's own
now you'll stay cried v say polly won't you
oh you are the dearest and best mister king i ever saw but how did you make mammy let her come
isn't he splendid cried jasper an intense pride swelling up father knew how to do it
there there he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head
i know gasped polly controlling her sobs i won't only i can't thank you
asked phronsie in intense interests slipping down out of polly's arms and crowding up close to jasper side
yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truly phronsie
oh no chapter i must go by my very own self
there jap you've caught it laughed percy while the others screamed at the side of jasper's face
don't mind it polly whispered jasper twasn't her fault
dear me ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost amazement and such a time as i've had to get her here too
how did her mother ever let her go
she asked impulsively i didn't believe you could persuade her father
i didn't have any fears if i worked at rightly said the old gentleman complacently
he cried and high dudgeon just as if he owned the whole of the peers and could dispose that them all to sooth is fancy
and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time
at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously
it is sixteen years since john berks and died
his wife now lies beside him and the light shaft that marks their graves gleams across the heat fields
from the norwegian graveyard one looks al over a vast checker board marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light
from the graveyards gate one can count a dozen gaily painted farmhouses the gilded weather veins on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
the air and the earths curiously mated and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other
he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy grey eyes deeply set under a serious brow
that's not much of a job for an athlete here i've been to town and back
alexander that's you sleep l
she gathered up her reins
please wait for me marie an il coaxed
i never see loose sighed over here
how brown you've got since you came home i wish i had an adele to mow my orchards
i get wet to my knees when i go down to pick cherries
indeed he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it
they think your proud because you've been away to school or something
there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail
on either side of the road for a mile before y reached the foot of the hill stood tall o sage or inched jes their glossy green mocking off the yellow fields
anyone thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra bergs and
there is even a white row of beehives and the orchard under the walnut trees
frank redd english slowly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he grew
marie sighed
a brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky
the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
that invitation decided her
oh but i'm glad to get this place mode
just smell the wild roses they are always so spicy after a rain
we never had so many of them in here before
i suppose it's the wet season will you have to cut them to
i suppose that's the wet decent to then
if exciting to see everything growing so fast and to get the grass cut
art you splashed look up a spider weeps all over the grass
in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pale and he began to swing his sigh with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learn
mari picked cherries and saying softly to herself stripping one glittering branch after another shivering when she thought a shower of raindrops on her neck and hair
and amyl mow his way slowly down toward the jerry trees
that summer the reins had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than gabatha and his man could do to keep up with the corn the orchards was a neglected wilderness
i don't know all at them but i know linens are
if i feel that way i feel that way
he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit long ivory coloured berries tipped with main pink like white coral that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through
he dropped a handful into her lap
yes don't you
oh ever so match only you seems kind of stay it and school teacher
when she used to tell me about him or always wondered whether she wasn't a little love with him
it would serve you all right if she walked off with karl
i liked to talk to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there
oh ami
surely you are not thinking of going off there
marie's face fell under his brooding gaze
i'm sure alexander hopes you will stay on here she murmured
i don't m to stand around and look on
i want to be doing something on my own account
sometimes i don't want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the four corners of the divide together he threw out his arms and brought it back with a jerk so like g a tablecloth
i get tired of seeing man and horses going up and down up and down
i wish you weren't so restless and didn't give so worked up over things she said sadly
thank you he returned shortly
and you never used to be cross to me
i can't play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly that's what you miss marie
but amal if i understand then are good times are over we can never do nice things together any more
and anyhow there's nothing too understand
that won last it will go away and things will be just as they used to
i pray for you but that's not the same as if you pray yourself
i can't pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i wal pray not to have them not if i'm damned for it
then all our good times are over
saturday august fifteenth the sea and broken all round no land in sight
the horizon seems extremely distant
all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feelings out of him but now that i am well his nature has resumed its sway
you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye anxious
one might be would less reason th now
i am not complaining that the rate is slow but that the seat is so wide
we are rising time and the fact is i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft
he called the sea upon and i long wage ticking a little sail
therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects
i take this is my answer and i leave the professor tobe his lips with impatience
sunday august sixteenth
nothing knew whether unchanged the wind freshens
but there seemed no reason of fear
the shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
truly the sea is of infinite w
it must be as wide as the mediterranean or the atlantic and why not
these thoughts agitated me all day in my imaginations scarcely calm down after several hours sleeve
i shudder as i recall these monsters to my remembrance
i saw at the hamburgh museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length
i suppose professor lead brack was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pick his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side
tuesday august eighteenth
daring his watch i slept
two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me
the raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms
there is awa a well cried the professor
fight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they willed around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of expressed trades
two monsters only re creating all this commotion and be for my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world
i could distinguish the eye of the it thei assume glowing like a red hot co and as large as a man's head
its jaw is enormous and according the naturalist it is armed with no less than wine hundreds and eighty two teeth
those huge creatures attack each other with a greatest animosity
suddenly the it thesaurus and the please source disappear below leaving a warp eddying in the water
as for the if thesaurus h he returned whose summer in cavern
the roarings become lost in the distance
the weather if we may use the term will change before lot
the atmosphere charged with vapors pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of sailing waters
the electric light can scarcely penetrate through the dense curtain which is dropped over the theatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged
the air is heavy the sea is calm
from time the time a fleecy tuft of miss we yet some gleaming light left upon it drops down upon the dense floor of grey and loses itself in the opaque an impenetrable mass
the atmosphere as evidently charged and surcharged with electricity
the wind never lolls but to acquire increase strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms
there's a heavy storm coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon
those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea
on the mast already i see the light play of lamon saint ev's fire the outstretched sill catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead
but if we have now ceased to advance why d weet leave that sail loose which at the first shock of a tempest may capsize us in a moment
that will be the safest no no never
the piled up vapours contents into water and the air put ino violent action to supply the bac him left by the condensation of the mist rouses itself into a world wind
har stairs night
from the under surface of the clouds there are continual a missions of lurid light electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules the gashes elements of the air needed to be slaked with moisture for innumerable columns of water rushed upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam
i referred of the thermometer it indicates a figure is obliterated
is the atmosphere condition having once reached density to become final
the raft bears on still to the south east
at noon the violence of the stormy doubles
each of us is lashed is some part of the raft
the waves rise above our heads
they seem to be we are lost but i am not sure
he nods his consent
the far ball half of it why half azure blue and the size of the ten in shell moved solely about the raft but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind
here it comes there it glides now it is up the ragged stump of the mast that's it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just skins the powder magazine horrible
we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches hans who fixes his blue eye upon its steadily it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it
a suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air it enters the throat it fills the lungs
we suffer stifling pains
and how odd the directions were look
poor alice
it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with the pair white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along and a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess
oh what she be savage if i'd kept her waiting
alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is today
and yesterday thinks went u just as usual
i wonder if i've been changed in the night
i almost take i can remember feeling a little different
i'll try if i know all the things i used to know
i shall never get to twenty at that rate
how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws
no i've made it my mind about it if im mae i'll stay down here
it'll be no use they're putting their heads down and saying come up again dear
i am so very tired of being all alone here
and i declare it's too bad that it is
i wish i hadn't cried so much said alice as she swim about trying to find her way out
i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears
that will be a queer thing to be sure
i am very tired a swimming about here o mouse
cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
we won't talk about her any more if he'd rather not we indeed
we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american stream line him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther unless me make him talk as he would talk to day to americans
let us begin with that his commons glass
the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved the most difficult one and at times became oppressive
it was written in latin
the word had to be condensed
a words should now be set about the origin of luther's commentary anglicans
much later when a friend of his was preparing addition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine mliss for instance and
in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther are addressed his students and the course of galatians and roar prepared the manuscript for the printer
it presents like no other of luthers writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christ merits alone
but the essence of luther's lectures is there
the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us power to serve and to do luke too
the word of our god shall stand for ever
in every way they sought to undermine authority of saint paul
they said to the galatians you have no right to think highly of paul
he was the last to turned a christ
poking later in his beneath us
indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
do you suppose that god for the sake of a few lutheran heretics would dis ow his entire church
against these boasting false apostles paul boldly defense his apostolic authority and ministry
as the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person so the minister of christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men
pul takes pride in his ministry not to his own phrase but to the praise of god
paul and apostle not of men et cetera
either he calls ministers to the agency of men or i calls them directly as he called the prophets and apostles
paul declares that the false apostles were call their sent neither by men nor by man
the most they could claim is that they were sent by others
he mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by god
the call was not to be taken lightly
for person to possess knowledge is not enough
is spoils one's best work
when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his coal
i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
i knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught sop frey instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
this is no sinful pride it is wholly pride
and god the father who raised him from the dead
the close superfluous on first sight
these perverts of the rightness of christ resist the father and the sun and the works of them both
in this whole epistle of pall treats of the resurrection of christ
by his resurrection christ w the victory over law sin flesh whirl devil death hell and every evil
first two
and all the breth room which are with me
this you go far and shutting the mouse of the false of postals
although the brethren with me are not apostles like myself yet they all of one mind with me think right and teach as i do
they do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominate they go over the questions are
wid d they not invade the catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to god this princes bishops and doctors as we have them by the help of god
we look for that reward which i hath not seen nor ear heard neither hath entered into the heart of man
not all the galatians had become perverted
these means cannot be continent
they remained divine regardless of men's opinion
wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church even though antichrist rings there
so much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the apostle verse three
grace be to you in peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
the terms of grace and peace are common terms with paul and are now pretty well understood
the greeting of the apostles refreshing
grace involves the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
the world brands this a pernicious doctrine
experience proofs this
however the grace and piece of god will
men should not speculate about the nature of god
was it not enough to say from god the father
to do so as to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure him to comprehend is infinite majesty
he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him
embrace him and forget about the nature of god
did not christ himself say i am the way and the truth in the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
when you argue about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like
we are to hear christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher
at the same time paul confirms are creed that christ is very god
that christ is very god is apparent in that paul scribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to the spens grace and peace
to bestow peace and grace lies in the province of god who alone c create these blessings the angels cannot
otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and peace from our lord jesus christ
the arians took cries for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth
mohammed also speedily of christ
pul sticks to his theme
he never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle
not gold or silver or partial lambs or an angel but himself what for
not for a crown were a kingdom or a goodness before o sins
under score these words for there are full of comfort for sore consciences
how may we obtain remission of our sins
poysers the man who his named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for a since
since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts
this sentence also to finds our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin
the greatness of the ransom christ son of god indicates this
the vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins
but we are careless we make light of sin
we think the by some little work or merit we can dismiss
this passage then theres out the fact that all men are sold manders sin
this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that san as a small matter easily taken care of by good works but we must present oursel u to god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sins
this attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
on the other hand we are not to regard them is so terrible that we must despair
he passes abruptly from persons the ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to men from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subjects an objects first and final causes and as dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a floods of sense
the influence which the tus has exercised upon pity is due hartly to a misunderstanding
in the supposed depths of this dia lo the neal platonists found hidden meanings in connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly corrector sic in him his effort realize in connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
there isle danger of the modern cats on the tus falling unto the absurdities of the new platonists
in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
the fancies of the new platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevail widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day
but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spirit they are opposed to him
we do not know how play to would have arranged his own dials or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the too trilogy which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
the di lop is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this t the heavily bodies and with man only as one among the animals
but he has not as yet the find this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great and impiety in winking furies of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
with hues he acknowledges the perpetual flocks like an exaggerate he assert the predominance of mine although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pierian he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
many if not all the elements of the pre socratic philosophy are included in the times
it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
the style and plan of the peneus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dials
but plato has not the same myer over his instrument which he exhibits in the feats or symposia
nothing can exceeded the beauty you or are tot introduction in which his using words after his accustomed manner
but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
he could wise in one style but not in another in the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the timaeus of plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of lucretius
there is a want of flow and often a defects of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of opposition and more of repetition then occurs in plato's earlier writings
plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art
sureties begins to tens with a summary of the republick
and now he desires to see the ideal state set in motion he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle
and therefore to you i turned toms citizen of locris who are at once a philosopher in a statesmen and to you critias whom all athenians know to be similarly accomplished and to hermocrates who is also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse

but already at pointing economic evolution far an dating the emergence of the lady specialized consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had began to work out in a mor or less elaborate system
the utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a diva of growth
such consumption as false to the women is nearly incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labor and not a consumption erected to their own comfort and fulness of life
with the further advance and culture this tab may changed into simple custom of a mor oral less rigorous characters but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it bea abu or a large to conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class
under the taboo certain victuals and more particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the us of the superior class
drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tent in their turn to become unify as being a mark at the second remove of the superior states of those who are able to afford the indulgence
it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into every day speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
with many qualifications with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradual weakened the general rue is fell to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters
the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and house old paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rue but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial
the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the later development that they do not continue to be the soul motives
there is a moralist elaborate system of ranking grates
this differentiation is further by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lessen of substance in their own right so that some of them must scarce let all others only partially to be rated as vicarious consumers
so many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification
many of these again and also many of the other aristocracy of lest degree having turned attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive group of icarius consumer in the persons of their wives and children their servants retainers et cetera
the wearing of uniforms o liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible
the wearers of uniforms and liveries may be recall divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble
that the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked
so those offices which are by wright the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be class as ostensibly predatory employments
whenever as in these cases the menial service in question has to do directly with a primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a effected honorific characters
the livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it
in a general way though not wholly nor consistently these two groups coincide
the dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in the later development of the institution when the member of persons by whom these duties are customarily performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last
but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of ry cars leisure in consumption devolve upon the wife alone
in the communities of the western culture this point is at present found among the lower middle class
if beauty of comfort is achieved and it is morals for tutor circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that command themselves through the great economical or of v wasted effort
the man of the household also cain do something in this direction and indeedy commonly does that with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the s limps the man and presently also the children virtual is seized to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the soule exponent of the households pecuniary decency
very much of squalor and discomfit will be endued before the last trinket or the last pretence of pecuniary decencies put away
there is no class and no country that as yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need
the question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to effect
each will therefore serve about equally well during the earner stages of social growth
the modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line
it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
it is also noticeable that the so ca ability consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest
consumption becomes a larger element in the stander of living in the city than in the country
among the country population its places to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighbourhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute
the result is a great mobility of the labor employing printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well define inconsiderable body of workmen
under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset
but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came told the rank firma above wasteful consumption of goods both as a directed exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the course peaceable culture
are the circumstance permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favour upon productive of efficiency and on whatever is of human use
a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is affected by resort to make believe men in intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations have founded with some specious object of emulation and boded in their official stand title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the talk is may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic
the sailing features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods are of services or human life rans the obvious implication that in order to effectually men the consume as good thame it must be an expenditure of superfluities
as us in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation
the us of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this cannon of conspicuous waste
but it is another grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of every day life implies deprecation of what is characterized th s wasteful
in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous wast at such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
an article may be useful and wasteful both and its slaty to consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most faring proportions

why are we to be denied each other's society
why are we to be divided
surely it must be because we're in danger of loving each other too well of losing sight of the creator and idolatry of the creature

cori in clergyman's daughter was always in a minority of one in our house of violent descent in radicalism
her feeble health gave her her yielding manner for she could never oppose anyone without gathering up all her strength for the struggle

and so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent radicals and dissenters into which twenty years ago the little quiet resolute clergyman's daughter was received and by whom she was truly loved and honored
january and february of eighteen thirty seven had passed away and still there was no reply from selby
i am not depreciating it when i say that in these times it is not rare
but it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you can sett your own happiness
you will say that a woman has no need of such a caution there can be no peril in it for her
the more she is engaged in her proper duties the less leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation
to those duties you have not yet been called and when you are you will be less eager for celebrity
but do not suppose that i disparage the gift which you possess nor that i would discard you from exercising it i only exhort you so to think of it and so to use it as to render it conducive to your own permanent good

i have not ventured to hope for such a reply so considerate in its tone so noble in its spirit
i know the first letter i wrote to you was all senseless trash from beginning to end but i am not altogether the idle dreaming being it would seem to denote
i thought it therefore my duty when i left school to become a governess
in the evenings i confess i do think but i never trouble any one else with my thoughts
i carefully avoid any appearance of preoccupation and eccentricity which might lead those i live amongst to suspect the nature of my pursuits
i don't always succeeded for sometimes when i'm teaching or sewing i would rather be reading a writing but i try to deny myself and my father's approbation amply rewarded me for the privation
again i thank you this incident i suppose will be renewed no more if i live to be an old women i shall remember at thirty years hence as a bright dream
p s price sir excuse me for writing to you a second time i could not help writing partly to tell you how thankful i am for your kindness and partly to let you know that your if vice shall not be wasted however sorrowfully and reluctantly it may be at first s followed ce be

the christmas holidays came and she and anne returned to the parsonage and to that happy home circle in which alone their natures expanded amongst all other people they shriveled ab more or less
indeed there were only one or two strangers who could be admitted among the sister is we producing the same results
she was gone out into the village on some errand when as she was descending the steep street her foot slipped on ice and she fell he was dark and no one saw her mischance till after a time her groans attracted the attention of a passer by
unfortunately the fracture could not be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at her house in a very doubtful and dangerous state
however remembering what you told me namely that you had commended the matter to a higher decision than ours and that you were resolved to submit with resignation to that decision whatever it might be i hold it my duty to yield also and to be silent and may be all for the best
after this disappointment i never dare reckon with certainty on the enjoyment of a pleasure again it seems as if some fatality stood between you and me

tabby had lived with them for ten or twelve years and was as charlotte expressed it one of the family
he refused at first to listen to the careful advice it was repugnant to his liberal nature
this decision was communicated to the girls
tabby had tended them in their childhood they and none other should tend her in her infirmity in age
at tea time they were sad and silent and the meal went away untouched by any of the three
she had another wight on her mind this christmas
but anne had began to suve just before the holidays and charlotte watched over her younger sisters with the jealous vigilance of some wild creature that changes her very nature if danger threatens her young
stung by anxiety for this little sister she upbraided miss w for her fancied indifference to an state of health
still her heart had received a shock in the perception of anne's delicacy allies holiday she watched over her with the longing fawn anxiety which a so full of sudden pangs of fear
i doubt whether branwell was maintaining himself at this time
to celebrate the arrival of her son sylvia gave a splendid supper to which she had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance
without saying it positively she made me understand that being herself and illustrious member of the republick of letters she was well aware that she was speaking to an insects
in order to please her i spoke to her of the abbey canty and i had occasion to quote two lines of that profound writer
madame corrected me with a patronizing air for my pronunciation of the word scare which means divided saying that it ought to be pronounced secure and she added that i ought to be very glad to have learned so much on the first day of my arrival in paris telling me that it would be an important day in my life
her face was in enigma for it inspired everyone with the warmest sympathy and yet if you examined it attentively there was not one beautiful feature she could not be call handsome but no one could have thought her ugly
sylvia was the adoration of france and her talent was the real support of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her especially of the plays of maro for without her his comedies would never have gone to posterity
sylvia did not think that her good conduct was a marit for she knew that she was virtuous only because herself love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority towards her theatrical sisters although satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue
two years before her death i saw her performed the characters of marianne in the comedy of maro and in spite of her age and declining health the illusion was complete
she was honourably buried in the church of saints aver without the slightest opposition from the venerable priest who far from sharing the anti christian and tolerance of the clergy and general said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good christian and that the earth was a common mother of all human beings as jesus christ had been the saviour of all mankind
you will forgive me dear reader if i have made you attend the funeral sylvia ten years before her death believe me i have no intention of performing a miracle you may console yourself with the idea that i shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor sylvia dies
i never had any family
i had a name i believe in my young days but i have forgotten it since i have been in service
i shall call you a spree
you to me a great honor
here go and get me change for a louis i have it sir
at your service sir
madame son besides can answer your inquiries
i see a quantity of chairs for higher at the rate of one sou men reading the newspaper under the shade of the trees girls and men breakfasting either alone more in company waiters who were rapidly going up and down a narrow staircase hidden under the foliage
i sit down in a small table a waiter comes immediately to inquire my wishes
i tell to give me some coffee if it is good
then turning towards me he says that i look like a foreigner and when i say that i am in italian he begins to speak to me of the court the city of the theatres and at last he offers to accompany me everywhere
i think him and take my leave
i address him in italian and he answers very wittily but his way of speaking makes me smile and i tell him why
my remark pleases him but i soon proved to him that it is not the rid way to speak however perfects may have been the language of that ancient rider
i see a crowd in one corner of the garden everybody standing still on looking up
is there not a meridian everywhere
yes but the meridian of the palais royal is the most exact
that is true bad del gree
all these honest persons are waiting their turn to get their snuff boxes filled
it is sold everywhere but for the last three weeks nobody will use any snuff but that sold at the save cat
is it better th anywhere else
but how did she manage to render it so fashionable
simply by stopping her carriage two or three times before the shop to have her snuff box filled and by saying aloud to the young girl who handed back the box that her snuff was the very best in paris
you are now in the only country in the world where wit can make a fortune by selling either a genuine or a false article in the first case it receives the welcome of intelligent and talented people and in the second fools are always ready to rewarded for silliness is truly a characteristic of the people here and however wonderful it may appear sills is the daughter of wit
let a man run and everybody will run after him the crowd will not stop unless the man is proved to be mad but to prove it is indeed the difficult task because we have a crowd of men who mad from their birth are still considered wise
it seems to me i replied that such approval such ratification of the opinion expressed by the king the princes of the blood et cetera is rather a proof of the affection felt for them by the nation for the french cary that affection to such an extent that they believe them infallible
when the king comes to paris everybody calls out fe the l roy
she introduced me to all her guests and gave me some particulars respecting everyone of them
what sir er i said to him and my fortunate enough to see you
he himself reside at the same passage in french and politely pointed out the parts in which he thought that i had improved on the original
for the first day sir i think that what you have done gives great hopes of you and without any doubt you will make rapid progress
i believe it sir and that is what i fear therefore the principal object of my visit here is to devote myself entirely to the study of the french language
i am a very unpleasant pupil always asking questions curious troublesome insatiable and even supposing that i could meet with the teacher i require i am afraid i am not rich enough to pay him
i reside in the ma grew d port
i will make you translate them into french and you needed not be afraid of my finding you insatiable
he had a good appetite c tela good story without laughing was celebrated for his witty res and his sociable manners but he spent his life at home seldom going out and seeing hardly anyone because he always had a pipe in his mouth and was surrounded by at least twenty cats with which he would amuse himself all day
his housekeeper had the management of everything she never allowed him to be in need of anything and she gave no account of his money which she kept altogether because he never asked her to render any accounts
on the sixth of april eighteen thirty the church of jesus christ of later day saints was formerly organized and thus took on a legal existence
its origin was small a germ an insignificant seed hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition
instead of but six regularly affiliated members and at most two score of adherents the organization numbers to day many hundred thousand souls
in place of a single hamlet in the smallest corner of which the members could have congregated there nil are aboute seventy stakes of zion and about seven hundred organized wards each ward and stake with its full compliment of officers and priest organizations
the practice of gathering its proselytes into one place prevents the building up and strengthening of foreign branches and inasmuch as extensive and strong organizations are seldom met with abroad very erroneous ideas exist concerning the strength of the church
nevertheless of the mustard seed amongst the smallest of all seeds has attained the proportions of a tree and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches the acorn is now in oak offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way for truth
their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation towards the evening sum not merely that the work of pros lighting should be carried on in the west but that the headquarters of the church should be there established
the book mormon had taught the people the true origin and destiny of the american indians and toward this dark skin remnant of a once mighty people the missionaries of mormonism early turned their eyes and with their eyes went their hearts and their hopes
it is notable that the indian tribes have jenny regarded the religion of the latter days saints with favor seeing in the book mormon striking agreement with their own traditions
the first well established seat of the church was in the pretty little town of courland ohio almost within sight of like erie in here soon rose the first temple of modern times
to the fervent latter a saint a temple is not simply e church building a house for religious assembly
soon thousands of converts had rented or purchased homes and misery independence jackson county being their center but from the first they were unpopular among the mysians
the lieutenant governor little burn w bogs afterward governor was a pronounced mormon hater and throughout the period of the troubles he men off his sympathy with the persecutors
their sufferings have never yet been fitly chronicled by human scribe
making their way across the river most of the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of clay county and afterward established themselves in called well county therein founding the city of far west
a small settlement had been founded by mormon families on shoal creek and here on the thirtieth of october eighteen thirty eight accompany of two hundred and forty fell upon the hapless settlers and butchered a score
be it said to the honour of some of the officers entrusted with a terrible commission that when they learnt its true significance they resign their authority rather than have anything to do with what they designated a cold blooded butcher
oh what a record to read what a picture to gaze upon how awful the fact
american schoolboys read with emotions of horror of the albigenses driven beaten and killed with a pale legate directing the butchery and of the foi hunted and hounded like beasts as the effective a royal decree and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate
who began the quarrel was at the mormons
as the able of the press comments against the brutality of the mysians i quote a paragraph from the quincy argus march sixteenth eighteen thirty nine
it will be observed that an organized mob aided by many of the civil and military officers of missouri with governor bogs at their head have been the prominent actors in this business incited to it appears against the mormons by political hatreds and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge
the army sound the people in poverty and left them in comparative wealth
but a word further concerning the expedition in general
it was through floors advice the be caned order the military expedition to utah ostensibly to install certain federal officials and to repress and alleged infantile rebellion which in fact had never come into existence but in reality to further the entreats of the secessions
moreover had the people been inclined to rebellion while greater opportunity could they have wished
already in north and a south were talk of wind on set up also a west
they knew no north no south no east no west they stood positively by the constitution and would of nothing to do in the bloody strife between brothers unless indeed they were summoned by the authority to which they had already once lery responded to furnish men and arms for the countries need
what the latter n sates call celestial marriage his characteristic of the church and is in very general practice but of soles marriage plurality of wives was an incident never an essential
we believe in a literal resurrection and an actual hereafter in which future state shall be recognized every sanctified an authorize relationship existing here on earth of parrot and child brother in sister husband and wife
it has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands to observe the customs and study the habits of more nations than one i yet to find the place and meet the people wearing with whom the purity of man and woman is held more precious than among them maligned mormons in the mountain valleys of the west
at the inception of borough marriage among the latter day saints there was no law national or state against its practice
in eighteen sixty two a law was enacted with a purpose of suppressing floral marriage and as had been predicted in the national senate payer to its passage it lay for many years a dead letter
federal judges and united states attorneys and utah who were not mormons nor lovers and wm ism refuse to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law because of its manifest injustice and inadequacy
this meant that for an allege mis demeanour for which congress prescribed a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and a fine of three hundred dollars a man might be imprison for life i for many terms of em's natural life did the quarts power to enforce its sentences extend so far and might be find millions of dollars
before this travesty on the administration of law could be brought before the court of last resort and there met with the reversal and rebuke it deserved men were imprisoned under sentence of many years duration
the people contested these measures one by one in the courts presenting in case after case the different phases of the subjects and urging the unconstitutional andy of the measure
then the church was disc operated and its property both real and personal confiscated and asiatic to the government of the united states and although that personal property was soon restored realestate of great value long lay in the hands of the courts receiver and the mormon church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property
and so the story of mormonism runs on its finally has not yet been written the current press presents continuously new stages of its progress new developments of its plan
main hol like alexander because he was an engineer
he had preconceived ideas about everything and his idea about americans was that they should be engineers on mechanics
it's tremendously well put on to
it's been on only two weeks and i've been half a dozen times already
do you know alexander maine hall looked with perplexity up into the top of the handsome and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger do you know i sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself

sir harry town mister partly alexander the american engineer
i say sir harry the little girls going famously to knight isn't she
you know i thought the dance of be conscious to night for the first time
west mere and i were back after the first act and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself
a little attack of nerves possibly
he was beginning to feel with keen interest in the slender baa afoot donkey girl who slipped in and out of the play singing like someone winding through a hilly field
one night when he and winifred was sitting together on the bridge he told her the things had happened while he was studying abroad that he was sorry for one thing in particular and he asked her whether she thought she ought to know about them
she considered for a moment demands no i think not though w i'm glad you ask me
after that it was easy to forget actually to forget
of course he reflected she always had that combination of something homely insensible and something utterly wild and daft
she must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to
from glad she's held her own since
after all we were awfully young
i shouldn't wonder if she could laugh about it with me now
hilda was very nice to him and he sat on the edge of his chair flushed with his conversational efforts and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar
they asked him to come to see them and chelsey and they spoke very tenderly of hilda
lamb wouldn't care a great deal about many of them i fancy
when bartle arrived at bedford square on sunday evening marie the pretty little french girl met him at the door and conducted him upstairs
i should never have asked you if molly had been here for i remember you don't like english cookery
i haven't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place i think this is
they are all sketches mead about the villa des day you see
those fellows are all very loyal even main hall
i've managed to save something every year and that with helping my three sisters now and then and tiding poor cousin mike over bad seasons
it's not particularly rare she said but some of it was my mothers
there was water chris soup and soul and a delightful omelet stuff with mushrooms and truffles and two small rare ducklings and arta chokes and a dry yellow ran wine of which bartle had always been very fond
there is nothing else that looked so jolly
thank you but i don't like it so well as this
have you been in peris much these late ears
there are few changes and the old quarter
don't i though i'm so sorry to hear it how did her son turn out
her hair is still like flax and her blue eyes are just like a babies and she has the same three freckles on her little nose and talks about going back to her bandon air
how jolly it was being young hilda
do you remember that first walk we took together in paris
come we'll have our coffee the other room and you can smoke
i think we did she answered to merrily
what she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs but just our youths
they were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money god give you a happy love
the strange woman and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply had frightened them both
bartle started when held a rang a little bell beside her dear me why did you do that
it was very jolly he murmured lazily as marie came in to take away the coffee
have i told you about my new play
when she finished alexander shook himself out of a reverie
nonsense of course i can't really singing except the way my mother and grandmother did before me
it's really too warm in this room to singing don't you feel it
alexander went over and opened the windowed for her
there just in front
he stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said it's soft and misty see how white the stars are
for a long time neither hilding nor bartle spoke
he felt a drummer run through the slender yellow figure in front of him
bartle leaned over her shoulder without touching her and whispered in her ear you are giving me a chance yes
alexander clenched the two hands at his sides
the stop at queen's tow the tedious passage up the mercy were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience
she blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs
alexander paced up and down the hallway buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat until she returned and took him up to hill his living room
the room was empty when he entered
alexander did not set down
i felted in my bones when i woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up
i thought it might be sister cater cousin mike would be happening along
she pushed him towards the big chair by the fire and sat down on the stool at the opposite side of the hearth her knees drawn up to her chin laughing like a happy little girl
when did you come bartle and how it it happen you haven't spoken a word
i got in about ten minutes ago
alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze
bartle bent lowered over the fire
she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head thrust forward like a catapult and leach
i'll do anything you wish me too bartle she said tremulously
i can't stamp seeing you miserable
he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
hild to watched him from the corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes it
but it's worse now it's unbearable
i get nothing but misery out of either
the world is all there just as it used to be but i can't get added any more
it was myself i was defying hilda
held face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been
but why didn't you tell me when you were here in the summer
alexander groan i meant to but somehow i couldn't
she pressed his hand gently and gratitude
won't you happy then at all
she closed her eyes and took a deep breath as if to drawin again the fragrance of those days
he moved uneasily and his chair created
yes yes she hurried pulling her hand gently away from him
please tell me one thing bartle at least tell me that you believe i thought i was making you happy
yes held i know that he said simply
i understand bartle i was wrong
but i didn't know you've only to tell me now
what i mean is that i want you to promise never to see me again no hatter how often i come no matter how heard i beg
keep away if you wish when if i ever followed you
alexander rose and shook himself angrily yes i know un cowardly
he took a roughly in his arms do know what i mean
h bartle what am i to do
i will ask the least imaginable but i must have something
i must know about you
the sight of you bartle to see you living and happy and successful can i never make you understand what that means to me
you see loving some one as i love you makes the whole world different
and then you came back not carrying very much but it made no difference
bartle bent over and took her in his arms kissing her mouth and her wet tired eyes
don't cry don't cry he whispered
with tortured each other enough for to night
chapter one origin
it engenders a whole world la peg for which red theft and a hell la peg grin for which red hunger
thus idle miss the mother
she has a son theft and a daughter hunger
what is slain
we have never understood this sort of objections
slang is odious
slang makes one shudder
who denyed that of course it does
when it is a question of probing a wound a golf a society since when has it been considered wrong to go too far to go to the bottom
we have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and at least a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted in fulfilled merits
why should were not explore everything and study everything
why should one halt on the way
nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang
now when has horror ever excluded study
since when has malady banished medicine
cam one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper the bat the scorpion the centipede the tula and one who which cast them back into their darkness saying oh how ugly that is
he would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize if act in humanity
what is slaying properly speaking
it is the language of wretchedness
we may be stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms which is one way of attenuating it we may be told that al trade professions it may be added all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence have their own slight
the painter who says my grinder the notary who says my skip the gutter the hair dresser who says my merely back the cobbler who says my cub tals slang
there is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the press uses
the sugar manufacturer who says loaf clarified lumps bastard common burnt this honestest manufacturer talk slang
algebra medicine botany have each their slang
to meet the needs of this conflict wretchedness has invented the language of combat w slang
to keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion to hold above the gulf were it but a fragment of some language which men has spoken and which would otherwise be lost that is to say one of the elements good or bad of which civilization is composed or by which it is complicated to extend the records of social observation is deserve civilization itself
phoenician very good
even dialect let that pass
to this we reply in one word only
assuredly if the tongue which an nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interests the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study
and then we insist upon it the study of social deformities and infirmities and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy is not a business in which choices permitted
he must descend with his heart full of charity and severity at the same time as a brother and as a judge to those impenetrable casemates where crawl pell now those you bleed in those who deal the blow those who weep in those who curse those who fast and those who devour those who endure evil and those who inflicted it
do we really know the mount or well when we are not acquainted with the cavern
they constitute to different orders of facts which correspond to each other which are always interlaced had which often bring forth results
true history being a mixture of all things the true historian mingles in everything
facts form one of these and ideas the other
there it clothes itself in word masks in meta four rags
in this s guise it becomes horrible
one perceives without understanding it a hideous murmur sounding almost like human accents but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word
one thinks one years hydras talking
it is unintelligible in the dark
it is black in misfortune it is block or still in crime these two blackness is amalgamated campo slang
the earth is not devoid of his semblance to a jail
look closely at life
it is so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment
each day has its own great gree for its little care
yesterday were trembling for a health at is dear to you to day you fear for your own to morrow it will be anxiety about money the day after to morrow the dia tribe of a slanderer the day after that the misfortune of some friend then the prevailing weather then something that has been broken or lost thin a pleasure with which your conscience and your verb column reproach you again the course of public affairs
this without reckoning in the pains of the heart and so goes on
there is hardly one day out of a hundreds which is holy joyous and sunny
and you belonged to that small class who are a happy
in this worlds evidently the vestibule of another there are no fortunate
the real human division as this the luminous and the shady
to diminish the number of the shady to augment the number of the luminous that is the objects
that is why we cry education science
to teach reading means to like the fire every sil sell out sparkles
however he who says light does not necessarily s joy
people suffering the light excess burns
the flame is the enemy of the wing
to burne without ceasing to fly therein lies the marvel of genius
you'll never dig it out of the aster library
to the young american here or elsewhere the paths to fortune are innumerable and all open there is invitation in the air and success in all his wide horizon
he has no traditions to bind him or guide him and his impulse is to break away from the occupation his father has followed and maken me way for himself
the modest fellow would have liked fame thrust upon him for some worthy achievement it might be for a book or for the skilful management of some great newspaper or for some daring expedition like that of lieutenant strain or doctor came
he was unable to decide exactly what it should be
sometimes he thought he would like to stand and a conspicuous pulpit and humbly preached the gospel of repentance and it even crossed his mind that it would be noble to give himself to a missionary life to some benighted region were the date palm brows and the nightingale's voice is in tune and the bull sings on the op nights
wall seemed to him well enough as a science but he never could discover a practical case where it appeared to him worth while to go to law and all the clients who stopped with this new clerk and the anti room of the law office where he was writing philip invariably advised to settle no matter how but settle greatly to the disgust of his employer who knew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized processes with the attendant bees
it is such a noble ambition that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow foundation
he wanted to begin at the top of the letter
bill of therefore red diligently in the aster library planned literary works that should compel attention and nursed his genius
he had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the dorking convention than in session make a sketch of the men and women on the platform and take it to the editor of the daily grape vine and see what he could get a line for it
oh very well said grando turning away with a shade of contempt you'll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that you can't afford a conscience like that
but its up did afford it and he wrote th king his friends and declining because he said the political scheme would fail and ought the fail
and he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world
well i'm going as an inch near you could go as one
you can begin by carrying a rod and putting down the figures
no would sought you soon
i've ready to go anywhere for six months
the two young men who were by this time full of the adventure went down to the wall street office of henry's uncle and had a talk with that wily operator
the night was spent in packing up in writing letters for philip would not cake such an important step without informing his friends
why it's in missouri somewhere on the frontier i think we'll get a map
i was afraid it was nearer home
he knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter
he well knew the perils of the frontier the savage state of society the lurking indians of the dangers of fever
she was tired of other things
she tried this morning and air or two upon the piano saying a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic voice and then seating herself by the open windows red philip's letter
well mother said the young student looking up with a shade of impatience
i hope thee told the elders that father and irresponsible for the piano and that much as the loves musick the is never in the room when it is played
i heard father till cousin abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now
thy ways greatly try me ruth and all thy relations
is thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the worlds people
i have not asked him r replied with a look that might imply that she was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own mind and then compelled others to make a theirs in accordance with hers
mother i am going to study medicine
margaret bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity
the study medicine
does thee think thee could stand it six months
and besides suppose thee does medicine
i will practise it
where'd and thy family are known
if i can get patience
ruth sat quite still for a time with face and tent and flushed it was out now
the sight sears returned in high spirits from the city
ruth asked the enthusiast if they would like to live in such a sounding mausoleum with its great halls and echoing rooms and no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of any body
and then there was broad street
there certainly was no into it and even ruth was philadelphian enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end or architectural point upon which the weary eye could rest
but neither sain to rad nor broad street neither wonders of the meant nor the glories of the hall were the ghosts of our fathers sit always signing the declaration impressed the visitor so much as the splendors of the chestnut street windows and the bargains on aid street
is thee going to the yearly meeting ruth asked one of the girls
i have nothing to wear reply that in your persons
it has occupied mother a long time to find at the shops d exact shade for her new bonnet
and thee won't go why should i
if i go to meeting at all i like best to sit in the quiet old house in german town where the windows are all opened and i can see the trees and here the sir of the leaves
it such a crush at the yearly meeting at arch street and then there's the row of sleek looking young men who lying the curbstone and starred us as we come out
he doesn't say but it's on the frontier and on the map everything beyond it is marked indians and desert and looks as desolate as a when say leading it was time for him to do something
is he going to started daily newspaper among the kickapoos
father these unjust to fillip he's going into business
he doesn't say exactly what it is said ruth a little dubiously but it's something about land and railroads and the nose father that fortunes are made nobody knows exactly how in a new country
but phillip his honest and he has talent enough if he will stop scribbling to make his way
but a box women are put into measured for it and putting young if we go anywhere its in a box veiled and pinioned and shut in by disabilities
why should i rust and be stupid and sit in inaction because i am a girl
and if i had a fortune would doe want me to lead a useless life
has d consulted thy mother about a career i suppose it is a career the wants
but that wise and placid woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than ruth understood herself
ruth was glad to hear that philip had made a push into the world and she was sure that his talent and courage would make away for him
but the more forgetfulness had then prevailed the more powerful was the force of remembrance when she awoke
miss milner's health is not good
said missus wharton a few minutes after
so there is to me added sandford with a sarcastic near
and yet you must own her behaviour has warranted them has it not been in this particular in coherent and unaccountable
not that i know of not one more that i know of he replied with astonishment at what she had insulated and yet with a perfect assurance that she was in the wrong
perhaps i am mistake and answered she
to ask any more questions of you i believe would be unfair
he seemed to wait for her reply but as she made none he proceeded
oh my lord cried miss woodley with a most forcible accent you are the last person on earth she would pardon me for entrusting
but in such a case miss milner's election of a husband shall not directed mine
if she does not know how to estimate her own value i do
independent of her fortune she has beauty to captivate the heart of any man and with au her follies she has a frankness in her manner an unaffected wisdom in her thoughts of vivacity in her conversation and withal a softness in her demeanour that might alone engage the affections of a man of the nicest sentiments and the strongest understanding
my lord miss milner's taste is not a depraved one it is but too reform
what can you mean by that miss woodley you talk mysteriously
is she not afraid that i will forward her inclinations
again he searched his own thoughts nor ineffectually as before
miss woodley was too little verst in the subjects to know this would have been not to love at all at least not to the extent of breaking through engagements and all the very obstacles that still mitigated against their union
to relieve her from both he laid his hand with force upon his heart and said do you believe me
i will make no unjust use of what i know he replied with firmness i believe you my lord
i have never yet however been vanquished by them and even upon this occasion my reason shall combat them to the last and my reason shall fail me before i do wrong
yees dead these four years and a good job for her too
well as i say it's an awful queer world they clap all the burglars and downing the murderers in the wife beers i allays thought a general reproof would be enough punishment for a wife peter cause he probably has a lott of provocation that nobody knows and the fire bugs can't think of the right named something like sandys and the breakers of the peace and what not and yet the law has nothing to say to a man like hand lord

they began with the one in the family sitting room colonel wheeler ralph thurston mister and missus bill harmon with nat and rufus mister and missus poplin with digby and lowly joy all standing in admiring groups and thrilling with delight at the order of events

length of service fourteen years three months and five days
he seemed born to please without being conscious of the power he possessed
it must be owned and no one was more ready to confess it than himself that his literary attainments were by no means of a high order
we don't spin cops is a favourite saying amongst artillery officers indicating that they do not shirk their duty by frivolous pursuits but it must be confessed that servadac being naturally idle was very much given to spinning tops
once in action he was leading a detachment of infantry through an intrenchment
sometimes he would wander on foot upon the sandy shore and sometimes he would enjoy a ride along the summit of the cliff altogether being in no hurry at all to bringing his task to an end
no cathedral not even burgs itself could vic with a church it mont marta
ben z's most ambitious desire was to induce the captain to go with him and end his days in his much loved home and so incessantly were servadac's ears besieged with descriptions of the unparalleled beauties and advantages of this eighteenth are und sim of paris that he could scarcely hear the name of montmartre without a conscious thrill of aversion
when a private in the eighth cavalry he had been on the point of quitting the army at twenty eight years of age but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to captain servadac
the bond of union thus effected could never be severed and although ben z's achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement he firmly declined all honours or any pension that might part him from his superior officer
unlike his master he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power but his inexhaustible memory made him a living in p cyclopedia and for his stock of anecdotes and trooper's tals he was matchless
fast as his legs could carry him servadac had made his way to the top of the cliff
it was quite true that a vessel was in sight hardly more than six miles from the shore but owing to the increase in the earth's convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision the rigging of the topmasts alone was visible above the water
exclaimed servadac keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope
she is under sale but she is count timascheff's yacht he was right
if the count were on board a strange fatality was bringing him to the presence of his rival
he reckoned therefore not only upon ascertaining the extent of the late catastrophe but upon learning its cause
the wind being adverse the dobryna did not make very rapid progress but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained calm and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold a steady course
servadac took it for granted that the dobryna was endeavoring to put in
a marrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the roughest weather would ensure the calmness of its waters
slightly changing her course she first struck her main sail and in order of facilitate the movements of her helmsman soon carried nothing but her two topsails brigantine and jib
captain servadac hastened towards him
i left you on a continent and here i have the honor of finding you on an island
never mind now interposed the captain we will talk of that by and by
nothing more than you know yourself
are you certain that this is the mediterranean
for some moments he seemed perfectly stupified and then recovering himself he began to overwhelmed the count with a torrent of questions
to all these inquiries the count responded in the affirmative
some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements
you will take me on board count will you not
my yacht is at your service sir even should you require to make a tour round the world
the count shook his head
before starting it was indispensable that the engine of the dobryna should be repaired to sail under canvas only w in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficulty
it was on the last day of january that the repairs of the schooner were completed the
a slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide
doubts now arose and some discussion followed whether or not it was desirable for ben zoof to accompany his master
her sea going qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe
after an apprenticeship on a merchantship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private got in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters
the late astounding events however had rendered procope men vastly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety
steam up and canvas spread the schooner started eastwards
although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earth's attraction rendering the liquid particle so buoyant that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented
for a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of algeria but no land appeared to the south
the log and the compass therefore were able to be called upon to do the work of the sextant which had become utterly useless
there's no fear of that sir
at the earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit but she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipitated on to the sun
and what demonstration do you offer asked servadac eagerly that it will not happen
ocean reigned supreme
all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts sped away to his native france only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the algerian metropolis
is it not impossible he murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely
would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible
another circumstance was most remarkable
to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniformed depth of from fort to five fathoms and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the sight of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheatre
you must see lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you imagined
after pondering a while he said if we were farther away i should expect to find a depth of two or three hundreds fathoms instead of five fathoms five fathoms
its depth remained invariable still four or at most five fathoms and although its bottom was assiduously dredged it was only to prove it baron of marine production of any type
nothing was to be done but to put about and returned in disappointment toward the north
at another time harald asked
what is your country oof had you always been a thrall the thralls eyes flashed
two hundred warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle
the rest of you off of ving he had three ships

we ate it many men's tables u invited
i dragon's belly is never full and on board went the gold

he as though he is not expected us
on a bench and a far corner were a dozen people huddled together

the thralls were ringing in a great pot of meat
they set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it and we sat and watched it boil while we joked at last the supper began
the farmer sat gloomily on the benson would not eat and you cannot wonder for he saw as putting pot falls of his good beef and bask lades of bread and oar big mouths
you would not e with us you cannot sayn to half of my ale i drink this to your health

their eyes danced big tore ley stood up and stretched himself

it was one of the masterly in charming stories of dem the elder
in five minutes i was in a new world and my melancholy room was full of the liveliest french company
the sound of an imperative and uncompromising bell recalled me in due time to the regions of reality
ambrose met me at the bottom of the stairs and showed me the way to the supper room
she signed to me with a ghostly solemnity to take the vacant place on the left of her father
the door opened again while i was still studying the two brothers without i odd slyly confess being very favorably impressed by either up them
a new member the family circle who instantly attracted my attention entered the room
a little cracked that in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supper room

our firsts impressions of people are in nine cases out of tin the right impressions
for once away i proved a true prophet
the only cheerful conversation was the conversation across the table between naomi and me
he looked up at now and we doubtingly from his plate and looked down against slowly with a frown
when i addressed him he answered constrainedly
a more dreary and more disunited family party i never s of the table with
envy hatreds malice and uncharitableness are never so essentially detestable to my mind as when they are animated by the sense of propriety and work under the surface but for my interest in they ow me and my other interest in the little love looks which i now and then surprised passing between her an ambrose i should never have sat through that supper
i wish you good night she laid her bony hands on the back of mister med crops invalid chair cut him shorten his farewell salutation to me and wheel them out to his bed as if she were wheeling him out to his grave

she found the door but it was locked outside
she succeeded in opening the window and the moonlight shone in so brightly that she could distinguish the colour of some damask hanging in the room
she saw that the bed was gilded and so rich that it seemed that of a prince about the that of a private gentleman
among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window
this person was rede fu who though he had gone to look for his friends had changed his mind in that respect not thinking it advisable to acquaint them with what had passed between him in the girl
on the contrary he resolved to tell them that repenting of his violence and moved by a tears he had only carried her halfway towards his house and then let her go

that will be very well my child replied her father if your plan were not liable to be frustrated by ordinary cunning but no doubt this image had been already missed by its owner and he will have set it down for certain that he was taken out of the room by the person he locked up there
what you had best do my child is to keep it and pray to it that since it was a witness to your undoing it will deign to vindicate your cause by its righteous judgment
thus did the humane and right minded father comfort his unhappy daughter and her mother embracing her again did all she could to sew the feelings
she meanwhile passed her life with her parents in the strictest to retirement never letting herself be seen but shunning every eye less it should read her misfortune in her face
time rolled on the hour of her delivery arrived it took place in the utmost secrecy her mother taking up on her the office of midwife as she gave birth to his son one of the most beautiful ever see
on the boy walked tor the streets blessings were showered up him by all who saw him blessing upon his beauty upon the mother that bore him upon the father that begot him upon those who brought him up so well
one day when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsemen
the bed she too well remembered was there and above all the cabinet on which had stood the image she had taken away was still on the same spot
luis was out of danger in a fortnight in a month he rose from his bed and drawing all that time he was visited daily by his mother and grandmother and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he was their own child
thus saying and pressing the perceived to her breast she fell fainting into the arms of donna is sap fenian who has a gentle woman to whose six pity is the natural as cruelty as too man instantly pressed her lips to those of the fainting girl shedding over her so many tears that there needed no other sprinkling of water to recover theo kadi from her son

just then leucadia came to herself and embracing the cross seemed changed into a sea of tears and the gentleman remaining in out of bewilderment until his wife had repeated to him from beginning to end lucius whole story and he believed it through the blessed dispensation of heaven which had confirmed it by so many convincing tests
so persuasive were her entreaties and so strong her assurances that no harm whatever could result to them from the information she sought they were induced to confess that one summer's night the same she had mentioned themselves in another friend being out on the stroll with her doleful they had been concerned in the adoption of the girl whom udolpho carried off was the rest of them detained her family who made a great outcry and would have defended her if they could
for god's sake my lady mother give me a wife who would be in agreeable companion not one who will discuss me so that we may both bear evenly and with mutual good will the yoke impost on us by heaven and that of pulling this way and that way and fretting each other to death
her bearing was graceful and animated she led her son by the hand and before her walked two maids with wax lights and silver candlesticks
al rose to do her reverence as if something from heaven had miraculously appeared before them but gazing on her and tranced with admiration not one of them was able to address a single word to her
she reflected how ne she stood to the crisis which was to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy for ever and racked by the intensity of her emotions she suddenly changed color her head dropped and she fell forward in a swoon into the arms of the dismay aha
his mother had left her to him as being her destined protector but when she saw that he too was insensible she was near making a third and would have done so had he not come to himself

nor was were duff less surprised them they and the better to assure himself h so wonderful a fact he begged lucia to give him some token which should make perfectly clear to him that which indeed he did not doubt since it was authenticated by his parents
you know captain lee
said lord chelford addressing me
he had his hand upon lake shoulder
their are cousins you know we are all cousins
whatever lords chelford said miss brandon received it very graciously and even with a momentary smile
but her greeting to captain leek was more than usually haughty and frozen and her features i fancied particularly proud and pale
at dinner lak was easy of amusing
i'm glad you like it says wilder chuckling benignantly on it over his shoulder
i believe i have a little taste that way those are all real you know those jewels
and he placed it in that gentleman's fingers who now took his turn at the lamp and contemplated the little parallelogram with a gleam of sly amusement
i was thinking it's very like the ace of hearts answered the captain softly smiling on
whereupon lake laughed quietly still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes
and wilder left to more suddenly and noisily than the humour of the joke seemed quite to call for and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes unlike but the gallant captain did not seem to perceive it and after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently back to missus darky only remarking
do you know lake oh i've really can't tell but he'll soon tire of country life
he's not a man for country quarters
i have horrid dream about him last night that
oh i know that's lorn brandon
all the time he was talking to me his angry little eyes were following lake
miss lake declined the carriage to night
and he added something still less complimentary
but don't these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly
in the meantime i had formed in ne idea of her
by this time lord chelford and wilder returned and disgusted rather with myself i ruminated on thy want of generalship
and he made a little dip of his cane towards brandon hall over his shoulder
yes so they said but that would i think h been worse
if a fellows been a little bit wild he is be ends above at once
bracton's a very good fellow i can assure you
i don't know i can't say how you finde gentlemen to find wickedness only as an obscure female i speak according to my lights and he is generally thought the wickedest man in this county
well you know ready women like wicked fellows it is contrast i suppose but they do and i'm sure from what bracton has said to me i know him intimately that dorcas likes him and i can't conceive why they are not married
their walk continued silent for the greater part neither was quite satisfied with the other but rachel at last said
now that's impossible ready for i really don't think i once thought of him all this evening except just while we were talking
there was a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves and the model lights and shadows glided oddly across his pale features
don't insult me stanley by talking again as you did this morning
when i say is altogether on your own account
mark my words you'll find him too strong for you i and too deep
i am very uneasy about it whatever it is i can't help it
to my mind there has always been something inexpressibly awful in family fs
the mystery of their origin their capacity for evolving latent faculties of crime and the study vitality with which they survived the harse and speak their deep malignities in every newborn generation have associated them somehow in my mind with a spell of life exceeding and distinct for human and especial satanic action
the floor were than anything else showed the great age of the room
my bed was unexceptional ply comfortable but in my that mood i could have wished it a great deal more modern
its curtains were of thick and fated tapestry
all the furniture belong to other times
i shan't trouble you about my train of thoughts are fancies but i began to feel very like a gentleman in the g story watching experimentally in a haunted jabers
i did not even take the precaution of smoking up the chimney
i boldly lighted my chute
a cold bright moon was shining with clear sharp lights and shadows
the sombre old trees but gigantic curse plumes black and awful
somehow i had grown nervous
a little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly
it was not very much past le in that morning when the pony carriage from brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of red ming's farm
well she was better though she had had a bad night
so there came a step and a little rustling of feminine dry breezes the small door opened and rachel entered with her hand extended and a pale smile of balcom
women can hide their pain better than we men and bear it better too except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice
but poor rachel leak had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits up her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile
this transit spring and lighting up are beautiful a glamour beguiling our senses
there was something of sweetness and fatness in her tones and manner which was new to rachel and comforting and she returned the grating as kindly and felt more like her form herself
rachel's pale and sharpened features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise
you have been so ill my poor rachel
ill and troubled dear troubled in mind and miserably nervous
poor rachel her nature recoiled from deceit and she told at all events as much of the truth as she dared
she spoke with a sudden energy which partook a fear and passion and flushed her thing cheek and made her languid eyes flash
think you rachel my cousin rachel my only friend
tilford had a note from mister wilder this morning another note his cunning delayed and something of his having to see some person who was broad continued dorcas after a little pause
yes something everything said rachel hurriedly looking frowningly at a flower which she was twirling in her fingers
yes said rachel
and the wan oracle having spoken she sat down in the same sort of abstraction again beside dorcas and she looked full in her cousin's eyes
of mark wilder i say this his name has been for years hateful to me and recently it has become frightful and you will promise me simply this that you will never ask me to speak again about him
it is an antipathy an antipathy i cannot g it over dear dorcas you may think it a madness but don't blame me
i have very few to love me now and i thought you might love me as i have begun to love you
and she threw her arms round her cousin's neck and brave rachel at last burst into tears
dorcas in her strange way was moved
i like you still rachel i'm sure i'll always like you
you resemble me rachel you are fearless and inflexible and generous
yes rachel i do love you
thank you dorcas dere
he began a confused complaint against the wizard who had vanished behind the curtain on the left
give not so earnest to mind to these mummeries child
a golden fortune and a happy life
he was like unto my father in a way and yet was not my father
also there was a stripling page who turned into a maid
this was so sweet lady sir and in some manner i do think she died
but then the picture was gone as quickly as it came
sister knell do you hear these marvels
take your place and let us see what the crisper can show to you
like is not young master though i am an old man
forthwith all ran to the opening of the tent to see what might be amiss but master will who peeped out first needed no more than one glance
he gave way to the others very readily and retreated unperceived by the squire and mistress fitzooth to the rear of the tent
cries of a nottingham a nottingham
before them fled the stroller and his three sons capitis and terrified
what is that tumult and rioting cried out the squire authoritatively and he blew twice on the silver whistle which hung it his belt
nay we refuse they request most politely most noble said the little stroller
and then they became vexed and would have snatched your purse from us
i could not see my boy injured excellence for but doing his duty as one of cumberland sons
so i did push this fellow
it is enough said george game well sharply as he turned upon the crowd
shame on you citizens cried he i blush for my fellows of nottingham
surely we can submit with good grace
tis find for you to talk old man answered the lean sullen apprentices
but i wrestled with this fellow and do know that he played on fairly in the second bout
spoke this wire losing all patient and it was to you that i gave another person consolation
come to me men here here he raised his voice still louder
the stroller took their part in it with hardy zest now that they had some chance of beating off their foes
robin and the little tumbler between them tried to force the squire to stand back and very valiantly did these too comport themselves
the head in chief of the riot the nottingham apprenticed with quench fists threatened montfichet
the squire helped to thrust them all in and entered swiftly himself
now be silent on your lives he began but the captured apprentice set up an instant shout
silence you knave cried montfichet
he felt fur and found the wizard's black cloth the squire was quite out of breath
thrusting open the proper entrance of the tent robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden with a great shout
a mor pica on montfichet game well to the rescue
taking advantage of this the squires few men redoubled their efforts and encourage by robins and the little strolls cries fought their way to him
george montfichet will never forget this day
what is your name lording asked the little stroller presently
robin fitz
and mine as will stuteley shall we be come reads
right willingly for between us we have won the battle answered robin
i like you will you are the second will that i have met and liked within two days is there a sign in that
montfichet called out for robin to give him an arm
friends said montfichet faintly to the wrestlers bear us escort so far as the shirt's house
it will not be say for you to stay here now
pray follow us with mine in my lord gaheris men
noting young castle was reached an admittance was demanded
master monceux the sheriff of nottingham was mightily put about when told of the rioting
and henry might return to england at any moment
have your will child if the boy also will sitten mony shay answered feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then
he made an effort to hide his condition from them all and robin felt his fingers tighten upon his arm
begged me a room of the sheriff child quickly
but who is this fellow plucking into her steve
he is my esquire excellency returned robin with dignity
mistress fitzooth had been carried off by the sheriffs daughter in her maids as soon as they had entered the house so that robin alone had the care of montfichet
robin was glad when at length they were left to their own devices
the winded certainly bring back the color to the squire's cheeks
these escapades are not for old game well led his day has come to twilight
will you forgive me now
it'll be no disappointment to me
no thanks i am glad to give you such easy happiness
you are worthy leech will presently whispered robin the wine has worked a marvell
i and show you some pretty tricks
young fitzooth had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his converse with the squire
there befell an anxious interview mistress fitzooth arguing fore and against the squire's projecting a breath
most of all robin thought of his father what would he counsel
if for when you beggar yourself i cannot stay you
but take it whilst i live and where montfichet yielded in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so brave as sight for you will never disgrace our dutch and i warrant me
the lad eject him then
never that sir he had said
he was in deep converse with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arm
now to bed boy
tis late and i go myself within a short space
dismiss your squire robin and bid me good e
as any in england i would say said came well proudly that is in his day
yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come
there was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to game well's chamber
presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step
will cried he softly and stuteley who had chosen his count across the door of his young master's chamber sprang up at once at answer
we will go out together to the bower there is a way down to the court from my window
rest and be still until i warn you
the hours passed wearily by and movement could yet be heard about the hall
at last all was quiet and black and the courtyard of gamewell
will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready
they then renewed their journey and under the better light may to save crossing of the stable roofs
robin entered the hut dragging the unwilling esquire after him
be not so foolish friend said fitzooth crossly
they moved thereafter cautiously about the hut groping before and about them to find something to show that the warrenton had fulfilled his mission
they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stuteley had tripped over the edge of the reversed flap mouth of this pit
fitzooth's hand rested at last upon the top rung of a ladder and slowly the truth came to him
robin carefully descended the latter and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground
stuteley was by his side in the flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape in characters of this vault
from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice warringtons
save me masters but you startled me rarely
cried he waving the lantern before him to make sure that these were no ghost in front of him
inquired robin with his suspicion still upon him
truly such a horse would be worth much in notting him fair
day nay lording answered warrant and with a half laugh
warrenton spoke thus with significance to show robin that he was not to think jeffreys claimed to the estate would be passed by
robin fitzooth saw that his doubts of warrenton had been unfair and he became ashamed of himself for harbouring them
his tones rang pleasantly on warrenton's ears and forthwith the good fellowship was heralded between them
the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to game well that this passage way led from the hut in a pleasance to sherwood and that jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
he implores u to be discreet as the grave in this matter for in sooth his life is in the hollow of our hands
they regain their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gamewell
out in the wood stood a nice little fir tree
the place he had was a very good one the sun shone on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as furs
he did not think of the warms sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
but this was what the tree could not bear to hear
in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hair would often come leaping along and jumped right over the little tree
oh that made him so angry
to grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most delightful thing in the world
in autumn the woodcutters always came and fell some of the largest trees
this happened every year and the young fer tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and bare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were laden carts and the horses dragged of them out of the wood
have you not met them anyway
rejoice in thy growth said the sun beams
and then what happens then
i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh
were i but already on the cart
where i in the warn room with all the splendor and magnificence
yes and something better something still candor will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ornament me
something better something still grander must follow but what
with choice in our presence said the air and the sunlight
rejoice in my own fresh youths
but the tree did not rejoice at all e grew and grew and was green both winter in summer
and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
the axe struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pangs like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
the departure was not at all agreeable
the tre only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we don't want the others
there too were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture bucks and full of toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the children said so
the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
this evening they all said
how it will shine this evening
perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me
it blazed up famously help help
cried the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire
a story
a story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree
but i shall tell only one story
humpy don't be fell downstairs ann yet he married the princess
that's the way of the world
thought the fur tree and believed at all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
i won't tremble to morrow thought the fur tree
and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought
in the morning the servants and the housemaid came in
but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
what's the meaning of this thought the tree
and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie
time enough had he too for his reflections for days and knights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way
tis now winter out of doors thought the tree
how kind man is after all
if it only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely
squeak squak
they snuffed about the fir tree and rustled among the branches
i am by no means old said the fur tree
there's many a one considerably older than i am
they were so extremely curious
i know no such place said the tree
and then he told all about his youths and the little mice had never heard the light before and they listened and said
said the fur tree thinking over what he had himself related
yes in reality those more happy times
oh is ap don't be asked the mice
only that one answered the tree
it is a very stupids story
don't you know one about bacon and tallow kindles canst shot tell any later stories
no said the tree
then good by said the raps and they went omer
at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listen to what i told them
now that too is over
why one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft
the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
but it was not the thur tree that they meant
it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
in the courtyards some of the marian children were playing who had danced at christmas round the fir tree and were so glad at the sight of him
and the gardener's boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and its side sowed deeply
however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end
genet than beth refrain from dulling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogers visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned who closely about the penalty for forte a check
it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and on gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in the states prison as a consequence of his rash act
i can't see it in that light said the old lawyer
it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved
but they could not have proving a gee against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably a mere bluff
he was softhearted and impetuous said beth and being in love he didn't stop to count the cost
if the prosecution word withdrawn and the gay settled with the victim of the forte check then the young man would be allowed his freedom
but under the circumstances i doubt of such an arrangement could be made
fair views twelve miles away but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county trail
they were received in the little office by a man nay markham who was the jailer
we wish to talk with him answered kenneth talk
i'm running for representative on the republican ticket said kenneth quietly
oh say that's different observed marken altering his demeter
maybe see gates at once asked kenneth
they followed the jailer along the succession of passages
sometimes on that year and for a smoke em nearly crazy and i don't know which his worse died one way or other
he unlocked the door and called here's visitors tom
horse tom harse in error replied the jailer cloy
mister graf said kenneth noticing the boy's face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it
sort we have in any reception room in the jail
s tow please said gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice there's a pen
a fresh wholesome looking boy with tom gates was steady grey eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth
we have heard something of your story said kenneth and are interested in it
i didn't stop to think whether it was foolish you're not i did it and i'm glad i did it
old will as a fine fellow but poor and helpless since missus rogers had are accident
then rogers wouldn't do anything but leader around and wait upon her and the place went to rack and ruin
he spoke simply but paced up and down the nero cell in friend of them
who's name did you sign to the check asked kenneth
he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concert
it's a stop company in rich
i was bit keeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forged the signature
as regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved him a heavy loss one day
i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant go mart shall never even thanked me
it was better for him to think that girl unfeeling than to know the truth
i'm going to see mister marshal said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thank you sir
it won't be much but i'm grateful to find a friend
they left him then for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office
i've see what's at that kind in my day
and it ruins a man's disposition
he looked up rather ungracious weep but motioned them to be seated
some girls is been in here twice to interview my men and i have refused to admit her
i'm not electioneering just now
oh well sir what about em
and he deserved of term and states prison
it is cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance
i'll pay all the caus besides
youre foolish why should you do all this
i have my own reasons mister martial
give me a check for a hundred and fifty and i turned over to you the fort check and quashed further proceedings
he detested the grasping despises him that would endeavour to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gates
beth uneasy at his silence muche him
there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face
he might have had that forted check for the face of it if he'd been sharp
and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars
so to the surprise at the democratic committee and all his friends mister hopkins announced that he would oppose forts aggressive campaign with an equal egress ness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
one of mister hoped in's first tasks after calling his faithful henchman around him was to make a careful countess of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
the weak need contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from a opposition
the democratic committee figured out away to do this
under ordinary conditions reynolds was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to il hopkins
the only thing necessary was to fix seth reynolds and this hopkins arranged personally
and this was why kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy
the description she gave of the coming reception to the women's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the occupant of the other vehicle were
these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing mister forbes
louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted
the fair view band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the re horses of the great house were tax to entertain the guests
tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served
this was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given at elmhurst and the only when within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been the invited guests
the attendants was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted foreseeing great success for their fight
we ought to have more attendants beth said louise approaching her cousin
won't you run into the house and see if martha can't spare one or two more maids
she was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when aunt jane was their mistress here and beth was her especial favorite
the housekeeper led the way and bath followed
for a moment beth stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and o slight smile upon her beautiful face
she was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at elmhurst a plain black gown with a white apron and cap
that she gave a little lap and required no miss beth i'm elizabeth parsons
but it can't be protested the girl
i attend to the household bending you know and care for the linen
you speak like an educated persons said beth wonderingly where is your home
for the first time the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor
she sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rock slowly back and forth i'm sorry said beth
eliza parsons shook her head
they they excite me in some way and i i can't bear them you must excuse me
she even seemed mildly amused at the attentions she attracted
myth was a beautiful girl the handsomest of the three cousins by far yet eliza sur past her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact
her mather was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well bad composure and calm reliance
her eyes wondered to the maid's hand
however her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story
she rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath
i wish i knew myself she cried fiercely
will you leave be alone in my own room or must i go away to escape you
eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and a key clicked in the lock
concord returned to its place amidst the tents
the english footed to the french baskets of flowers of which they had made a plentiful provision to gree bey arrival of the young princess the french in return invited the english to a supper which was to be given the next day
congratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey
from the respects pain her on all signs she seemed like a queen and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three she appeared an object of worship the queen mother gave the french the most affectionate reception france was her native country and she had suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget friends
she taught her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had both been hospitably received and where a brilliant future opened for them
the count had thrown himself back on his seat leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus his face buried in his hands with heaving chest and restless limbs
this has indeed been a harassing day continued the young man his eyes fixed upon his friend
you will be frank with me i always am
can your imagine my buckingham has been so violent i suspects
it is you more mistaken row i have read is distress in his eyes in his every gesture and action the whole day
i can perceive love clearly enough
i am conceded of what i say said the count
it is annoyance then
in those very terms i even added more
but continued rowl not interrupted by this movement of his friend heavenly praised the french who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet reckless even are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to barrow matters of such high importance
thus it is that the honour of three is sainted our country are masters and our own
yes i kneed repose many things have agitated me to day both in mind and body when you return to morrow i shall no longer be the same man
but in this friendly pressure roue could detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict
the night was clear starlit and splendid the tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life peace and security everywhere
upon the large square in front of the hotel the shadows of the tents intersected by the golden moon deems formed as it were a huge mosaic of jet and yellow flagstones
boon watched for some time the conduct of the two lovers listened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of manicamp who snored as imperiously as though he was wearying his blue and gold instead of his violet suit
goliath makes another discovery
there were certainly no near the solution of their problem
the poor little things cried cynthia think of them having been turned to the wall all these years
now what is the sense of it two if babies like that
but joys had not been listening all at once she put on her candle on the table and faced her companion
the twin brother did something she did like and she turned his picture to the wall
hers happened to be on the same frame too but she evidently ding care about it
now what have you to say said this brag
i thought we were stumped again when i first saw that be sure but it spin of some use after all
do you suppose the miniature was a copy of the same thing
what of the world is it cleary choice
they were am terribly am besides unlight to see what this lovely furniture looks like without such quantities of dust all over it to it schemes sin
will come and hear this afternoon with old clothes on and ha a regular house clinging
it can't hurt anything i'm sure for we won't disturb things at all
this thoughts however did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair
smuggling the house cleaning pare familia into this cellar window unobserved that afternoon proved no easy task for cynthia had added a whisk broom and dust pan to the outfit
fleer proved too much form and he came sporting after it as frisky as a young kitten much to
oh let him come along she urged idee log to see him about that old house
he makes it sort of closer
mallets dust the furniture and pictures
yet little as it was it had already made a vast difference in the aspects of the room
surface us at least had been removed and the fine old furniture gave the hint of its real elegance and polish
then she suddenly remarked
and my pocket money is getting low again and you have it any left as usual
they say illumination by candlelight is the prettiest in the world
why it's goliath as usual the both cried peering in
isn't he the greatest for begin to odd corners
forgetting all their weariness they seized the candles and storied through the house finding on occasional paper tucked away in some odd corner
well i confessed at the boded up house mystery happen not earlier than april sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probably not much later
no words were spoken no language was uttered save that of wailing and hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and not in reality
i heard a noise behind i turned and saw kaffer his black eyes shining wall in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted above his head as if to strike but i had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me
on were s a distant voice
no sound broke the stillness of the night
the story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition i wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said
what was that
what then a human hand large and shaly appeared distinctly on the surface of the pond
nothing more not even the wrist to which it might be attached
it did not beckon or indeed move at all it was as still as the hand of death
i awoke to consciousness fighting at first it seemed as if i was fighting with the phantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was kaffer
a sound of voices a flash of light
a feeling of freedom and i was awake where
said another voice which i recognized ful choose kaffer
i had scarcely known when i had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke i looked at my hands
in the light of the moon i saw a knife read with blood and my hand too was also discoloured
i do not know i am dazed bewildered
but that is caffs knife
i know he had at this very evening
i remembered saying have we've been together
we chair picked up something from the ground and looked at it
i say you do know what this means and you must tell us
a terrible thought flashed into my mind
i had again been acting under the influence of this man's power
perchance too caffs death might serve him in good stead
my tongue refused articulate my power of speech left me
my position was too terrible
my overwrought nor sealed it at last
for some time after that i remembered nothing distinctly
the three modes of management
to suppose that the objects of this work is to aid in affecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
by reason and affection
as the chase drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexation an ill humor surge and swell among those delegate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps and
the mother as soon as the chase is so far turned that mary can no longer watch the expression of her confidence goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfaction on her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice
so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but we'll stay at home contentedly won't you
the mother in managing the case in this way realise partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appealed to her affection
if you should not be a good girl but should show signs of making us any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone
but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if merry has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble
it is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection cannot be overrated
to such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
della had a young sister named maria and a cousin whose name was jane
now gila contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls
to give an idea of these conversations i will report one of them in full
you have come idella and della was the name of janes doll to make rosalie a visit
i am very glad
i expects you have been a very good curl and ella since you were here last
then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has she been a good girl jane
for instance one day the children had been plain upon the pips with blocks and other playthings and finally had gone ino the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
they were now playing with their dolls in the parlour
delia came to the parlor and with an air of great mystery beckon the children aside and said to them in a whisper leave adela and rosalie here and don't say a word them
so saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the room and round by a sir cus root to the piazza there
said she pointing to the playthings see
put these plea things all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know anything about your leaving them out
and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any directed rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been
nature of the effect produced by early impressions
that he is comparatively nothing
they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
we have going to any such extreme is this we can easily see on reflection how vast in influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action in theatre years must be exerted by the nature and characters of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impress upon the mind
the paine produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
but ands cared nothing about that
he made bout so deep that his back came near breaking and he was done founded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but ands
he was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife
now this knife was a splendid one though half the blab was gone and the handle was a little cracked and ands new that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife
yes why not thought ands
seeing that i am so fine i may as well go and do it the king
i am going to the court ball answered ands
and she took and her's hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every thirds step and through the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing where ever he went
for like as not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap
at the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rose
on huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters
the princess set down under a blue canopy with bouquets a roses and she let and her sit in a golden chair by her side
but you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to they get off
the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition
he only shook his head
well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him
that is a very fine cap you have he said
so it is said ands
and it is made of mother's best yarn and she knitted it herself and everybody once to get it away from me
with one jump ands got out of his chair
he darted lake an arrow through all the halls down all the stairs and across the yard
he still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open
but when his big brother hed that he had refused to give his cap for a king's golden crown he said that ands was a stupid
ands face grew red
but his mother hug been close
no my little son she said
if you dressed in sil and gold from top to tow you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap
at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five o'clock the king entered his cabinet were his tailors or awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had caused so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court
ah very well
let him come in then said the king and as if colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself a colon with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two courtiers
gentleman do your posts whereupon saint annon in viler roy took their leave
certainly sire but i must have money to do that what
what c do you mean inquired louise
he has given them with too much grace not to have utter still to give if they are required which h the case at the present moment
it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned
does your majesty then no longer believe the disloyal attent
not at all you are on the contrary most agreeable to me
your majesty's planned then in this affair is
you will take them from my private treasure
the news circulated with the rapidity of lightning during its progress it kindled every vari of coquetry desire and wild ambition
the king had completed his toilet by nine o'clock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers
the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dais or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theatre of wonderful elegance of construction
suddenly for the purpose of restoring peace in order spring accompanied by his hall court made his appearance
the seasons allies of spring followed him closely to form a quadra which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the ants
his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage in flesh colored silken hose a silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
there was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seemed to sore long
yes it is suppressed
far from its sire your majesty having given no directions about it the musicians retained
yes sire and ready dressed for the ballet
sire he said your majesty's most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he has already shown on the field of battle
the king seemed only pleased with everyone present
monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter
the bally began the effect was more than beautiful
when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutored pantomime of that period only the more natural on account of the very indifferent acting of the august actors had reached its culminating point of triumph the theatre shook with tumultuous applause
disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgment he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked preference of the princess
by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupefied
the king who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quad real cast a look upon his vanquished rival
everyone could observe his agitation and prostration a prostration which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and his eyes with all their bright intelligence be dimmed
upon us madame dig to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte observing
do you think so she replied with indifference
yes the characters which you are royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own
explain yourself
i allude to the goddess
the princess inquired no
she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance
the arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally
a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theatre but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love is thus strangely constituted he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from their presence of one who had broken his heart
when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself
remain i implore you the evening is most lovely
indeed up
i remember now and i congratulate myself do you love anyone
forgive me i hardly know what i am saying a thousand times forgive me madame was right quite right this brutal exile has completely turned to my brain
there cannot be a doubt he received you kindly for in fact you returned without his permission
oh mademoiselle why have i not a devoted sister or a true friend such as yourself
what already here they said to her

good gracious as the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind

let us run then said all three and gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thickest cover of the park
in fact the sound of madam's and a queen's carriages could be heard in the distance upon the hard dry ground of the roads followed by the mountain cavaliers
in this way the fet of the whole court was a fet also for the mysterious inhabitants of the forest for certainly the dear in the brake the pheasant on the branch the fox in its whole were all listening
all about him was a tumult of bright and broken color scattered in broad splashes
the merganser had a crested head of ear descent green black a broad collar of lustrous white black back black and white wings white belly sides finely penciled and black and light and a breast of rich chestnut read streaked with black
his feet were red his long narrow beak with its saul tooth edges and sharp hooked tip was bright red
but here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls hawks and eagles he had no rending falls
but suddenly street and swift as a di and cormorant he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface
once fairly a wing however he wheeled and made back hurriedly for his perch
and might have seemed that a trout of this size was a fairly substantial meal
but such was his keenness that even while the wide flukes of his en gorge victim were still sticking out at the corns of his beak his fierce redd eyes were once more appearing downward into the torrent and search a fresh prey
in despair he hurled himself downward too soon
the great hawk followed hurriedly to retrieve his prey from the ground
the cat growled softly picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it
in fact he had just minish it the last of the trout's tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strained gullet when the baffled haw caught sight of him and swooped
the hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if surprised
like his unfortunate little cousin the teal he too had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank deep fringed with weeds where the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him
the hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface
almost instantly you has forced to the top
straightway the hoo glided from his perch and darted after him
but at this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down
but this frequenter of the heights of air for all his savage valor was troubled at the leaping waves and the tossing foam of these mad rapids he did not understand them
as he flew his down reaching clutching talents were not half a yards ab the fugitive head
where the ways for an instant sank they came closer but not quite within grasping reach
but as before the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer and he was able to flap his way onward in the cloud of foam bile doom hung low above his head yet hesitated to strike
the hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged and pursuit as a weasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived
he had a lot of line out and the place was none too free for a long cast but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was speeding
the last drop fly as luck would have it caught just in the corner of the hawks angrily opened beak hooking itself firmly
at the sudden sharp stinging of it the great bird turned his head and noticed for the first time the fishermen standing on the bank
the dragon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling
then the leader parted from the line

indeed irresolution me the keen out of hamlets soliloquy a clever player could to some extent indicate the whole thirty lines by a sil working of the jab but at the same time it would be idle to deny that he would miss the finer shades of the dramatists meaning
we moderns however see the absurdity of it
if it be granted first that the thoughts of a certain characters should be known to the audience and secondly that soliloquy were the habit of linking allowed is in opposition to modern stage type nin how shall have solo call be avoided without damage to the play
and so on till you get the end one o feele might say ah yes or something non committal of that sort
this were being easy way of doing it but it would not be the best way for the re wh that it is too easy to call attic into itself
in the old badly made play it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence
in the modern well constructed play he simply rings up an imaginary confederate and tells them what he is going to do could anything be more natural

that summer's emigration however being meanly from the free states greatly changed the relative strength of the two parties
for general service therefore requiring no special effort the numerical strength of the factions was about equal one on extraordinary occasions the two thousand border ruffian reserve lying a little farther back from the state mine could at any time easily turned the scale
the free state men had only their convictions their intelligence their courage and the moral support of the north the conspiracy had its secret combination the territorial officials the legislature the bogus laws the courts the militia officers the president and the army

several hundred free state men promptly responded to the summons
it was in fact the best weet thot its day
the leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town
one at his militia generals suggested that the governor should require the outlaws at lawrence and elsewhere to surrender the sharp's rifles another wrote asking him to call out the government troops at fort leavenworth
the governor on his part becoming doubtful of the legality of employing missouri militia to enforce kan's laws was also eager to secure the help of federal troops
sheriff jones had his pockets always full of writs issued in the spirit of persecution but was often baffled by the sharp wits and ready resources of the free state people and sometimes defied outright
little by little however the latter became hymn and bound in the mashes of the various devices and proceedings which the territorial officials evolved from the bogus laws
to embarrass this damaging exposure judge lek issued a wid against the ex governor on a frivolous charge of contempt
the incident was not violent nor even dramatic no pansy was summon no further effort made and reader fearing personal violence soon fled in disguise
but the affair was magnified as a crowning proof that the free state men were insurrections and outlaws
from these again sprang barricaded and fortified dwellings camps and scout parties finally culminating in roving gorilla bands half partisan half predatory
their distinctive characters however display one broad and unfailing difference
the frere stint men clung to their prairie towns and prairie vines with all the obstinacy and courage of true defenders of their homes and firesides
there assumed characters changed with their changing opportunities or necessities
in the shooting of sheriff jones and lawrence and in the refusal of ex govern or reader to allow the deputy marshal to arrest him they discovered grave offenses against the territorial and the united states laws

to their sorrow they were soon undeceived
the military force partly rabble partly organized had meanwhile moved into the town
he planted a company before the hotel and demanded a surrender of the arms belonging to the frere state military companies
half an hour later turning a deaf ear to all remonstrance he gave the proprietors until five o'clock to remove their families and personal property from the frere state hotel

though thrown int to prison for this enterprise and detained some time he was not discouraged but still continued by his countenance and protection to infuse spirit into the distressed royalists
among other persons of distinction who united themselves to him was lord napier of murchison son of the famous inventor of the logarithms the person to whom the title of a great man is more justly due than to any other whom his country ever produced
while the former foretold that the scottish covenanters were secretly forming a union with the english parliament and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking the latter still insisted that every such attempt would precipitate them into measures to which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined
the king's ears were now opened to mont ross counsels who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cause in scotland
five hundred men more who had been levied by the covenanters were persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combined force he hastened to attack lord alco who lay at perth with an army of six thousand men assembled upon the first news of the irish invasion
dreading the superior power of argyle who having joined his vassals to a force levied by the publick was approaching with a considerable army montrose hastened northward in order to rouse again the marquis of huntley and the gordons who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the covenanters
this nobleman's character though celebrated for political courage and conducted was very low for military prowess and after some skirmishes in which he was worsted he here allowed montrose to escape him
by quick marches through these inaccessible mountains that general freed himself from the superior forces of the covenants
with these and some reinforcements of the athol men and mo donalds whom he had recalled montrose fou suddenly upon argyle's country and let loose upon it all the rage of war carrying off the cattle burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword
this severity by which montrose sullied his victories was the result of private animosity against the chieftain as much as of zeal for the publick cause a guile collecting three thousand men marched in quest of the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at inner loci supposing himself still at a considerable distance from them
by a quick and unexpected march montrose hastened to inner loki and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised but not the frightened covenants
his conduct and presence of mind in this emergence appeared conspicuous
montrose weak in cavalry here line his troops of horse with infantry and after putting the enemy's horse to rout fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cut in pieces th with the loss of th gallant lord gordon on the part of the royalists
from the same men new regiments and new companies were formed different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands as the independence could remi on
besides members of parliament who were it excluded many officers unwilling to serve under the new generals threw up their commissions and and warily facilitated the project of putting the army entirely into the hands of that faction
though the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible a more exact plan was introduced and rigorously executed by these new commanders
valour indeed was very generally diffused over the one party as well as the other during this period discipline also was attained by the forces of the parliament but the perfection of the military art in concerting the general plans of action and the operations of the field scenes still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting
historians at least perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience have not remarked anything but a headlong impetuous conducts each party hurrying to a battle were valor and fortune chiefly determined the success
he passed through henley saint albans and came so near to london as harrow on the hill
the scottish generals and commissioners affected great surprise on the appearance of the king and though they paid him all the exterior respected due to his dignity they instantly set a guard upon him under color of protection and made him in reality a prisoner
they informed the english parliament of this unexpected incident and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king

before the settlement of terms the administration must be possessed entirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms and how incompatible that skin with the liberty of the king is easily imagined
the english it is evident had they not being previously assured of receiving the king would never have parted with so considerable a sum and while they weakened themselves by the same measure have strength and a people with whom they must afterwards have so material an interest to discuss
if any still retained rancor against him in his present condition they passed in silence while his well wishes more generous than prudent accompanied his march with tears with acclamations and with prayers for his safety

the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficulty part of our whole enterprise
what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bringing up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual corals all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that i does approximately represent impressions
and what sort of evidence is logically possible
there is no logical impossibility and the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with the population that remembered a wholly unreal past
all that i am doing is to use its logical ti ability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
the behaviourist to attempts to make psychology a record of behavior has to trust his memory in making the record
habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist fills confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
but i do not think such an inference is warranted
our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a france face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
some images like some sensations fill very familiar while others fill strange
familiarity is a filling capable of degrees
in an image of a well known face for example some parts may fl more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
they must have some characteristic which makes us regarded them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the filling of greater or less remoteness and some remembered event
there may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of past ness especially where immediate memory is concerned
there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of too remembered events
it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such fillings must play an essential part in the process of dating remember events
if we had retained the subjects or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
remembering has to be a present occurrence and some way resembling or relighted to what is remembered
some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arriv
in this case as in most others what may be taken a certain in advance is rather v
the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediate
this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gram phones as they like to believe
i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
symons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
they give laws according to which images of past occurrence is come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge
it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it lees ass to search the environment until we are satisfy that we have found the appropriate objects which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the fling of familiarity alone
a further stage is recognition
recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more that a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an objects that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word
this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not
there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before then as this has existed before
the definition of my experience is difficulty broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
thus if i recognize the thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition the recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world
of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
i remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light
had even crasweller not been good looking had jacked been still at college had sir kennington oval remained in england had mister bonnet and the barkeeper not succeeded and stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in arranging for the final departure of my old friend
on arriving at home at my own residence i found that our salon was filled with a brilliant company
as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mode of address that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self
i have come to your sure as mister president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world
we have our little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rose water
we are quite satisfied now captain battle axe said my wife
quite satisfy said eva
the ladies and compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic are on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed or on the other
no doubt in process of time the ladies will follow
their master said missus neverbend
i did not mean said captain battleaxes the touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this
missus never been you must indeed be proud of your son
jack had been standing in the four corner of the room talking to eva and was now reduced to silence by his praises
sir kennington oval is a very fine player said my wife
i and my wife and son and the two crest wells and three or four others agreed to din on board the ship on the next
this i felt was paid to me as being president other republic and i endeavored to be hid myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might be fit the occasion but i couldn but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life
my wife on the spur the moment managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner
this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with there
then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
oh yes said jack and i'm nowhere
but i mean to have my innings before long
of what missus never ben had gone through and providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success
we sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then went ashore
how much of evil of real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me during the last few days
well could i do now but just lay myself down and die
and the death of which i drum could not alas
when this captain should have taken himself and as vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the furthers side of the island and there are in seclusion what i end my days
jack would become e as happy husband and would remain ams the hurried duties of the eager world
thinking of all this i went asleep
mister never bend began the captain and i observe that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president there cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
you have received us with all that courtesy in hospitality for which your character' in england stand so high
it is a duty said i
but your power is so superi to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace and yielding to it
not a doubt but had your force been only double or trouble our own i should have found it my duty to struggle with you
that is all quite true mister never ben said sir ferdinand brown
i can afford to smile because i am absolutely perilous before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force
you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i had been on board
then said sir fernando there is nothing for it but that we must take you with him
there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
you hear what sir ferdinand o brown a sad replied captain battle axe
but one is the delicate mission i asked
i was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhere or drown upon the voyage and mattered not which
then the republic of britannula was to be declared as none existent and the british flag was to be resulted and a british governor installed in the executive chambers
you may be quite shorts there said captain battle ax and that i can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board
you propose to kid not me i said
well we become with your gun were i to kid up you
lieutenant crosstrees is a very gallant officer
one of us always remains on board while the others on shore
what world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crush them both by my words had it been possible my just like centered itself on surf nanda
you will allow me to suggested he but that is a matter of opinion
were i to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter
the letter ran as follows
sir i have in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which h called britannula
the peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your excellency's knowledge
but in their selection of a constitution the britain ne lists have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprung their present difficulties
it is founded on the acknowledge weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men ceased to work
but it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your governor
the john bright is arm with a weapon of great power against which it is impossible that the people of britain euler should prevail
you will carry out with you one hundred men of the north northwest birmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own security as it is thought that if mister never ben be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience
wind you intend that the john bright shall start
to day i shouted
and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the archy of the government
i shall be happy to take charge of them said sir fernando
they of course must all be author
or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible
your power is sufficient i said
if you will give us your promise to meet kept them alex here at this time to morrow we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the john bright for twenty four hours
and this plan was adopted too in order to extract for me a promise that i would depart in peace
this was what did the mischief so far as the running away was concerned
it is hardly necessary to say more of them here

a few years back one of their slaves a coachman was kept on the coach box one cold night when they were out at a ball until he became almost frozen to death in fact he did die in the infirmary from the effects of the frost about one week afterwards
the doctor who attended the injured creature in this case was simply told that she slipped and fell down the stairs as she was coming down
another case said john wesley was a little girl half grown who was washing windows upstairs one day and unluckily fell asleep in the windows and in this position was found by her mistress in a raged the mistress hid her a heavy slap knocked her out of the windows and she fell to the pavement and died in a few hours from the effects thereof
as usual nothing was done in the way of punishment

substantially this was jacob's unvarnished description of his master and mistress

three seconds before the arrival of j be hobson's letter i know more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the northwest passage
even so i had just returned from an arduous journey exhausted and badly needing a rest
i wanted nothing more than to see my country again my friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved collections
but now nothing could hold me back
cas was my man servant
from rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the botanical gardens the boy had come to know a thing or two
classifying was everything to him so he do nothing else well versed in a theory of classification he was poorly first in its practical application and i doubt that he could tell a sperm will from a blin whale
and yet what a fine gallant lad
not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of the journey
never did he objected to buckling up his suit case for any country whatever china or the congo no matter how far off it was
he went here there and everywhere in perfect contentment
pleace forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting that i had turned forty
he was a fanatic on formality and he only addressed me in the third person to the point where it got h some
there was good reason to stop and think even for the worlds most emotionless man
conseil at called a third time conseil appeared
dead masters summon me he said entering
back as much into my trunk as you can my traveling kit my suits shirts and socks don't bother counting just squeeze it all in and hurry
we'll de with them lighter what
anyhow we'll leave instructions to ship the home menagerie to france
yes we are certainly i replied evasively but after we make a detour
a route slightly less directed that's all
were leaving on the abraham lincoln
you see my friend it's an issue of the monster the notorious nor awhile
we don't know where we'll take us
but we're going just the same
we have a commander whose game for anything
i left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dyed plants to paris france
i opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the barbara and conseil at my heels i jumped into a carriage
our baggage was immediately ceded to the deck of the frigate i rushed aboard
i asked her commander fergit
one of the sailors led me to the after deck where i stood in the presence of a smart looking officer who extended his hand to me
in person welcome aboard professor your cabin is waiting for you
i was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officers ms
will be quite comfortable here i told conseil
and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some scepticism
the wharves of brooklyn and every part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers
departing from five hundred thousand throats three cheers burst forth in succession
thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hailing the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river at the tip of the long pal of that forms new york city
then he rushed downstairs into the courtyard shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to patch everybody his dominions that the sailorman was not recaptured
hold him fast min and as soon as ive had my coffee and openin i'll take him to the room of the great knife and patch him
i wouldn't mind l cup a going myself said cam bu i have had considable exercise this morning and i m ready for breakfast
but cap'n bille made no such attempt knowing it would be useless
as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boolooroo gave a yell of disappointment
the room of the great knife was high and big and around it ran rose of benches for the spectators to sit upon
in one blace at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant throne chairs for the king and queen and six smaller but richly a poste chairs for the snub nos princesses
therefore her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her
rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon no persons and the royal ladies were fully as corcus as the were haughty and overbearing
morning girl so people as when as you look
control yourselves in my dears replied the boolooroo the worse punishment i know how to inflict on any one this prisoners is abu to suffer you will see a very pretty patching my royal daughters
suppose its of brim
the captain shook his head
why you sick to fetch the first living cher we met and that was the splay the captain panting hard as he held fast to one of the goats horns
the idea of patching cap'n bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him and a more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter
they look something alike you know suggested the captain of the guards looking from one to the other doubtfully and there nearly the same size if he stand the boat them on ass high legs they've bothy got the same style of whiskers and there both of them obstinate in dangerous so they ought to make a good patch splendid
fine curious
when this had been accomplished the boolooroo leaned over to ty to a discover why the frame welled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzle because it had never done such thing before
at once the goat gave a leap escaped from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the boolooroo
before any could stop him he bed his majesty so furiously that the king sword far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay moaning and groaning
the goats warlike spirit was roused by their successful a tap
then they sped in great haste for the door and the go gave a final but that sent the row of royal ladies all dying into the corridor in another tangle whereupon they shrieked in a matter that terrified everyone of th sound of their voices
i had a notion it was you may d say me from the knife
i didn't shiver much being balance tight but when i loves i mean to have just swung good shiver to relieve my feelings
c and get the boolooroo she said throwing towards the benches
so they were quite willing to obeyed the orders of their girl queen and in a short time the blasts of trumpets and roll of drums and clashing of symbols told trot and cap'n bill at the blue bands had assembled before the palace
then they all march sat a little way into the fields and found that the army of pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily towards them
at the head of the pinkies were get ghisizzle and button bright who had the perrot on his shoulder and there were supported by captain cory and captain ten tant and rosily the witch
when the blue scan saw git casal they raised another great shout for he was the favorite of the soldiers and very popular with all the people
since last thursday i kip ghisizzle have been the lawful boolooroo of the blue country but now that you are conquered by queen shot i suppose i am conquer two and you have no boolooroo at all
when he finished she said cheerfully
don't worry says ole dear it all come right pretty soon
now then let's enter the city and enjoyed the great feast at's being cooked i nearly starn myself for this conquering kingdoms as hard work
then she gave rosalie back herr ma green thanking the kind which for all she had done for them
you are mate replied the sailor
it will be such a satisfaction
the guards had a terrible struggle with the goat which was loose in the room and still wanted to fight but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the boolooroo out of the frame who was tied in and brought both him and the goat before queen trot who awaited them in the throne room of the palace
i'll gladly do that promised the new boolooroo and i'll feed the honourable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans gan eat besides the grass
excuse me said shu i ne greeted to tell you that you're not the boolooroo any more
the former foolery groaned
how i'll be wicked any more sighed the old boolooroo oll reformed
as a private citizen i shall be a model of deportment because it would be dangerous to be otherwise
when first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever but the blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and jeered them for there was not a single person in all the blue country who loved the princesses the least little bit
so ghip gus isle ordered the captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home
that evening trot gave a grand ball in the palace to which the most important of the pinkies and the blueskins were invited
the combined bands of both the countries played the musick and a fine supper was served
brighter than early dawns most brilliant die are blown clear bands of color through the sky that swirl and sweep and meat to break and foam like rainbow bills upon a bubbles dome
guided by you how we might stroll towards stat our only music one another's breath through gardens intimate with hollyhocks where a silent poppies burn between the rocks by pools where birches been to confidants above green waters scum with lily plans
venice
in a sunset glowing of crimson and gold she lives the glory of the world a beached kings galley whose sails are furled who was hung with tapestries rich and old
the pity that we must come and go
while the old gold and the marvel days f ever gleaming its soft char blaze calm in the early evening glow
the pleasant graveyard of my soul with sentimental cyprus trees and flowers is filled that i may stroll and meditation at my ease
it is my heart hung in the sky and no clouds ever float between the grave flowers and my heart on high
over the track lined city street the young man the grinning man pass
ho ye sails that seemed to wonder in dream filled meadows say is the shore where i stand the only filled of struggle or are yee hit and battered out there by waves and wust as y ta over a clashing sea of watery echoes
old dances are simplified that their yearning bleached by time
he had got into her courtyard
through the black night rain he sang to her windows bars
that was but rustling of dripping plants in the dark
she was alone that night
he had broken into her courtyard
to fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day down by the river of a dana her soft voices heard and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning deu
o life of this o spring
why fades the lotus of the water
why fate these children of the spring
fell is like a watery bow and like a parting cloud like a reflection in a glance like shadows in the water like dreams of infants like a smile upon an infants face
like the dove's boys like transient day like music in the air ah
and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gently hear the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time
the lily of the valley breathing in the humble grass answered the lovely maiden said i am a watry weed and i am very small and love to dwell in lowly veils so weak the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head yet i am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all walks in the valley and each mourn over me spreads his hand saying rejoice thou humble grass thou newborn lily flower
thou gentle made of silent valleys and of modest brooks for thou shall be clothed in light and fed with morning manna till summers heat melts thee beside the founts and the springs to flourish in eternal veils they why should fell complain
why should the mistress of the veils of car utter a sigh
she ceased and smiled in tears then sat down in her silver shrine
which thou dst scatter on everye little blade of grass that springs revives the milked cow and tames the fire breathing steed
but fell is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun i vanish from my pearly throne and who shall find my place
and wyat scatters its bright beauty through the human air
descend a little cloud and hover before the eyes of fell
ah little cloud the virgin said i charge thee to tell me why thou com plainest now when in one hour thou fate away then we shall seek thee but not finde ah fell is like to thee
i pass away yet i complain and no one hears my voice
the cloud then showed his golden head and his bright form emerged
and farce thou because i vanish and a seen no more
it is too ten ful life to love to peace and raptures wholly unseen descending weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers and court the fair i do to take me to her shining tent the weeping virgin trembling meals before the risen son
till we arise linked and a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers
lives not alone nor of itself fear not and i will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice
come forth worm and the silent valley to thy pensive queen
the helpless worm arose and sat upon the lily's leaf and the bright clouds sailed on defined his partner in the veil
image of weakness art thou but a worm
i see they lay helpless and naked weeping and none to answer none to cherish thee with mother's smiles
and says thou mother of my children i have loved thee and i have given thee a crown that none can take away
and lay me down and i cold bed and leave my shining lot
or an eye of gifts and graces showering fruit and coined gold
why a tongue impressed with honey from every wind
why an ear a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in
alway said without a word
i suit beneath thy looks as children do in the noon sun with souls that tremble through their happy eelids from an una yet prodigal inwards joy
i did not wrong myself so but i placed a wrong on thee
when called before i told how hastily i dropped my flowers or break off from a game
shall i never miss home talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each in turn nor counted strange when i look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this
alas i have grieved so i am hard to love
open thy heart wide and fold within the wed wings of thy dove
could it mean to last a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow
nay i rather thrill distrusting every light that seemed to gi be onwards path and fear to overlain a finger even
and though i have grown serene and strong since then i think that god h willed a still renee fear
o love o troth
and love be faults
if he to keep one oath must lose one joy by his life's star foretold
slow to world greetings quick with its oh list when the angel speak
a ring of amethyst i could not wear here plainer to my sight than that first kiss
that was the chrism of love which love's own crown with sanctifying sweetness did proceed the third upon my lips was folded down in perfect purple state since when indeed i have been proud and said my love my own
dearest teach me so to pour out gratitude as thou dst good
mussulmans and guyers throw kerchiefs at a smile and half no ruth for any weeping
but thou art not such a lover my beloved
thou canst wait through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch and think it soon when others cry too late
i think all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine
oh to shoot my souls full meaning into future years that they should lend it utterance and salute love that endures from life that disappears
then i long tried by natural received the comfort fast while budding at thy sight my pilgrims staff gave out green lees with morning dews empearled
i love thee freely as men strive for right i love thee purely as they turned from praise
i love thee with the passion put to use in my old greeds and with my childhood's faith
i love thee with a love i seemed to lose with my lost saints i love thee with the breath smiles tears of all my life and if god choose i shall but love thee better after death
