stephen leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler listened to the talk about him which hern checked from time to time by saying

a gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged stephen to ask a difficult question
the rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from
he clasped his hands on the desk and said
the retreat will begin on wednesday afternoon in honour of saint francis saviour whose feast day is saturday

stephen's heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower

the rector paused and then shaking his clasped hands before him went on
he had the faith in him that moves mountains

their piety would be like their names like their faces like their clothes and was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts it might be pay a far richard tribute of devotion than his had ever been a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration
it was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates stripped of his pride beaten and in beggar's weeds that they would be generous towards him loving him as themselves
idle and embittering finally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbor as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kinds of love

you will find me continually speaking of four men titan hob and turner and tin cette and almost the same terms
they unite every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists sometimes as curs crests
by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the cure securest devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing un separated light a colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light

do not therefore think that the gothic schools an easy one
the law of that schools that everything shall be seen clearly or least only in such mister faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introductions to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden grounded
this at once compels you to understand that the workest to be imaginative and decorative that a represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact your producing jewel's work rather than pictures
that a style restrained or severe does not mean that it is also arann
in all early gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and rigidity which are many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art
the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble ill drawn figures that is merely childish and failing work of an infer hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any others school
but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquility of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purest painting unless you are actively engaged and promoting the felicity and peace of practical life

let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what ile presently givee
poor duglas before his death when it was insight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with ams effects he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth
the departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't of course thank heavens stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a rage of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked u up
the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took at the tail at a point after it had in a manner begun
he had for his own town residence of bigg house ill with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in asset that he wished her immediately to proceeded
the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took a b his time
they were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority
i don't anticipate
she was young and tried nervous it was a vision of serious duties and little company of really great loneliness
yes but that just the beauty of her passion
it was the beauty of it
its a dull that sounded strange and all the more so because of his nin condition which was
she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that w for a moment disburdened de lighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded
but it was that all her rewards one of the ladies asked
how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became everyday more brilliant and the intelligence that through its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this childe
god as a directed consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonoured bosomed to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally blessed soul in heavens
yet these thoughts affected heer prime less with hope than apprehension
the child had a native grace which does not invariably co exist with thoughtless beauty it's attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very revery garb that precisely became it best
this outward mutability indicated and did not more than fairly expressed the various properties of her inner life
hester could only account for the child's characters and even then most vaguely and imperfectly by recalling which she herself had been during that moment his period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earths
they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind
hester print nevertheless the loving mother of this one childs ran little risk of airing on the side of undue severity
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge
as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that rolled the moment
it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not have questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human childs
beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the childs to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
brooding over all these matters the mother' felt like one who has evoked the spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world
pearls saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance
if spoken to she would not speak again
hester prime wet one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroider to his order and which were to be warned on some great occasion of state bore though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy
another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
at that eh of christine simplicity however matters of even slighter publick interest and a far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and ax of state
the period was hardily if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only cause a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the frame work itself of the legislature
we have spoken of pearl's rich and luxuriant beauty a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depths and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black
it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life
the mother herself as if the redd ignominy were so deeply scorch into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of mor bit ingenuity to create an analogy between the objects of her affection and the emblem of her gilt and torture
but in truth pearl was the one as well as the others and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrive so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance
come therefore and let us s fling mut at them
but pearl who was a daunt was childe after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the not of her enemies and put them all to flight
she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them
it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times
they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were latest windows the wooden shutters to close over them that need
lifting the iron hammer that hung the portal hester print gave a summons which was answered by one of the governor's bond servants a freeborn english man but now a seven years slave
yea has honourable worship is within but he h they godly minister or two with him and likewise ale
ye may not see his worship now
with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentleman of far state in his native land
on the table and token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind stood a large puer tankard at the bottom of which had hester or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draft of ale
little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering front piece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breast plate
mother cried she i see you here luck look
and truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it
pearl accordingly ran to the bow windows at the further end of the hall and looked along the visa of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and emit attempt at shrubbery
but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the et to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening
there were a few rose bushes however an a number of apple trees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mister blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that ha m theological personage who rides though our early annals seated on the back of a bull
pearl seeing the rose bushes began to cry for red rose and would not be pacified
he wore blue silk stockings bloom the pans with gold buckles a blue ruffled wist and a jacket of bright blue braided with gold
his hat had a peaked crown in the flat brim and around the brim with a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved
instead of shoes the old man wore boots with turn over tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold bid
for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of oe in which they lived
when they were outside on simply lathed the door started up the path
no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
at the foot of the mountain separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the gleans the path divided
he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbor
all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unc ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket
then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of doctor piped
uncocked at the door of the house and a chubby pleasant faced woman dressed all them blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile
i am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home
we have come from a fire lonely or place than this o lone or place
and you must be ojo the unlucky she added
oo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life
we are travelling replied ojo and we stopped at your house just to rested in refresh ourselves
the woman seemed thoughtful
and one end stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row all bubbling in steaming at a great rate
it takes me several years to make this magic powder b at this moment i am pleased to say it is nearly done you see i making it for my goodwife mara lot who wants to you some of it for a purpose of her own
you must know said margot when they were all seated together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mam bey the witch who used to leave in the country of vic licence to the north of here
the first lot we tested on our glass hat which not only began to live but has lived ever since
i think the next glass cat and magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and may prove of some use to us
i'm afraid i don't know much about the land device
you see ive lived on all my life without monkey the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything
that is one reason your ojo the unlucky said the woman in sympathetic tone
i think i must show you my patchwork girl said mara lot laughing at the boy's astonishment for she is rather difficult to explain
but first i will tell you that from many years i have longed for his servant to help me with the housework and to cope the melos and wash the dishes
yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose
a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and collars of cloth all neatly so together
sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up
when i founded i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colours would discourage her from tying to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are
at the emerald city where are princess os m lives green is the popular color
i will show you would a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors
ojo examined this curious contrivance with wonder
margot had first made the girl's formed from the patch were quilted and then she had dressed it with a patch work skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same gay material throughout
the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her
the hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat braids
gold is the most common medal in the land of os and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable
no i forgot on about the brains exclaimed the woman
well that may be true agreed margot but on the contrary a servant with too much brains as sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work
she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles
i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in a servant
she ran to her husband side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire
their contents had all a boiled away leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder
very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it altogether in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon
no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
oo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
he selected a small gold bottle with a pepper box top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any objects through the small holes
most people talk too much so it is a relieve to find one who talks too little
i am not allowed to perform magick except for my own amusement he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe with the cook in stem and began to smoke
the ward of oz who used to be a humbug and new no magick at all has been taking lessons of glinda and im told he is getting to be a pretty good wizard but he is nearly the assistant of the great sorceress
it truly is asserted the magician
i now use them as ornamental statuary in my garden

asked the voice in scornful accents

constantine easily believed that the heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation
some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of diocletian and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity
they asserted with confidence and almost with exultation that the apostolical succession was interrupted that all the bishops of europe and asia were infected by the cantation of guilt and schism and that the purgatives of the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the african believers who alone had preserved in violet the integrity of their faith and discipline

the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had dispersed the mists and was sheeting a strong and clear light in the forest when the travelers resumed their journey
after proceeding a few miles the progress of hawkeye who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters
distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinions of ching gutch gr were frequent and earnest
yet here we within a short range of this scones and not a sign of a trail have we crossed

notwithstanding the high resolution of hawkeye he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur
in his return to the camp his acute and practiced intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract to watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of bins asked to speak he was somewhat sceptical on the subjective a bears singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs
there was something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
the ingenious hawkeye who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation

the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very centre of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
for a five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas wary but close observers of the manner of their captive

they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjure to enter
but the bere instead of obeying maintain of the seeded had taken and growled
the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the haint he received they must stand further off
then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place
it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful w
the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
what shall we he do with the mingoes at the door they count six and the singer as good as nothing
the delawares are children of the torte and they outstrip the dear
uncas who had already approached the door and readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
but hawk ey who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself into his companions
so uncas you'd better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
well what can't be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention
as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions
my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy in love returned david a little nettle that so directed and attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgot in my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
if you are not then knocked on the head your being an composer will protect you and you'll then have a good reasons to expect to dieing in your bed
so choose for yourself to make a rush or terry here
bravely and generously as he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service
keep silent as longest made be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will served to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practice myself as one without across a bloods though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
god bless you friend i do believe your sent h not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts in the force of temptation
the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the others features is he afraid
will the hers here his groans
the mo he can started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort
he had no occasioned to delay for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
uncas cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasioned he was in such a state of uncontrolled b agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
without his scrapbooks his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely corrected
i was absent rather more than an hour
the only duplicate which existed so far as as i knew was that which belong to my servant banister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion
the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers
the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together
theyll turned was that someone passing had observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed and a chair will i made a most careful in examination of the room
a broken tip of lad was lying there also
not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dull or clay with spects of something which looks like sawdust in it
above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
to the best of my belief they were rolled up
did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
i was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door open
so it seems to me
now misters at your sposa
above were three students one on each story
then he approached it and standing on tipt with his nat crain he looked into the room
there is no opening except the one paining said our learned guide
i'm afraid there are no signs here said he
one could hardly hope for any upon so dry day
you left him in a chair you say which chair by the window there
the man entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central
as a matter of fact he could not said sums for i entered by the side door
long would a taken to do that using every possible contraction a quarter hour or not less
then he tossed down and seized the next
he was in the midst of that when your returned caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
misters alms was some one overwhelmed by this flood of information
holmes held out a small chip with the letters and e and the space of clear wood after them you see
what's an i have always done you and injustice there are others
i was hoping that if the paper which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polish surface no i see nothing
as holmes drew the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and inertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
hm turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor hullo what is this
homes hat it out on his open palm in the glare of the elector c light
what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
i understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair and are the habit of passing your door yes there are
and they are all in for this examination yes
one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
let us see the suspicions i will look after the proofs
my scholar has been left very ivery poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
the top floor belongs to miles m carn
i dare not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely
he was still suffering from the sudden disturbance of the quiet racin of his life
but have occasionally done the same thing at other times
did you look at these papers on the table
how came you to leave the key in the door
anyone the room could get out yes sir
i really don't thinking knew much about it mister homes
only for a minute or so
oh i would not venture to say sir
you haven't seen any of them no sir
it was the indian whose dark sila appeared suddenly upon his blind
he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
the set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
no names please said hommes as we knocked to gil christ door
of course he did not realize that it was i who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances run her suspicious
that is veryain important said homes
you don't seem to realize the position
to morrow was the examination
i cannot be allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced
it is possible that i may be in apposition then to indicate some course of action
i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings grebe
when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
the fou mouth fellow at the top
he is the one with the worst record
why banister the servant what's his game in the matter
he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man
my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders and half humorous resignation
no good my dear watson
i think so you have formed conclusions
yes my dear watson i have solve the mystery
look at that he held out his hand
on the palm were three little pyramids of black doughy clay
and one more this morning
in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the value scholarship
he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched think hevening that you have come
you know him i thinks so
if this matter is not to become publicly must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court marshal
no sir certainly not
there was no man sir
his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon banister in the farther corner
just close the door said homes
we wanted to know mister gil christ how you and honorable man ever came to commit such an action is that of yesterday
far a moment gil christ with upraised hand tried to control his ringing features
come come said homes kindly it is human to air and at least no one can accuse you of being a cals criminal
well we don't trouble to answer listen and see that i do you know injustice
he could examine the papers in his own office
the indian i also thought nothing of
when i approached your room i examined the window
no one less than that would have a chance
i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table
he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are where with several sharp spikes
no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
he put his shoes on the tablet
gloves said the young man
suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
have i told the truth mister gil christ
i have a letter here mister sums which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night
it will would be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since she were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out
it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you couldn know
if mister sol saw them the game was up
in the debate between the singer societies her defense of the fifteenth the moment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not averse to charleston or newland
john tailor who had supported her through college was interested in cotton
better go he had counsel sententiously
might learn something useful down there
but john is no society just elementary work
then looking up tom's county
fi s and crust wells there big plantations waded it two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
some others too be cotton county
you ought to know john if i teach negros i'll scarcely see much of people in my own class
at any rate i say go
here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused odors and bodily perspiration was to her at times unbearable
she wanted the glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great the lanes in reforms
so for the hundredth time she was thinking to day as she walked alone up the lay back of the barne and then slowly down through the bottoms
cut she posted
she had almost forgotten that it was here within touch in sight
the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her stretching away to the northward
there might be a bit of forte here and there but most of this place was such desperate prose
her regards shifted to the green stalks and leaves again and she started to move away
cotton is a wonderful thing is it not boys she said rather primly
miss tailor did not know much about cotton but at least one more remarked seem called for
don't know well of all things inwardly commented miss tailor letter re boring cotton and o well as much as to ask was the use she turned again to go
i suppose go it too early for them then came the explosion
goo was don't grow on the tops av but on the ground on the rots like yes is that's so
the golden fleece it's the silver fleece he hearkened
sant ae your term me please won't you y you
now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even that she had been talking just talking there were no persons in the conversation just things one thing cotton
the honourable charles smiths ms sara's brother was walking swiftly up town from mister easters wall street office and his face was pale
at last the cotton combine was to all appearances in assured fact and he was slated for the senate
why should he not fee as other men
she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others
as she awaited her guess she survey the tablet with both satisfaction and as quietude for her social functions were few to night there were she cheeked them of on her fingers sir james ceding the rich english manufacturer and lady citing mister in missus van pool mister harry cress well in his sister john tailor and his sister and mister charles smiths whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be u din state senator from new jersey a selection of guest that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of cotton interests earlier in the day
missus grey had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in ma vividly their cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith
she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister crest will express himself so cordially as approving of negro education
do believe in some education asked marry taylor
i believe in the train in of people to the has capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
but crust weel added significantly capacity tiffs en sly between races
the banda pools were sure this and the englishman instanced india became quite eloquent missus grey was mystify but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversations seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharp scrutiny before being allowed much education and as for that low or races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
bos tony heroic added crust well avoiding his sister's eyes
but we nother exactly welcome
mary taylor however related the tale of zag to missus grace private ear later
fortunately said mister ber ful northers and southerners all roving at a bella mutual understanding on most of these matters
he knew the silver flee penza must be ruined
it was the first great sorrowed his life it was not so much the loss of the cotton itself but the fantasy the hopes the dreams built a rounded it
ah the swamp the cruel swamp
the revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly till it flay like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder
he panted to know if she too knew or knew and cared not or cared and knew not
she was strange and human a creature
the worlds was water veiled in mists
then of a sudden that midday the sun shot out hot and still no breth of air stirred the sky was like blue steal the earth steam
where was the use of imagining
the lagoon had been level with the di aw ago and now
perhaps she too might be there waiting weep
he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly
he splashed to stamped along farther and farther onwards until he near the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
then he looked down the lagoon was dry
he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of all of green thick tall wet and willowy
the squares of cotton sharp edged heavy were just about to burst to bulls
or one long moment he paused stupid a gape with utter amazement ban ling dizzily against a tree
he gazed about reflex astonished
here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite working pain someone had dot can now from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by longing and cook way thus allowing it to empty directly
he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost sorra
the years of the days of her dying were ten
the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
up in the sick rooms or a lay on the little white bed
the net and webb of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that stove for her life with ned and creeping fingers but now at last weekly she open her eyes and questioned
for while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at son and bird and tree
she rose were the fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forwards wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
she had been borne within its fs within his board she had lived and groan and within its border she had met her love
on she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island low the cotton lay before her
the chair was empty but he knew
he darted through the trees and paused a tall man strongly but slimily made
it is very fine old place of red brick softened by a peal powdery liken which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bringing the redd brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables the windows and the door place
but the windows are patched with wooden pains and the door i think is like the gate it is never opened
for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shedding with a sonorous bang behind the liber lackey who had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair
a large open fire place with rusty dogs in it and a bear boarded floor at the far end fleeces of wool stacked up in the middle of the floor some empty corn bags
and what through the left hand window
several close horses a pillion a spinning wale and an old box white open and stuffed full of colored rags
at the edge of this box their lies a great wooden all which so far as mutilation is concerned theirs a strong resemblance to the finest greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
the history of the house is plain now
but there is always as stronger sense of life when the son is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beams and making sparkles among the wet straw and lighting up everye patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the count shed and turning even the muy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow build ducks nore seizing the opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it is possible
where the great barn doors are throne white open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendence of mister goby the wid otherwise saddler who entertains them with a latest treadles and gossiped
hey sorrel often took the opportunity when her ann's back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished services for the oak table was usually turned up like a screen and was more for ornament than for use and she could see you herself sometimes in the great round put dishes there were ranged on the shells above the longed deal dinner table's of the great which always shown like jasper
do not suppose however that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish and her appearance she was a good looking woman not more than eight and thirty a of fair complexion and sandy hair well shapen light footed
the family like this between her and her knees dynamos with the contrast between her keenness and dios sirrah gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a martha in mary
her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a damsel came with theer shot seemed to take up an unfinished lecture as a barrel organ takes up a tune precisely at the point where it had left off
the fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the widows and why consequently missus poy should scold molly the housemaid with unusual severity
to while appearance molly had got through her after inner work in an exemplary manner had cleaned herself with great dispatch and now came to ask submissively if she should sit down to her spinning t milking time
spinning indeedy
i never new your equals for callousness
who taught you d to scribble floor i should like to know
comb the wolf for the wows indeed
that's what you'd like to be dinging is it
that's the way with you that's the ro you all like to go head longs to ruin
mister out lees indeed
you are rare per sitting down to your work a little while after its time to put by
money my ands tight told these put it down to warm
cold as it my darling bless your sweet face
she's going to put the ironing things away
money i did like to do into the barn to ty to see the widow
no no no totty get her feet wet said missus poyser carrying away her ion
did ever anybody see the like screamed missus poyser running towards the table when her eye had fallen on the blue stream
puy however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run and an amount of fat on the nepe of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig
and she was very found of you two lunt rachel
i often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way
when had that ban illness and i was only eleven years old she used to say you'll have a friend on earths in your aunt rachel if i'm taken from you for she has a kind heart and i'm sure i've found it so
and there's linen in the house as i could well spare you for i got lots a sheeting and table clothing and twinges isn't made up
but not more than whats in the bible and said dinah
nay dear and you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work in their families
we can all be servants of god wherever our lot is cast but he gives us different sorts of work according as he fits us for it and calls us to it
i can no more help spending my life and trying to do what i can for the souls of others then you could help running if you heard little totty crying at the other end of the house the voice would go too your heart you would think the dear child was in trouble or danger and you couldn't rest without running to helper and comfort her
i've strong assurance that no evil will haven't you and my uncle in the children for anything i have done
i didn't preach without direction
direction
i had a common patience with you
by this time the two gentleman had reached the palings and had got down from their horses it was playing they meant to come in
said mister irwine with his stately cordiality
oh sir don't mention it said missus poyser
i don light in your kitchen
poyser is not at homey
said captain dy thorn sitting himself where he gould see along the short passage to the open derry door
no sir he isn't he's gone to rossiter to see mister west the factor about the wall
but there's father in barn sir if he'd be of any use
no thank you i'll just look at the wealths and leave a message about them with your shepherd
i must come another day and see your husband i want to have a consultation with him about horses
for if is anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute
oh sir said missus poyser rather alarmed you wouldn't like it at all
but you know more about that that i dose sir
i think ike should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place
i knows farm is in better order than any other within ten miles of us and as for the kitchen he added smiling i don't believe theres one in the kingdom to beat it
by the by i've never see your dairy i must se your dy missus poyser
this missus poyser said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her mok pans and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of her derry
oh i've no doubts and capital order
the paris plant like that at the crystal palace was a temporary exhibit
the london plat was less temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings in the vicinity of holborn bo
there mess e's johnson and hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told
the dio electric machine though small was robust for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine seventeen years
owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current
why if we erected station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city
there seems no good reason for believing that it will change
brad the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them he is ii sin chronically oppose to loose and wasteful methods to plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate
everything he has done has been aimed that the conservation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against its seriously
it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could charge storage batteries all of which are easily within thea ability of the d recurrent
but when it came to be a questioned of lighting a scattered sub a group of dwellings on the outskirts a rem country residence or a farm mouse the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and is ideal
edison was intolerant of sham and shot and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope test tube and galvanometer
unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governed regulated the those vial for his dio and lamp edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light
mister edison was a leader far a he of the time
he obtained the desired speeded and load with a friction b also regulator of speeded but waited for an indicator a verify it
then again there was no known way to lubricate and engine for continuous running and mister edison and form me that amen engine started before the ship left ne york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine for his purposes must produced light at all times
edison had installed his historic first great central station system in new york on the multiple arch system covered by his feeder and made invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight too wire system thwough out of the tree kind
he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact district of large cities
the strong positions held by the edison system under the strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and he gave an immediate impis to incandescent lighting
it was specially suited for a trial plat also in the early days when a yielded six eight lamps to the horse power was consider subject for congratulation
the street conductors were of the overhead whole line construction aw installed by the construction company that had been organized by en to build an equipped central stations
meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wire system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent and vents at practically the same time
i think he was perhaps more appreciative that i was of the discipline of the edison construction to pardon and fat it would be well for us to wait until the morning the fourth before we started up
but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country
they were later used as reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of a sonia but they remained in practically as good condition as one installed in eighteen e e three
the arch lamp and stalled outside a customers premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many knights in the months and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate f hours when the lamp might be out through accident
ev sin held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter
there was infinite skepticism around him on the subjects and while other invents were also giving the subject bere thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact pointed use could not be brought to accurate registration
hence the edison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
the principle employed in the edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to de compose a chemical substance
associated with the simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from in accuracy and imitate from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
the standard edison neither practice was to remove the sells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another sat being substituted
in december eighteen eighty eight mister due j jenks red an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any others
the others having been an operation too short at time to showed definite results although they also went quickly to a dien basis
in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effects that the edison meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best fatal results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter
the meet continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century
he weighed and rew the meter plates and pursued everye line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
the problem was sobbed
we were more interested in the technical conditions of the station than in the commercial part
we had maders in which there were two bottles of liquidate
here she would stay comforted ands among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turner the gardener who since polly's first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
every chance she could steel after practice hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
then dear said missus whitney you must be kindly to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home evening among brands
somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear at no longer
if she could only see phronsie for just one moment
oh she's always at the piano said van she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
at this the bundle open suddenly and out popped phronsie
but polly couldn't speak and of jasper hadn't caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool phronsie and all
asked phronsie with her little face close to polly's own
now you'll stay cried man say polly won't you
oh you are the dearest and best mister king i ever saw but how did you make mammy let her come
isn't he splendid cried jasper and intense pride swelling up father knew how to do it
there there he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head
i know gasped polly controlling her sobs i won't only i can't thank you
asked phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of polly's arms and crowding up close to jasper side
yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop there laughing he did now truly pansy
o no chapter i must go by my veryain ow self
there jap you've caught it lapped percy while the others screamed at the side of jasper's face
don't mind it polly whispered jasper twasn't her fault
dear me ejaculated the old gentlemen in the utmost amazement and such a time as i've had to get her here too
how did her mother ever let her go
she asked impulsively i didn't believe you could persuade her father
i didn't p any fear as if i worked to rightly said the old gentleman complacently
he cried and high dugs just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose at them all the sooth his fancy
and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had the burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time
at last he came out them and wiped his face vigorously
it is sixteen years since john berks and died
his wife now lies beside him and the whit shaft that marks their graves gleams across the heat fields
from the nor region graveyard one looks out over a vast checker board marked off in squares of wheat and corne light and dark dark and light
from the grave yard gate one can count dozen gaily painted farmhouses the gilded weather veins on the big red barns wink g each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
the air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the others
he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy grey eyes deeply set under serious brow
that's not much of a job for an outlet here i've been to town and back
alexander that you sleep late
she gathered up her reins
please wait for me mary a il coaxed
i never see lose sighed over here
how brown you've got since you came home i wish i had an' ale to mow my orchard
i get wet to my knees when i go down to pick cherries
indeed he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it
they think your proud because you've been away to school are something
there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail
on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall o sage or inde their glossy green mocking off the yellow fields
any one there about would have told you that this was one of her richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra bergs and
there is evening a white row of be hives and the orchard under the wallet trees
frank red english slowly and the more he read aboute boar's case the angrier he grew
marie sighed
a brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky
the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
that invitation decided her
o but i'm glad to get this place mode
just smell the wild roses they are all ways so spicy after a rain
we never had so many of them men here before
i suppose it's the wet season will you've have to cut them too
i said those that's the wet season too them
if exciting to see everything growing so fast and to get the grass cut
aren't you splashed look up a spider whips all over the grass
in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pale and he began to swinging his side with that longing even stroke that few american boys ever learn
mer picked cherries and saying softly to herself stripping one glittering ranch after another shivering when she thought a shower of rain drops on her neck and hair
and amal mow his way slowly down toward the jerry trees
that summer the reins had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than chivato and his man could do to keep up with the corn the orchard was an neglected wilderness
i don't know all at them but i know bons
if i feel that way i feel that way
he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit longing ivory colored berries tipped with main pink like white coral that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through
he dropped a handful into her lap
yes don't you
oh ever so much only you seems kind of stay it and school tether
when she used to tell me about him i always wondered whether she wasn't heru little lan love with him
it would serve you all right if she walked off with carl
i liked to talk to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there
oh am mel
surely you are not thinking of going of there
mar's face foul under his brooding gaze
i'm sure a sender hopes you will stay on here she murmured
i don't not to stand around of look
i want to be doing something on my own account
sometimes i don't want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the four corners of the divide together he threw out his arm and brought it bach with a jerk so like a tablecloth
i get tired of seeing man and horses going up and down up and down
i wish you weren so restless and didn't get so worked up over things she said sadly
thank you he returned a shortly
and you never used to be cross to me
i can't play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly that's what you miss mary
but am if i understand then are good times are over we can never do nice things together any more
and anyhow there's nothing too understand
that mon last it will go away and things will be just as they used to
i pray for you but that not the same as if you pray yourself
i can't pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i wal pray not to have them not if i'm damped for it
then all our good times are over
saturday august fifteenth the sea and broken all round no land in sight
the horizon seems extremely distant
all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am well his nature has resumed it sway
you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye angus
one might be would less reason th now
i am not complaining that the ra is slow but that the sea iss so wide
we are rising time and the fact iss i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft
he called the sea upon and i longed wage ticking a little sale
therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects
i take this is my answer and i leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience
sunday august sixteenth
nothing knew whether unchanged the wind freshens
but there seem no reason of fear
the shadow of the waft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
truly v sea is of infinite w
it must be wide as the mediterranean or they atlantic and why night
these thoughts agitated me all day in my imagination scarcely calm down after several our sleeve
i shudder as i recalled these monsters to my remember
i saw at the hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length
i suppose professor leading brock was of my opinions too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pick his eyes travers ocean from side to side
tuesday august eighteenth
during his watch i slept
two hours afterwards a terrible shark a woe me
the raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again had a distance of twenty fathoms
there's a whale a well cried the professor
fight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they willed around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains
two masters only were creating all this commotion and be for my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world
i could distinguish the eye of eta source glowing like a red hot co and as large as a man's head
its jaw is enormous and according the naturalist it ar with no less than one hundreds and eighty two teeth
those huge creatures attack each other with a greatest animosity
suddenly theta sis and the plus source disappear below leaving warp eddying in the water
as for the if the source h he returned whose submarine cavern
the roarings become lost in the distance
the weather if we may use the term will change before law
the atmosphere is charged with vapors pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of sailing waters
the electric light can scarcely penetrate to the dance curt which is dropped over the theatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged
the air is heavy the sea is calm
from time the time a fleecy tuft of miss we yet some gleaming light left upon it drops down upon the dense floor of grey and loses itself in the opake and impenetrable mass
the atmosphere as evidently charged and sir charged with electricity
the wind never lolls but to acquire increase strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge res of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms
there's a heavy storm coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon
those cloud seem as if they were going to crushed the sea
on the mast already i see the light play of lament saint ev's fire the out stretch sill catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lad
but if we have now ceased to advance why do weet leave that sail loose which at the first shock of a tempest may cap sis us in a moment
that will be the safest no no neber
the piled up vapours contents ino water and the air put ino violent action to supply the bacon left by the condensation of the mist rouses itself into a whirlwind
harm stirs night
from the under surface of the clouds there are continual omissions of lurid l electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules the gashes elements of the air need to be slaved with moisture for innumerable columns of water rushed upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam
i referred to the the homer it ino cates a figure is obliterated
is the atmosphere conditioning having once reached density to become final
the raft bears on still to the south east
at noon the violence of the storm re doubles
each of us is lashed to some part of the raft
the waves rise above our heads
they seemed to be we are lost but i am not sure
he nods his concept
the farre ball half of it wye half azara blue and the size of the ten in shell move solely about the raft but revolving on its own axis with astonishing philos as if whip round by the force of the whirl winded
here it comes there it glides now is up the ragged stump of the mast thats it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just skins the powder magi horrible
we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disc of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches hans who fixes his blue eye upon its sadly it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it
a suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air it inns the throat it fills longs
we suffer stifling pains
and how odd the directions were look
poor alice
it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed the pair white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting long and a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess
oh what she be savage if i'd kept her waiting
alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was veryain hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on a talking dear dear how queer everything is to day
and yesterday thinks w on just as usual
i wonder if i've been changed in the night
i almost i can remember feeling a little different
i'll try if id know all the things i used to know
i shall never get to twenty at that rate
how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws
no i've made it my mind about it if im mab i'll stay down here
it'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear
i'm so very tired a being all alone here
and i declare it's too bad that it is
i wish i hadn't cried so much said alice as she swim about trying to find her way out
i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drown in my own tears
that will be a queer thing to be sure
i am very tired to swimming about here oh mouse
cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
we won't talk about her any more if he'd rather no we indeedy
we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
the conditions that i will be permitted to make luther talk american stream line him so to speak because youll never get people whether in or are outside the luther and church actually to read luther unless me make him talk as he would talk to day to americans
let us begin with that his commentary on glass
the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as literary tasks proved the most difficult one and at times became oppressive
it was written in and latin
the word had to be condensed
a word should now be set about the origin of luthers common togs
much later when a friend of his was preparing an addition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine m delights for instance and
in other words these three men took down the lectures which luted address to ensor of glass and roar prepared the man scrip for the printer
it presents like no other of luthers writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of chris merits alone
but the essence of luther's lectures is there
the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do luke too
the word of our god shall stand forever
in every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint paul
they said to the relations you have no right to think highly of paul
he was the last to turned to christ
pal cum later in his beneath us
indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
do you suppose that god for the sake of a few mutter inherits would dis his entire church
against these boasting false apostles paul boldly defends his apostolic authority in ministry
as the ambassador of a government is honoured for his office and not for his private person so the minister of christ should exalt his office in order to again authority among men
paul takes pride his ministry not to his own phase but to the praise of god
paul and apostle not of men et cetera
either he calls ministers to the agency of men or he calls them directly as he called the profits and apostles
paul declares that the false apostles were caled sent neither by men nor by man
the most they could claim is that they were sent by others
he mentions the apostles first because they were pointed directly by god
the call was not to be taken lightly
for person of possess knowledge is not enough
is spoils one's best work
when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his call
i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
i know nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were ted sophistry instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
this is no sinful pride it is holy pride
and god the father who raised him from the dead
the classe super on first sight
these perverts of the rightness of christ resist the father and the sun and the works of them both
in this whole epistle paul treats of the resurrection of christ
by his resurrection christ one the victory over law sin flesh whirl devil death hell and everye evil
first two
and all the brethren which are with me
that you go far and shutting the mouse of the false of posies
although the brethren with me your not apostles like myself yet they all of one mind with me think right and teach i do
they do not go with the enemies of the gospel predominate they go with the questions are
why d they not invaded the catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to god this princes bishops and doctors as we have them by the help of god
we look for that rewards which i hath not seen nor ear heard neither hat entered into the heart of man
not all the relations had become perverted
these means cannot be continent
they remained divine regardless of men' opinions
wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church even th ante chris rings there
so much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the apostle verse three
grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
the terms of grace and piece are common terms with paul and are now pretty well understood
the greeting of the apostles refreshing
grace and vs the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
the world brands this of pernicious doctrine
experience profess
however the grace and piece of god will
men should not speculate about the nature of god
was it not enough to say from god the father
to do so as to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure to comprehend his infinite majesty
he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him
embrace him and forget about the nature of god
did not christ himself say i am the way in the truth in the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
when you are you about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like
we are to hear christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher
at the same time pal confirms are creed that christ is very ivery god
that christ is very god is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the fathers as for instance the power to the spens grace and peace
to bestow piecing grace lies in the province of god who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot
otherwise pall should have written grace from god the fathers and peace from my lord jesus christ
the arians took ce for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth
mohammed also speedily of christ
pasts to theme
he never loses sid of the purpose of his epistle
not gold or silver or passion lambs or an angel but himself what f
not for a crown or a kingdom were a goodness before sins
under score these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences
how may we obtain remission of our sins
pincers the man who his name jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for a sinse
since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by own efforts
this sentence also to fines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin
the greatness of the ransom christs some of god indicates this
the vicious characters of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for a sins
but we are careless we make light of sin
we think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss
this passage then theres out the fact that all man are solder sin
this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin as a small matter easily taken care of by good works but we must present our sells them to god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sins
this attitude is universal in particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
on the other hand we are not to regard them is so terrible that we must despair

the influence which the taus has exercised the upon pasty is due partly to a misunderstanding
in the suppose depths of this dio the neal platonists founded hidden meanings in connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quiet at variance with the spirit of plato
they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly correct stick in him his aft realize in connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
there is no danger of the modern come taters on the tabus falling unto the absurdities of the neo plants
in the present day we are well awar that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
the fancies of the new platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a thae of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian ea and is not hoy extinct in our own day
but they have nothing to do with the invitation of plato and in spirit they are opposed to him
we do not know how plata would have arranged his ow dials were whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the t trilogy which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
the d lop is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this t the heavily bodies and with man only as one among the animals
but he has not as yet the fin this an immediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in winking furies of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
with heroes he acknowledges the perpetual flux like antar he assert the predominance of mine although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pier gar ands he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
many if not all the elements of the pre socratic philosophy are included in the tus
it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
the style and plein of the tus differ greatly from that of any other of the plutonic dialogs
but plato has not the same mystery over his instrument which he exhibits in the features or sposa
nothing can exceeded the beauty are are d introduction in which his using words after his accustomed manner
but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
he could wave in one style but not in another in the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the tares of plato which characterises the philosophical poor of the cati
there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs and plays earlier writings
plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art

but already at point in economic evolution far an stating the emergence of the lady specialized consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had began to work out in a moral less librate system
the utility of consumptions as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a gervais of growth
such consumptions false to the women is merely incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labour and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fullness of life
with a further advance and culture this tib may changed into simple custom of a mor oral less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a bo or large to conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class
under the tobe certain victuals and more pet clearly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the f use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become uff as being a mark at the second remove of the superior states of those who are able to afford the indulgence
it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
with many qualifications with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradual weakened the general ru is fell to be right and binding that woman should consume only for the benefit of their masters
the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this ru but it will appearing the sequel that this exception is much more obvious and substantial
the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conly reality and religion these motives are also present in the later development that they do not continued to be the sol motives
there is a moralist elaborate system of ranking grates
this differentiation is further by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are the same time lessen of substance in their own right so that some of them a scarce let all others only partially to beated as my carries consumers
so many of them however as makee the retainer and hangs on of the patron may be classed as v carriest consumer without qualification
many of these again and also many of the other stops of lest degree having turned attached to the persons a more or less comprehensive group of i cars consumer in the persons of their wives and children their servants retainers et cetera
the wearing of uniforms a liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and m even be said to be a mark of servitude real ostensible
the wearers of uniforms and liveries may be recall divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble
that the general distinction is not on that a count to be overlooked
so those offices which are by wight the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and acumen and the like in short those which may be class as ostensibly predatory employments
i ever as in these cases the mal service in questions has to do directly with a primly leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected honorific character
their livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it
in a general way though not wholly or consistently these two groups coin sight
the dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in the late to development of the institution when the member of persons by whom these duty customarily performed gradual and narrows the wife remains the last
but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of r cars leisure in consumption devolve upon the wife alone
in the communities of the weston culture this point is a present found among the lower middle class
if beauty comfort achieved and it is moralist for tutor circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economical of voiced effort
the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeedy commonly does that with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slams the man and presently also the children virtual seized to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the soul exponent of the household's pecuniary decency
very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decencies put away
there is no class and no country that as yielded so objective before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need
the question which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to effects
each will there for serve about equally well ding the earner stages of social growth
the modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line
it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
he dis also noticeable that the serves ability consumptions a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is that its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individuals widest and the mobility of the populations greatest
consumption becomes a larger element in the stander of living in the city th in the country
among the country population its places to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighbour gossips sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute
the resulted is a great nobility of the labor employing printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well define and considerable body of workmen
under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expected find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset
but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came told the rank firmer above wasteful consumption of goods both as it direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the course i peaceable culture
are the circumstance permitting that instinct disposes meant to look with favour upon productive efficiency and on what ev is of humans
a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is affected by resort to make believe menin intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations founded with some specious object of emulation and boded in their official sty u title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the talkers may not have occasioned to reflect on what is the effectual economic valley of their traffic
the silent features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
throughout the entire revolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of good sir of services or human life runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually men the consume good fain it must be an expenses per flutes
as use in the speech of everyday life the word carries and undertone of deprecation
the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by consumer under this cannon of conspicuous wast
but it is another grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of every day life implies deprecation of what is characterize their wistful
in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
an article may useful and wasteful both and it silt it to consumer may be made up of use u waste in the most faring proportions

a good neighbour of the brons a clever intelligent yorkshire woman who keeps drugged shop and haw worthing from her occupation her experience and excellent sense holds the position of village doctors and nurse and as such has been a friend in many time of trial and sickness and death in the household drowned told me a characteristic little incident connected with tabby fracture leg
tabby had lived with them for tenor twelve years and was as charlotte expressed it one of the family
he refused at first to listen to the careful advice it was repugnant to his liberal nature
this decision was communicated to the girls
tabby had tended them in their childhood they and none other should tend her in her infirmity in age
at te time they were sad and silent and the meal went away untouched by any of the three
she had another weight on her mind this christmas
but anne had began to suve just before the holidays and charlotte watched over her younger sisters with the jellous vigilance of some wild creature that changes her veryain nature if danger threatens her young
stung by anxiety for this little sister she upbraided mist for her fancied indifference to an state of health
still her heart had received a shock in the perception the van's delicacy and all these holiday she watched over her with the longing fawn anxiety which a so full of sudden pangs of fear
i doubt whether branwell was maintaining himself at this time
to celebrate the arrival of her son sylvia gave a splendid supper to which she had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance
without saying it positively she made me understand that being herself and illustrious member of the republic of letters she was well aware that she was speaking to and insect
in order to please her i spoke to her of the abbey conti and i had occasioned to quote two lines of that profound writer
madame corrected me with a patronising air for by pronunciation of the word scare which means divided saying that it ought to be pronounced secure and she added that i ought to be veryain glad to have learned so much on the first day of my arrival in paris telling me that it would be an important day in my life
her face was in enigma for inspired everyone with the warmest sympathy and yet if you examined it attentively there was not one beautiful feature she could not be call handsome but no one couldn have thought her ugly
sylvia was the adoration of france and her talent was the real support of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her especially of the plays of marya v for without her his comedies would never have gone to prosy
sylvia did not think that her good conduct was a merit for she knew that she was virtuous only because her self love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority towards her theatrical sisters although satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue
two years before her death i saw her performed the characters of mary anne in the comedy of mara and in spite of her age and declining health the illusions was complete
she was honorably buried in the church of saints without the slightest opposition from the venerable priest who far from sharing the ant christian intolerance of the clergy and general said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good christian and at the earths was a common mothers of all human beings as jesus christ had been the saviour of all mankind
you will forgive me dear reader if i have made you attend the funeral sylvia ten years before her death believe me i have no intention of performing a miracle you may console yourself with the idea that i shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor sylvia dies
i never had any family
i had a name i believe in my young days but i have forgotten it since i have been in service
i shall call you spree

i see a quantity of chairs for higher at the rate of one sou men reading the newspaper under the shade of the trees girls and men breakfasting either alone lore in company waiters who were rapidly going up and down a narrow staircase hidden under the foliage
i sit down in a small table a waiter comes immediately to inquire my wishes
i toll to give me some coffee if it is good
then turning towards me he says that i looked like a foreigner and when i say that i am an italian heat begins to speak to me of the cour the city of the theatres and at last he officers to accompany me everywhere
i think him and take my leave
i address him in italian and he answers veryain wittily but his way of speaking makes me smile and i tell him why
my remark pleases him but i soon proved to him that it does not the right way to speak however perfects may have been the language of th ancient writer
i see a crowd in one corner of the garden everybody standing still on looking up
is not a marian everywhere
yes but the midian of the pal roy is the most exacted
that is true bad deil gree
all these honest persons are waiting their turned to get their snuff boxes filled
it is sold everywhere but for the last three weeks nobody will use any snuff but that sold at the save cat
is't better of th anywhere else
but how did she managed to render it so fashionable
simply by stopping her carriage two or three times before the shop to have her s enough box filled and by saying allow to the young girl who handed back the box that h sen was the very best in paris
you are now in the only country the world where wit can make a fortune by selling either a genuine or a false article in the first case it receives the welch of intelligent and talented people and in the second fools are always ready to rewarded for silliness is truly a characteristic of the people here and however wonderful it may appear silliness is the daughter of w
let a man run and everybody will run after him the crowder will not stop unless the man is proved to be mad but to prove it is indeed the difficult task because we have a crowd of men who mad from their births are still considered wise
it seems to me i replied at such approval such ratification of the opinions expressed by the king the princes of the blooded cetera is rather proof of the affection felt for them by the nation for the french carry that affection to such an extent that they believe them infallible
when the king comes to paris everybody calls out vie the l roy
she introduced me to all her guests and gave me some particulars respecting everyone of them
what sour i said to him a my fortunate enough to see you
he him self recited the same passage in french and politely pointed out the parts in which he thought that i had improved on the original
for the first day sir i think that what you have done gives great hopes of you and without any doubt you will make rapid progress
i believe it sir and that is what i fear therefore the principal objective my visit here is to devotee myself entirely to the study of the french language
i am a veryain unpleasant pupil always asking questions curious troublesome insatiable and even supposing that i couldn't meet with the teacher i require i am afraid i have not rich enough to bay him

he had a good appetite cell a good' story without laughing was celebrated for his why re bayes and his sociable manners but he spent his life at home seldom going out and seeing hartly anyone because he always had a pipe in his mouth and was surrounded by at least twenty cats with which he would amuse himself all day
his housekeeper had the management of everything she never allowed him to be in needed of anything and she gave no account of his money which she kept altogether because he never asked her to render any accounts
on the sixth of april eighteen thirty the church of jesus christ of latter day saints was formerly organized and thus took on a legal existence
its origin with small adjourn an insignificant seeded hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse oppositions
in set of but six regularly affiliated members and at most two score of adherents the organization numbers today many hundred thousands souls
in place up a single hamlet in the smallest corner of which the members could have congregated there now are about seventy stakes of sign and about seven hundred organized words each ward and stake with its full compliment of officers and priested organizations
the practice of gathering its prose lite into one place prevents the billing up and strengthening of foreign branches and in as much as extensive and strong organizations are seldom met with abroad veryain erroneous ideas exist concerning the strength of the church
nevertheless the mustard seed among the smallest of all seats hes attained the proportions of a tree and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches the acorne is now in oak offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way for truth
their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sum not merely that the work of pros lading should be carried on in the west but that the headquarters of the church should be there established
the bookman had taught the people the true origin and destiny of the american indians and towards this dark skinned remnant of a once mighty people the missionaries of mormonism early turned their eyes and with their eyes went their hearts and their hopes
it is notable that the indian tribes have grey regarded their religion of the latter day saints with favor seeing in the book a mormon striking agreement with their own traditions
the first well establish seat of the church was in the pretty little town of courland ohio almost within sight of like eery in here soon rose the first temple of modern times
to the fervent latter day saint a temple is not simply eight church building a house for religious assembly
soon thousands of converts had rented or purchase homes in misery independence jackson counting being their center but from the first they were unpopular among the meran's
the lieutenant governor lilburn bogs afterward governor was a pronounced mormon hater and throughout the period of the troubles he men if h is sympathy with the persecutors
their sufferings have never yet been fitly chronicled by human scribe
making the way across the river most of the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of clay county and afterward established themselves in called well county therein founding the city of far west
a small settlement had been founded by mormon families u show creek and here on the thirtieth of october eighteen thirty eight accompany of two hundred and forty fell upon the hapless settlers and butcher a score
be its to the honor of some of the officers intrusted with a terrible commission that when they learned its true significance they resign their authority rather than have anything to do with what they designated a cold blooded butchery
oh what a record to read what a picture de gaze upon how awful the fact
american schoolboys read with emotions of horror of the albigenses driven beaten and killed with a pappa legate directing the butchery and of the tho hunted and hounded like beasts as the effective a royal decree and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice an inhuman hate
who began the quarrel was at the mormons
as the dabble of the press comments against the brutality of the meran's i quote a paragraph from the quincy argus march sixteenths eighteen thirty nine
it will be observed that an organized mob aided by many of the civil and military officers of misery with governor bogs at their head have been the prominent actors in this business incited too it appears against the mormons by political hatred and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge
the army sound the people in poverty and left them in comparative wealth
but awd further concerning the expedition in general
it was through floors advice the became and order the military expedition to utah ostensibly to install certain federal officials and too repress and alledging infant billion which in fact had never come into existence but in reality to further the entreats of this secessions
moreover had the people been inclined to rebellion while greater opportunity could they have wished
already and north and the south were talk of one onst set up also a west
they knew no north no south no east no west they stood positively by the constitution and would of nothing to do in the bloody strife between brothers unless indeed they were summoned by the authority too which they had already once loi responded to furnish men and arms for the countries need
what the latter a saints call celestial marriage his characteristic up the church and is in very general practice but of celestial marriage plurality of wives was an incident never an essential
we believe in a literal resurrection and an actual hereafter in with future state shall be recognized every sang defined authorize relationship existing here on earths of par and childe brother and sister husband and wife
it has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands to observe the customs and study the habits of more nations that one and i've yet to finde the place and meet to people wearing with whom the purity of man and woman is held more precious than among them mind moments in the mountain valleys of the west
at the inception of barrel marriage among the latter day saints there was no law national or state against its practice
in eighteen sixty two a law was enacted with a purpose of suppressing coral marriage and as had been predicted in the national senate prayer to its passage and lay for many years a dead letter
fold judges and united states attorneys and utah who were not mormons nor lovers and warm ism refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law because of its manifest injustice and inadequacy
this meant that for an a ledge mis de meaner for which congress prescribed a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and a fine of three hundred dollars a man might the imprison for life i for many terms of a man's natural life did the courts power to enforce its sentences extend so far and might be find millions of dollars
before this travesty on the administration of law could be brought before the court of last resort and there met with the reversal and rebuke it deserved m where imprisoned under sentence of many years duration
the people contested these measures one by one in the courts presenting in case after case the different phases of the subjects and urging unconstitutional dy of the measure
than the church was disan carp rated and its property both real and personal confiscated and eat to the government of the united states and although that personal property was soon restored realestate of great value long laying the hands of the courts receiver and the mormon church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property
and so the story mormonism runs on its finally has not yet been written the current pressed presents continuously news stages of its progress new developments of its plan
main home like alexander because he was an engineer
he had preceded ideas about everything and his idea about americans was that they should be engineers on mechanics
it's tremendously well put on too
it's been on only tow weeks and i've been ha a dozen times already

i say sir harry the little girls going famously ton isn't she
you know i thought the dance of b conscious to night for the first time
west mere and i were back after the first act and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself
a little attack of nerves possibly
he was beginning to feel keen interest in the slender be afoot donkey girl who slipped an and out of the play singing like some one winding through hilly field
one night when he winifred was sitting together on the bridge he told her the things had happened while he studding abroad that he was sorry for one thing in particular and he asked her whether she thought she ought tok know about them
she considered for a moment im it no i think not the way i'm glad you ask me
after that it was easy to forget actually to forget
of course he reflected she always had that combination of something homely insensible and something utterly wild and daft
she must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to
from glad shes held her oom since
after all we were awfully young
i shouldn't wonder if she could laugh about it with me now
hilda was veryain nice to him and he sat on the edge of his chair flushed with his conversational efforts and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar
they asked him to come to see them in chelsey and they spoke very tenderly of hilda
lamb wouldn't car a great deal about many of them i fancy
when bartle arrived at bedford square on sunday evening mar the pretty little french girl met him at the door and conducted him upstairs
i should never have asked you if molly had been here for i remember you don't like english cookery
i haven't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place i think this is
they are all sketches mead about the villa des you see
those fellows are all very loyal even maine hall
i've managed to save something every year and that with helping my three sisters now and then and tiding poor cousin makee over bad seasons
it's not particularly rare she said but son of it was my mothers
there was wer christs soup and soul and a delightful oleo stuff with mushrooms and truffles and two small rare ducklings and art a chokes and a dry yellow ran wine of which barley had always been very fond

have you been in paris much these lay ears
there are few changes in the old quarter
don't i though i'm so sorry to hear it how did her son turn out
her hair still like flax and her blue eyes are just like a babies and she has the same three freckles on her little nose and talks about going back to bandon air
how jolly it was being young hilda
do you remember that first walk we took together in paris
come well have our coffee the other room and you can smoke
i think we dids she answered to merely
what she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs but just our youth
they were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money god give you a happy love
the strange woman and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply had frightened them both
barley started when held rang a little bell beside her dear me why did you do that
it was veryain jolly he murmured lazily as mar came and to take away the coffee
have i told you about my knew play
when she finished alexander shook himself out of a reverie
nonsense of course i can't really saying except the way my mother and grandmother did before me
it's really too warm in this room to saying don't you feel it
alexander went over and opened the window for her
there just in front
he stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said it's soft and misty see how white the stars are
for a long time either hild nor bartle spoke
he felt a tremor run through slender yellow figure and front of him
bartle lean over her shoulder without touching her and whispered in her ear you are giving me a chance yes
alexander clenched the two hands at his sides
the stopped queen's town the tedious passage up the mercy were things that he noticed dimly through his growing impatience
she blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in or confusion before she ran upstairs
alexander paced up and down the hallway but ning and unbuttoning his overcoat until she returned and took him up to hill his living room
the room was empty when he entered
alexander did not set down
i felt it in my bones when i woke the s morning that something splendid was going to turn up
i thought it might be sister kater cousin might would be happening longer
she pushed him towards the bigg chair by the fire and sat down on a stool of the opposite side of the hearth her knees drawn up to her chin laughing like a happy little girl
when d you come bartle and how it it happen you haven't spoken a word
i got in about ten minutes ago
alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze
bartle bent lowered over the fire
she looked at his heavy shoulders and bigg determined head fust forward like a catapult and leach
i'll do anything you wish me too bartle she said tremulously
i can't stamp seeing you miserable
he pulled up a windows if the air were heavy
hill to watched him from the corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes it
but it's worse now it's unbearable
i get nothing but misery out of either
the world is all there just as it used to be but i can't get added anymore
it was myself i was defying helder
hell this face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been
but why didn't you tell mee when you were hear in the summer
alexander grounded i meant to but somehow i couldn't
she pressed his hand gently in gratitude

she closed you her eyes and took a deep breath as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days
he moved uneasily and his chair crete

you seep loving someone as i love you makes the whole world different
and then you came back not carrying veryain much but it made no difference
barley bent over and took her in his arms kissing her mouth and her wet tired eyes

with tortured each other enough for to night
chapter one origin

thus i don't miss the mothers

what is slang
we have never understood this sort of objections
slang is odious
slang makes one shudder
who denied that of course it does
when it is a questions of probing a wound a gul a society since when has it been considered wrong to go too far to go to the bottom
we have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and at least a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attentions which duty accepted in fulfilled merits
why should one not explore everything and study everything
why should one halt on the way
nothings is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang
now when has horror ever excluded study
since when has malady banished medicine
can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper the bat the scorpion the centipede the tula and one who which cast than back into their darkness saying oh how ugly that is
he would be like a philologist refusing to examine e fact in language if philosopher hesitating to scrutinizes e act in humanity
what is slaying properly speaking
it is the language of wretchedness
we may be stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms which is one way of attenuating it we may be told that al trades professions it may be added all the accidents of the social higher achan all forms of intelligence have their own slight
the painter who says my grinder the notary who says my skip the gutter the hair dresser who says my merely back the cobler who says my cub talks slang
there is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the press uses
the sugar manufacturer who says loaf clarified lumps base common burnt this honest manufacturer talk slang
algebra medicine bony have each their sang
to meet the needs of this conflict wretchedness has invented a language of combat which is slang
to keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion to hold above the gul were it but a fragment of some language which men has spoken and which would otherwise be lost that is to say one of the elements good or bad of which civilization is composed or by which it is complicated to extend the records of social observation is to serve civilization itself
phoenician very good
even dialect let that pass
to this we reply in one word only
assuredly if the tongue which nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study
and then we insist upon it the study of social deformities and infirmities and the task of pointing them out with the view to remedy is not a business in which choices permitted
he must descend with his heart full of charity and severity at the same time as a brother and as a judge too those impenetrable casemates where crawl pell now those you bleed in those who deal the blow those who weep in those who curs those who fast in those who devour those who had door evil and those who inflicted
do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern
they constitute to different orders of facts which corresponded to each other which are always into laced and which often bring forth results
true history being a mixture of all things the true historian mingles in everything
facts form one of these and ideas the other
there it clothes itself in word masks in mah rags
in this guise it becomes horrible
one perceives without understanding it a hideous murmur sounding almost like human ace but more nearly resembling a howl than inarticulate word
one thinks one year's hi dress talking
it is unintelligible in the dark
it is black in misfortune it is blacker still when crime these two blackness is amalgamated compose slang
the earths is not devoid of resemblance to a jail
look closely at life
it is so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment
each day has its own great gree for its little care
yesterday you were trembling for a health that is dear to you to day you fear for your own to morrowed it will be anxiety about money the day after to morrows the dia tribe of the slanderer the day after that the misfortune of some friend then the prevailing whether then something that has been broken or lost thin a pleasure with which your conscience and your verb column reproach you again the course of public affairs
this without reckoning in the pains of the heart and so to goes on
there is hardly one day out of a hundreds which is wholly joyous and sunny
and you belong to that small class who are happy
in this worlds evidently the vestibule of another there are no fortunate
the real human division as this the luminous and the shady
to diminish the member of the shady to augment the number of the luminous that is the objects
that is why we cy education science
to teach reading means to like the fire every soul silled out spirals
however he who says light does not necessarily say joy
people suffering the light excess burs
the flam the enemy of the winging
to burn without ceasing to fly therein lies the marvell of genius
you'll never dig it out of the aster library
to the young american here or elsewhere the paps to fortune are innumerable and all opened there is invitation in the air and success in all his wide horizon
he has no traditions to bind him or guide him and his impulse is to break away from the occupation his father has followed and maken me way for himself
the modest fellow would have liked thame thrust upon him for some worthy achievement it might be for a book or for the skilful management of some great newspaper or for some daring expedition like that of luted its strain or doctor can
he was unable to decide exactly what it should be
sometimes he thought he would like to stand and a conspicuous pulpit and humbly preached the gospel of repentance and it even cross his mind that it would be noble to give himself to a missionary life to some benighted region were the date palm bows and the nightin gill's voice is in tune and the bab sings on the ob nits
wall seemed to him well enough as a science but he never could discover a practical case where it appeared to him worth while to go to law and all the clients to stop with the newe clerk and the anti room of the law office where he was writing the oop invariably advised to settle no matter how but settle greatly to the disgust of his employer who knew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized processes with the attendant bees
it is such a noble ambition that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow foundation
he wanted to begin at the top of the letter
bill of therefore red diligently in the aser library plan literary works that should compel attention and nursed his genius
he had no friend wise enough to tell him to scep into the dorking convention then in session make a sketch of the men and women on the platform and take it to the editor of the daily grape vine an see what he could get a line for it
oh veryain well said grin turning away with a shad of contempt you'll find if your are going into literature and newspaper work that you can't afford a conscience like that
but still did afford it and he wrote th king his friends and declining because he said the political scheme would fail and ought the fail
and he went fact to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world
well i'm going as n inch neer you could go as one
you can begin by carrying a rodd and ping down the figures
no would s you soon
i'd been ready to go anywhere for six months
the two young men who were by this time full of the adventure went down to the wall street office of henry's uncle and had to talk with that wily operator
the night was spent in packing up and writing letters for phillip would not take such an important step without informing his friends
why it's and missouri somewhere on the frontier i think we'll get a map
i was afraid it was nearer home
he knew his uncle will would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter
he well knew the perils of the frontier the savage state of society the lurking indians of the dangers of fever
she was tired of other things
she tried this morning and ar or two upon the piano saying a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic voice and then seating herself by the open windowed red philip's letter
well mother said the young student looking up with a shade of impatience
i hope thee tolde the elders that father and irresponsible for the piano and that much as the loves musick the is never in the room when it is played
i heard father till cousin air that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now
thy ways greatly try me ruth and all thy relations
is thy father willingly should go away to a school of the world's people
i have not asked him r replied with a look that might imply that she was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own mind and then compelled others to make a theirs in accordance with hers
mother i am going to sty medicine
margaret bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity
the study medicine

and besides supposed the des lard medicine
i will practise

if i can get patience
ruth sat quite still for a time with face and tent and flushed it was out now
the sight sears returned in high spirits from the city
ruth asked the enthusiast if they would like to live in such a sounding muzzle mam with its great halls and echoing rooms and no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of any body
and then there was broad street
there certainly was no into it and even ruth was philadelphian enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end or arch dro blind upon which the weary eye could rest
but neither saint gerard nor broad street neither wonders of the meant nor the glories of the hall were the ghosts of our fathers sit always signing the declaration impressed the visitors so much as the splendours of the chestnut street windows and the bargains on a street
is thee going to the yearly meeting ruth asked one of the girls
i have nothing to wear reply that in your person
it has occupied mother a long time to find at the shops the exact shade for her new bonnet
and thee won't go why should i
if i go to meeting at all i like best to sit in the quiet old house in german town where the windows are all opened and i can see the trees and shere the sir of the leaves
if such a crush at the yearly meeting at arch street and then there's the row of sleek looking young men who ly the curbstone and sit us as we come out
he doesn't say but it's on the frontier and on the map everything beyond it is marked indians and desert and looks as desolate as a when say leading lied it was time for him to do something
is he going to started daily newspaper among the kicks
father these unjust to philip he's going into business
he doesn't say exactly what it is said ruth a little dubiously but it' something about land and railroads and the knows father that fortunes are made nobody know is exactly how in a new country
but fill of his honestest and he asked how it enough if he will stop scribbling to make his way
but a box women are put into measured for it and putt him young if we go anywhere its in a box veiled i pinioned and shut in by disabilities
why should i rest and be stupid and sit in an action because i am a girl
and if i had a fortune would do want me to lead a useless life
has de consulted thy mother about a career i suppose it is a career of the wants
but that wise and passed woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than ruth understood herself
ruth was glad to hear that philip had made a pushing to the world and she was sure that his talent and courage would make away for him
but the more forgetfulness had then prevailed the more powerful was the force of remembrance when she awoke
miss milner's health is not goods
said missus wharton a few minutes after
so there is to me at his sam ord with a sarcastic s near
and yet you must own her behaviour has warned them has it not been in this particular incoherent and unaccountable
not that i know of not one more that i know of he replied with astonishment ate what she had insulated and yet with a perfect assurance that she was in the wrong
perhaps i am mistake and answered shea
to ask any more questions of u believe would be unfair
he seemed to wait for her reply but as she made none he proceeded
oh my lord cried miss woodley when a most forcible accent you are the last person hon e she would pardon me were int trusting
but in such a case miss milner's election of a husband shall not directs mine
if she does not know how the estimate her own value i do
independent of her fortune she has beauty to captivate the heart of any man and with a follies she has a frankness in her manner an unaffected wisdom in her thoughts of av city in her conversation and with all a softness in her demeanour that might alone engage the affections of a man of the nice sentiments and the strongest understanding
my lord miss milner's taste is not a depraved one it is but too refer
what can you mean by that miss woodley you talk mysteriously
is she not afraid that i will forward her inclinations
again he searched his own thots nor ineffectually as before
miss woodley was too little verst in the subjects to know this would have been not to love at all at least not to the extent of breaking through engagements at all the various obstacles that still mitigated against their unions
to relieve her from both he laid his hand with force upon his heart and said do you believe me
i will make no unjust use of what i know he replied with firmness i believe you my lord
i have never yet however been vanquished by them and evening upon this occasion my reason shall come bat them to the last and my reason shall fail me before i do wrong
yes dead these four years and a good jo for her too
well as i say it's an awful queer world m clap all the burglars and downing the murderers in the wife peters i os thought a gentle reprove would be enough punishment for a wife beater cause he probably has a lott a provocation that nobody knows and the fire bugs can't think of the right name something li sees and the breakers of the peace and what not and yet the law has nothing to say to am like hand lord

ben z offs most ambitious desire was to induce the captain to go with him and end his days in his much loved home and so incessantly were serve ax ears besieged with descriptions of the unparalleled beauties and advantages of this eighteenth are und sim of paris that he could scarcely here the name of montmartre without a conscious thrill of aversion
when a private in the eight cavalry he had been on the point of quitting the army at twenty eight years of age but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to captain servadac
the bond of unions thus effected could never be severed and although ben's achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement he firmly declined all honours or any pension that might part him from his superior officer
unlike his master he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power but his inexhaustible memory made him a livings syclopedia and for his stock of anecdotes and trooper's tals he was matchless
fast as his legs could carry him servadac had made his way to the top of the cliff
it was quite true that a vessel was in sight hardly more than six miles from the shore but owing to the increase in the earth's convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision the rigging of the top masts alone was visible above the water
exclaimed servadac keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope
she is under sail but she is count time chefs y he was right
if the count were on board a strange fatality was bringing him to the presence of his rival
he reckoned therefore not only upon ascertaining the extent of the late catastrophe but upon learning its cause
the wind being adverse the dvina did not make very rapid progress but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained combe and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold a steady course
servadac took it for granted that the d brama was endeavouring to put in
a marrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the rushest weather would insure the calmness of its waters
slightly changing her course she first struck her main sail and in ord of facilitate the movements of her helmsman soon carried nothing but her two topsails brigantine and jib
captains servadac hastened toward him
i left you on a continent and here i have the honour of finding you on an island
never mind now interposed the captain we will talk of that by and by
nothing more than you know yourself
are you certain that this is the mediterranean
for some moments he seemed perfectly stupefied and then recovering himself he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions
to all these inquiries the count responded in the affirmative
some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements
you will take mee on board count will you not
my y is at your service sir even should you require to make it tore round the world
the counts shook his head
before starting it was indispensible that the engine of the de brama should be repaired to sail under canvas only w in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficult
it was on the last day of january that the repairs of the schooner were completed the
a slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earth's orbit was a questioned which would still require several days to decide
doubts now arose and some discussion followed whether or not it was desirable for ben zoof to accompany his master
her sea going qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe
after apprenticeship on a merchantship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private got in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cringing in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters
the late astounding events however had rendered procope mi vastly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the counts secretly partook of his own anxiety
steam up and canvas spread the schooner started eastwards
although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earth's attraction rendering the liquid particle so boy it that by the mere effective oil they were carried to a height it was quite unprecedented
for a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of algeria but no land appeared to the south
the log and the compass therefore were able to be called upon to do the work of the sextant which had become utterly useless
there's no fear of that sir

and what demonstration do you offer asked serve act eagerly that it will not happen
ocean reigned supreme
all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts sped away to his native france only to return again to wonder with of the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the algerian metropolis
is it not impossible he murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely
would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible
another circumstance was most remarkable
to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniformed depth of from fortify of fathoms and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the sight of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheatre
you muste lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria is you imagined
after pondering awhile he said if we were farther away i should expects to find a depth of two or three hundreds fathoms instead of five fathoms five fathoms
its depth remained invariable still four or at most five fathoms and although its bottom was assiduously dredged it was only to prove it baron of marine production of any type
nothing was to be done but to put about and return in disappointment toward the north

she succeeded in opening the window and the moonlight shone and so brightly that she could distinguish the color of some dams hanging in the room
she sawed that the bed was gilded and so rich that it seemed that of a prince about that that of a private gentleman
among anther things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window
this person was red though y had gone to look for his friends had changed his minded in that respects not thinking it advisable to acquaint them with what had passed between him in the girl
on the contrary he resolved to tell them that repenting of his violence and moved by a tears had only carried her halfway towards his house and then let her go

and the boy walked tor the streets blessings were showered up him by all who saw him blessing upon his beauty upon the mother that bore him up the father that they got him upon those who brought him up so well
one day when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsemen

you know captain lake
said lord chelford addressing me
he had his hand upon lake shoulder
they cousins you know we are all cousins
whatever lord chelford said miss brandon received it very graciously and evening with a momentary smile
but her greeting to captain leak was more than usually haughty and frozen and her features i fancied particularly proud and pale
at dinner lake was easy of amusing
i'm glad you like it says wilder chuckling benignantly on it over his shoulder
i believe i have a little taste that way those are all real you know those jewels
and he placed it in that gentleman's fingers who now took his turned at the lamp and contemplated the little parallelogram with a gleam of sly amusement
i was thinking it's veryain like the ae of hearts answered the captain softly smiling on
whereupon lake laughed quietly still looking on the east of hearts with his sly eyes
and wilder left tow more suddenly and noisily than the humour of the joke seemed quite to call for and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes un lake but the gallant captain and did not seem to perceive it and after a few seconds more he handed it veryain innocently back to missus darky only remarking
do you know lake oh i've really can't tell but he'll soon tire of country life
he's not a man for country quarters
i h a horrid dream about him last night that
oh i know that's lorn brandon
all the time he was talking to me his angry little eyes were following lake
miss lake declined the carriage to night
and he added something still less complimentary
but dont these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly
in the meantime i had formed a ne idea of her
by this time lord chelford and wilder returned and disgusted rather with myself i ruminated on th want of generalship
and he made a little dip of his can towards brandon hall over his shoulder
yes so they said but that would i thinkin worse
if a fellows been a little bit wild he is be ells above at once
bracton's a veryain good fellow i can assure you
i don't know im can't say how you finde gentleman to fined wickedness only as an obscure female i speak according to my lights and he is generally thought the wickedest man in this county

there walk continued silent for the greater part neither was quite satisfied with the other but rachel at last dead
now that's impossible ready for i really don't think i once thought of him all this evening except just roll we were talking
there was a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging bows and withered leaves and the model lights and shadows glided oddly across pale features
don't insult me stanley by talking again if you did this morning
when i say is altogether on your own accounts
mark my words you'll find him too strong for you i am too deep
i am very uneasy about it whatever it is i can't help it
to my mind there h always been something inexpressibly awful in family fields
the mystery of their origin their capacity for evolving lading faculties of crime and the study vitality with which they survived the hers and speak their deep mouth malignities in everye newborn generation have ass sei did them somehow in my mind with a spell of life exceeding and distinct for human and the special satanic action
the floor more than anything else showed the great age of the room
my bed was unexceptional ble comfortable but in my that moode i could have wished it the great deal more modern
its curtains were of thick and faded tapestry
all the furniture belonged other times
i shan't trouble you about my train of thoughts or fancies but i began to feel veryain like a gentleman in the go story watching experimentally in a haunted chambre
i did not even take the precaution of smoking of the chimney
i boldly lighted my chute
a cold bright moon was shining with clear sharp lights and shadows
the somber old trees m gigantic hurst plumes black and awful
somehow i had grown nervous
a little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly
it was not very much pasted ale in that morning when the pony carriage from brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of reading's farm
well she was better though she had had a bout night
so there came a step and a little rustling of feminine dree breeze the small door opened and rachel entered with her hand extended and a pale smile of balcom
women can hide their pain better than we men and bear it better too except when shame drops fire into the dreadful calle
but poor rachel leak had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile
this transit springing and lighting up o beautiful a glamour beguiling our senses
there was something of sweetness and foughten in her tones and manner which was new rachel and comforting and she returned the grating as kindly and felt more like her form herself
rachel's pale and sharpen features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise
you have been so ill my poor rachel
ill and trouble dear troubled in mind and miserably nervous
poor rachel her nature recoiled from deceit and she told at all events as much of the truth as she dared
she spoke with a sudden energy which partook a fear and passion and flushed her thing cheek and made her languid eyes flash
think you rachel my cousin rachel my only friend
tilford had ae from mister wilder this morning another note his cunning delay and something of his having to see some person who was broad continued dorcas
yes something everything said rachel hurriedly looking frowningly at a flower which she was tarling in her fingers
yes said rachel
and the wan oracle having spoken she sat down in the same sort of obstruction again beside dorcas and she looked fool in her cousin's eyes
of mark wilder i say this his name has been for years hateful to me and recently it has become frightful and you will promise me simply this that you will never ask me to speak again about him
it is an antipathy and in tibet the i cannot get over dear dorcas you may think it a madness but don't blame me
i have very revery few to love me now and i thought you might love me as i have begun to love you
and she threw her arms round her cousin's neck and grave rachel at last burst into tears
dorcas in her strange way was moved
i like you still rachel i'm sure i'll always like you
you resemble ne rachel you are fearless and inflexible and generous
yes rachel i do love you

noting young castle was reachd and a mittens was demanded
master mons the sheriff nottingham was mightily put about when told of the riding
and henry might return to england at any moment
have your will childe if the boy also will sitten mony sh answered feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then
he made an effort to hide his conditioned from them all and robin felt his fingers tighten upon his arm
begged the a room of the sheriff child quickly
but h is his fellow plucking her re steve
he is my esquire excellency returned robin with dignity
mistress fitzooth had been carried off by the sheriff daughter in her maids as soon as they had entered the house so that robin alone had the care of mony shay
robin was glad when at lang they were left to their own devices
the win d had certainly bringing back the colour to the squire's cheeks
these escapades are not for old game well led his day has come to twilight
will you forgive me now
it' will be no disappointment to me
no thanks i am glad to give you such easy happiness
you are worthy lech will presently whispered robin the wine has worked a marvell
i and show you some pretty tricks
young fitzooth had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his converse with the squire
there be fell an anxious interview mistress fitzooth arguing four against the squires projecting breath
most of all robin thought of his father what would he council
if for when you beggar yourself i cannot stay you
but take it whilst i live and where mont vy shies shielded in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so brave sight for you will never disgrace oars dutch and i warrant me
the lad eject him then
never that sir he had said
he was in deep converse with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arm
now to bed boy
tis late and i go myself within a short space
dismiss squire robin and bid me good eaten
as any in england i would say said came well proudly that is in his day
yet he will te you a few tricks when morning is come
there was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to gain wells chamber
presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step
will cried he softly and studley who had chosen his couch across the door of his young master's chamber sprang up at once and answer
we will go out together to the bower there is away down to the court from my window
rest and be still until i warn you
the hours passed wearily by and movement could yet be heard about the hall
at last all was quiet and blacken the courtyard of gamewell
will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready
they then renewed their journey and under the better light made a save crossing of the stable roofs
robin entered the hut dragging the unwilling quire after him
be not so foolish friend said f tooth crossly
they moved thereafter cautiously about the hut groping before an about them to find something to show that the warrant and had fulfilled his mission
they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and studley had tripped over the edge of the revers flap mouth of this pit
fitzooth's hand rested at last upon the top run of a later and slowly the truth came to him
robin carefully descended the latter and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground
studley was by his side in the flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and characters of his vault
from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice warrenton's
save the masters but you startled me rarely
cried he waving the lantern before him to make sure that these were no ghost and front of him
inquired robin with his suspicions still upon him
truely such a horse would be worth much a noding him fair
day lording answered warrenton with a half laugh
warrant and spoke thus with significance to show robin that he was not to think jeffreys claims to the estate would be passed by
robin fitzooth saw that his doubts of warrant toon had been unfair and he became ashamed himself for her bring them
his tones rang pleasantly on wantons ears and forth with the good fellowship was heralded between them
the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gain well that this passage way led from the hutton a pleasance to sherwood and that jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
he implores us to be discreet as the grave and this matter for sooth his life is in the hollow of our hands
they regained their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gain well
out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree
the place he had was a veryain good one the sun shone on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as furs
he did not think of the warms son and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
but this was what the tree could not bear to hear
in winter when the snow lag glittering on the ground a hair would often come leaping along and jumped right over the little tree
oh that made him so angry
to grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most delightful thing in the worlds
in autumn the woodcutters always came and fell some of the largest trees
this happened everye year and the young fur trey that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earths with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked longing and beare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were lading cars and the horses dragged of them out of the wood
have you not met them anywhere
rejoice and thy growth said the sunbeams
and then what happens then
i would feint know if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh
where i but already on the cart
where i in the warn room with all the splendor and magnificence
yes and something better something still grander will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ornament me
something better som things still grander must follow but what
with choice in our presence said the air and the sunlight
rejoice in my own fresh youth
but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter in summer
and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
the ax struck deep into the veryain pith the tree fell to the earths with a sigh he felt a pangs like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
the departure was not at all agreeable
the tre only came to himselfe when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and he a man say that one is splendid we don't want the others
there too were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture books and full of toys were hundreds in the hundreds of crowns at least the childrens so
the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
this evening they all said
how it will shine this evening
perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me
it blazed up famously help help
cried the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire
a story
a story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree
but i shall tell only one story
humpy don't be fell downstairs an ya he married the princess
that's the way of the worlds
thought the fir tree and believed at all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
i won't tremble to morrow thought the fir tree
and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought
in the morning the servants and the housemaid came in
but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here it a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
what's the meaning of this thought the tree
and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie
time enough had he too for his reflections for days and knights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in the corner out of the way
tis now winter out of doors thought the tree
how kind man is after all
if only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely
squeak squeak
they snuffed about the fir tree and rustled among the branches
i am by no means old said the fir tree
there's mi a one considerably older than i am
they were so extremely curious
i know no such place said the tree
and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the light before and they listened and said
said the fur tree thinking over what he had himself related
yes in reality those more happy times
oo is humpy dump asked the mice
only that one answered the tree
it is a veryain stupids story
don't you know one about bacon and tale candles can'st you tell any lat stories
no said the tree
then good by said the rats and they went h
at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree side after all it was veryain pleasant when the sleek little m sat round me and listened to what i told them
now that too is over
why one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft
the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
but it was not the thir tree that they mends
it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
in the courtyards some of the marian children were playing who had danced at christmas round the thur tree and were so glad at the sight of him
and the gardener's boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and its sighed so deeply
however that was over now the tree gone the story at an ended
genet and beth refrained from dollington girls or uncle john of old will rogers visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned who closely about the penalty for fortune a check
it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and to gates bade fair to serve a length the term in the states prison as a consequence of his rash act
i can't see it in that light said the old lawyer
it was a deliberate left from his employers to protected girl he loved
but they could not have prove in a gas against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were properly a mere bluff
he was soft hearted an impetuous said beth and being in love heed didn't stop to count the cost
if the prosecution word withdrawn and the gas settled with the victim of the forge check then the young man would be allowed freedom
but under the circumstances i doub a such an age it could be made
fair views twelve miles away but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county trail
they were received in the little office by and the markham who was the jailer
we wished to talk with him answered kenneth talk
i'm running for representative on the republican ticket said kenneth quietly
oh say that's different observed marken altering is demeter
maybe see gates at once asked kenneth
they followed the jailer along the succession of passages
sometimes on that year in for a smoke em nearly crazy and ion know which his worse died one way other
he am not the storing called here's visitors tom
worse tomb harse and error replied the jailer cloy
mister graf said kenneth noticing the boys face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it
sorrow we have an any reception room in the jail
samples said gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice there's a pent
a fresh wholesome looking boy was tom gates was steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth
we have heard something of your story said kenneth and are interested in it
i didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and i'm glad i did it
old will as a fine fellow but poor and helpless since missus rogers had her accident
then rudders wouldn't do anything but leader around and wait upon her and the place went to rack ruin
he spoke simply but paste up and down the now cell in friend of them
whose named yet you signed to the check asked kenneth
he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concert
it's a stop company in rich
i was bit keeper so it was easy to get a lin check and fort the signature
as regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved him a heavy lost one day
i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant but marten even think me
it was better for him to think that girl un feeling th to know the truth
i'm going to see mister marshal said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thank you sir
it won't be much but im grateful to find a friend
they left him then for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office
i'll see what's that kind in my day
and it ruins a man's dispositions
he looked up rather ungracious wee but motioned them to be seated
some girls been in here twice interview my men and i have refused to admit her
i'm not electioneering just now
oh well sir what about him
and he deserves the term in states prison
it is cost me twice sixty dollars and annoyance
i'll pay all the caus besides
you're foolish why should do do all this
i have my own reasons mister merci
give me a check for hundred and fifty and altered over to you the forge check and cash further proceedings
he detested the grasping dispiteous that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gates
f uneasy his silence mug him
there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face
he might have had that for check for the face of it if he'd been sharped
and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars
so to the surprise at the democratic committee and all his friends mister hopkins announced that he would oppose forts a dress of campaign with an equals ness and spend as many dollars and doing so as might be necessary
one of mister hopped in's first tasks after calling his faithful henchmen around him was to make a careful cas of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
the weak need contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the others secured from opposition
the democratic committee figured out away to do this
under ordinary conditions reels was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to cogs
the only thing necessary was to fix set renal and this hopkins arranged personally
and this was why kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy
the descriptions she gave of the coming reception to the women's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the occupant of the other vehicle were
these women were flattered by the attentions of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing mister forbes
louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted
the fair view band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house or tax to entertain the guests
tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served
this was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given an elmhurst and the only when within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been the invited guests
the attendants was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted f seeing great success for their fight
we ought to have more attendants beth said louise approaching her cousin
won't you run into the house and see if martha can spare one or two more maids
she was veryain fond of the young ladies whom she had known when aunt jane was their mistress here and beth was her special favorite
the housekeeper let the way in bath followed
for a moment beth stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and old slight smile upon her beautiful face
she was dressed in the regulation cost him of the maids at elmhurst a plaining black gown with a white apron and cap
that she gave a little l and replied no miss beth i'm elizabeth parsons
but it can't be protested the girl
i attend to the household bending you know and care for the linen
you speak like an educated person said beth wonderingly where iss your home
for the first time the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor
she sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rock slowly backing forth i'm sorry said beth
eliza parsons shook her head
they they excite me in some way and i i can't bear them you must excuse me
she even seem mildly amused at the attentions she attracted
math was a beautiful girl the handsomest of the three cousins by far yet eliza sur passed herr in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact
her matter was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well bread composure and calm relies
her eyes wonder to the ma's hand
however her features and f might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story
she rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath
i wish i knew myself she cried fiercely
will you leave be alone in my own room or must i go away to escape you
eliza close the door behind her with a decided slam and a ke clicked in the lock
conon cord returned its place amidst the tents
the english footed to the french baskets of flowers of which they had made a pip for vision to gree be arrival of the young princess the french in returned invited the english to a supper which was to be given the next day
congratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey
from the respected paine her on all signs she seemed like a queen and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three she appeared an object of worship the queen mother gave the french the most affectionate reception france was her native country and she had suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget friends
she ton her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had both been hospitably received and where a brilliant future opened for them
the count had thrown himselfe back on his seat leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus his face buried in his hands with heaving chest and restless limbs
this has indeed been a harassing day continued the young man his eyes fixed upon his friend
you will be frank with me i always am
can your imagine my buckingham has been so fallen i suspected
it is you more mistaken row i have read his distress in his eyes in his every gesture and action the whole day
i can perceive love clearly enough
i am convinced of what i say said the count
it is annoyance then
in those very revery terms i even added more
but continued rowl not interrupted by this moment of his friend heavenly praised the french who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet reckless evenin are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to barn matters of such high importance
bus it is that the honor of thresh is sin are country are masters and our own
yes i knee repose many things have agitated me to day both in mind and body when you returned tomorrow i shall no longer be the same man
but in this friendly pressure riou could detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict
the night was clear starlit and splendid the tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life peace and security everywhere
upon the large square in front of the hotel the shadows of the tents insect by the golden moon deems formed as it were a huge moa of jet and yellow flagstones
br on watched for some time the conduct of the two lovers listened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of man a camp whose snored as impiously as though he was winging his bluing gold instead of his vied suit
go liath makes another discovery
they were slyly no near the solution of their problem
the poor little things cried sin thea think of them having been turned to the wall all these years
now what is the sents of it tus bani like that
but joys had not been listening all at once she put down her candle on the tablet and faced her companions
the twin brother did something she dent like and she turned his picture to the wall
hers happened to be on the same frame too but she evidently dint care about it
now what have you to say sin this bragg
i thought we were stumped again when i first saw that picture but it spent of some yous after all
do you suppose the mature was a copy of the same thing
what of the world is it cleary choice
they were a me terribly am besides u like to see what this lovely furniture looks without such quantities of dust all over it d it schemes
will come and this afternoon with old clots on an habit ruler house cleaning
it can't heard anything i'm sure for we won't disturb things at all
this thought however did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair
smuggling the house cleaning paria into the cellar window un observed that afternoon proved no easy task for cynthia had added a wis broom and dust pan to the outfit
bulwer proved too much form and he came sporting after it as fickly as a young kitten much to sim delight when she caught sight of him
oh let him come along she urged i do loved to seek him about bed old hows
he makes it sort of cos yer
mow it's des the furniture and pictures
yet little as it was it had already made a fast difference in the aspects of the room
surface us at least had been removed and the fine olde further chu gave the hint of its real elegance and polish
then and she suddenly remarked
and my pocket money his getting low again and you have it any left as usual
they say illumination by candlelight is the prettiest in the world
why it's com mat th usual the both cried peering in
isn't he the greatest for begin to odd corners
forgetting all their weariness they seize the candles in sty through the house finding on occasional paper tucked away in some odd corner
well and confessed that the boarded up house mystery happened not earlier than april sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probably not much later
no words were spoken no language was uttered saved of wailing in hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and naw reality
i heard a noise behind i turned and saw kaffer his black eyes shining wall in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted above his head as if to strike but a had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me
on were said a distant voice
no sound broke the stillness of the night
the story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered conditions i wondered whether there was not some truth and what had been said
what was that
what then a human hand large and shaly appear distinctly on the surface of the pond
nothing more not even the wrist to which it m be attached
it did not beckon or indeed move at all it was as still as the hand of death
i wo to consciousness fighting at first h seemed as if i was fighting with the phantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was caff
a sound of voices a flash of light
a feeling a freedom and i was awake where
said another voice which i recognize ful tiers caff
i had scarcely known when i had been saying or dinging up to this time by as he spoke i looked at my hand
in the light of the moon i saw on knife read with blooded and my hand to was also discolored
i do not know i am dazed bewildered
but that is caffs knife
i know he had it this very evening
i robe saying how we've been together
mile chair picked up something from the ground and looked att it
i say you do know what this means and you must tell us
a terrible thought flashed into my mind
i had again but acting under the influence of this man's power
perchance too caffs death might serve him in good stead
by tone refused to articulate my power of speech left me
my position was too terrible
my overwrought nerves shielded at last
for some time after that i remembered nothing distinctly
the three modes of management
to suppose that the objects of this work is to aid in affecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
by reason an affection
as the chase drives away marry stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexation and ill humor serge and swell among those delegate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps and irreparable injury
the mothers as soon as the chase is so far turned that mary can no longer watch the expression of her confidence goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satis faction on her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice
so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't you
the mother in managing the case in this way ried partly on convincing their reason of the child and partly on an appealed to her affection
if you should not be a good gurl but should show signs of makings any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone
but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble
it is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection cannot be overrated
to such persons these indirect modes of training children inhabits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
della had a young sister name mia and a cousin whose name was jane
now gila contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls
to give an idea of these conversations i will report one of them in full
you have come and della and della was the name of janes doll to make rosalie a visit
i am very glad
i expected you have been a very revery good gurl and della since you were here last
then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has she been a good girl jane
for instance one day the children had been plain upon the pips with blocks and other playthings and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the pianosa instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
they were now playing with their dolls in the parlor
delia came to the parlor and with an air of great mystery beckon the children aside and set to them in a whisper leave and della and rosalie hare and don't say awd them
so saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the room and round by a sir cus root to the piazza there
said she pointing to the play things see
put these ply things all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know anything of about youre leaving them out
and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any directs rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been
nature of the effects produced by early impressions
that is comparatively nothing
they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
we have going to any such extreme is this we can easily see on reflection how vast in influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action i theatre years must be exerted by the nature and characters of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impress upon the mind
the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a fathers subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
but ands cared nothing about that
he made a abou so deep that his back came near breaking and he was done founded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but ands
he was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife
now this knife was a splendid one though half the blab was gone and handle was a little cracked and ands knew that one is al most a man as soon as one has a jack knife
yes why not thought ands
seem that i am so fine i may as well go and does it the king
i am going to the court ball answered ands
and she took ands hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at everye third step and through the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing wherever he went
for like as not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap
at the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in longing rose
on huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters
the princess set down under a blue canopy with bokes a roses and she let and her sit in a golden chair by her side
but you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to day g it off
the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition
he only shook his head
well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him
that is a veryain fine cap you have he said
so it is said ands
and it is made of mother's best yawn and she knitted it herself and everybody once to get it away for me
with one jump ands got out of his chair
he darted lien arrow through all the halls down all the stairs and across the yards
he still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouth's open
but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a king's golden crowned he said that ands was a stupid
ands face grew red
but his mother hub close
no my little son she said
if you dressed in sill and gold from top to toe you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap
at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five o'clock the king entered his cabinet were his tailors or awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cus so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court
ah veryain well
let him come in then said the king and as if colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself ach with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two courtiers
gentleman to you posts whereupon saint any in vil took their leave
certainly sire but i must have money to do that what
what you meane inquired louise
he has given them with too much grace not to have other still to give if they are required which h the case at the present moment
it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned
does your majesty then no longer believe the disloyal attent
not at all you are on the contrary most agreeable to me
your majesty's planed then in this affair is
you will take them from my private treasure
the news circulated with the rapidity of lightning during its progress it kindled everye vari of coquetry desire and wild ambition
the kan had completed his toilet by nine o'clock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers
the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent days or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theatre of wonderful elegance of constructions
suddenly for the purpose of resting piece in order springing accompanied by his whole court made his appearance
the seasons allies of springing followed him closely to form quadra which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the ance
his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage and flesh colored silken hose a silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
there was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seemed to sore along
yes it is suppressed
far from its sire your majesty having given no directions about it the musicians retained
yes sire and ready dressed for the ballet
sire he said your majesty's most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasioned with similar zeal that he is already shown on the field of battle
the king seemed only pleased with everyone present
monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter
the bally began the effected was more than beautiful
when the musick by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutored pantin of that period only the more natural on account of the vari in different acting of the august actors had reached its culminating point of triumph the theatre shook with tumultuous applause
disdain full of a successive which madame showed no acknowledgment he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the market preference of the princess
by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupified
the king who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quad real cast look upon his vanquish d rival
everyone could observe his agitation and prostration a prostration which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and his eyes with their bright intelligence be dimmed
upon this madame dean to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte observing
do you thinks so she replied with indifference
yes the characters which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own
explain yourself
i allude to the goddess
the princess inquired no
she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance
the arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally
a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theatre but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love is thus strangely constituted he founded impossible even to remain much longer separated from their presence of one who had broken his heart
when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in amidst of idee she was desirous of concealing from herself
remain i implore you the evening is most lovely
indeed a
i remember now and ian congratulate myself do you love anyone
forgive me i hardly know what i am saying a thousand times forgive me madame was right quite right this brutal exile has completely turned to my brain
there cannot be a doubt he received you kindly for in fact you returned without his permission
oh mademoiselle why have i not a devoted sister or a true friend such as yourself
what already here they said to her
i have been here this quarter of an hour replied l levi
did not the dancing amuse you no

in fact the sound of madam's and a queen's carriages could be heard in the distance upon the hard dry ground of the roads followed by the mountain cavaliers
in this way the fed of the whole court was a fet also for the mysterious inhabitants of the forest for certainly the dear in the break the pheasant on the branch the fox in its hole were all listening
all about him was a tumult of bright and broken color scattered e broad splashes
the regan ser had a crested head of ear descent green black a broad collar of lustrous white black back black and white wings white belly sides finally penciled and blacken light and a brest of rich chestnut red streaked with black
his feet were read his long narrow beak with its saw tooth edges and sharp hooked tip was bright red
but here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls hawks and eagles he had no rending calls
but suddenly street and swift as a di in cormorant he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface
once fairly a winging however he wheeled made back hurriedly for his perch
and wind have seemed that a trout of this size was a fairly substantial meal
but such was his keenness that evening while the wide flukes of his engorge victim were still sticking out of the cars of his beak his fierce red eyes once more appearing downward into the torrent and search a fresh prey
in despair he hurled himself downward too soon
the great hawk followed hardly to retrieve his prey from the ground
the cat growled softly thicked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it
in fact he had just finish it the last of the trout's tail had just vanish with a spasm down his strained get when the baffled haw caught sight of him and swooped
the hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if surprised
like his unfortunate little cousin the teal he too had felt the fear of deaths smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge some dark over hanging bank deep fringed with weeds where the dreadful e of the hawk should not discern him
the hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface
almost instantly as force to the top
straightway the hoo glided from his perch and darted after him
but at this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down
but this frequenter of the heights of air for all his savage valor was troubled at the leaping waves and the tossing fol of these mad rapids he did not understand them
as he flew his down reaching clutching talents were not half a yard ab the fugues head
were the ways for an instant sank they came closer but not quite within grasping reach
but as before the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer and he was able to flap his wayward and the cloud a fume old doom hung lob of his head yet hesitated to strike
the hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged in pursuit as a weasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived
he had a lot of line out and the place was none too free for a long cast but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was speeding
the last drop fly as luck would have it caught just in the corner of the hawks angrily opened beak hooking itself firmly
at the sudden sharp stinging of it the great bird turned his head and noticed for the first time the fisherman standing on the bank
the drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to and appalling

this would being easy way of dinging it but it would not be the best way for the re that it is too easy to call attention to itself
in the old badly made play it was frequently necessary it for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence
in the modern well constructed play he simply rings up an imaginary confederate and tells in what he is going to do could anything be more natural

several hundred free state man promptly responded to the summons
it was in fact the best weet of its day
the leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town
one at his mica generals suggested that the governor should require the outlaws at lawrence and elsewhere too surrender the sharps rifles another wrote asking him to call out to government troops at fort levin worth
the governor on his part becoming doubtful of the validity of employing missing militia to enforce cans laws was also eager to secure the help of federal troops
caher joneses had his pockets always full of writs issued in the spirit of persecution that was often baffled by the sharp wits and ready resources of the free state people and sometimes deified outright

though throwing to prison for this enterprise and detained some time he was not discouraged but still continued by his countenance and protection to infuse spirit into the distressed royalists
among other persons of distinction who united themselves to him was lord napier of murchison son of the famous inventor of the logs the person to whom the title of a great man is more justly du th to any others whom his country ever produced
while the former foretold that the scottish covers were secretly forming a unions with the english parliament and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking the latter still insisted that every such attempt would precipitate them into measures to which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined
the king's ears were now opened to mont roses counsels who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cause in scotland
five hundreds men more who had been levied by the covenants were persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combined force he hastened to attack lord echo who lay at par with an army of six thousand men assembled upon the first news of the irish invasion
dreading the superior power of our guile who having joined his vassals to a force levi by the publick was approaching with a considerable army montrose hastened northward in order to rouse again the marquis of huntley and the gordons who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the covenants
this nobleman's character though celebrated for political courage and conducted was veryain low for military prowess and after of some skirmishes in which he was worsted he here a lowed montrose to escape him
by quick marches through these inaccessible mountains that general freed himself from the superior forces of the coiners
with these and some reinforcements of the ath men and molds whom he had recalled montrose fou suddenly upon our gil's country and let loose upon it all the rage of war carrying off the cattle burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword
this severity by which montrose slided his victories was the results of private animosity against the chieftain as much as of zeal for the publick cause our guile collecting three thousands men marched in questioned the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at inner locking supposing himself still at a considerable distance from them
by a quick and unexpected march montrose hastened to interlock and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised but not the frightened covenant
his conduct and presence of mind in this emergence appeared conspicuous
montrose weak in cavalry here lined his troops of horse with infantry and after putting the enemies horse to rout fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cut in pieces though with the loss of th gallant lord gordon on the part of the royalists
from the same men new regiments and new companies were formed different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands as the independence could real
besides members of parliament who were excluded many officers unwilling to serve under the new generals threw up their commissions and and warily facilitated the projects of putting the army and turley into the hands of that faction
though the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible a more exact plan was introduced and rigorously executed by these new commanders
valor indeed was very revery generally diffused over the one party as well as the others during this period discipline also was attained by the forces of the parliament but the perfection of the military art in concerting the general plans of action and the operations of the field scenes still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting
historians at least perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience have not remarked anything but a headlong impetuous conducted each party hurrying to a battle were valor and fortune chiefly determined the success
he passed through henley sin albans and came so near to london as harrow on the hill
the scottish generals and commissioners affected great surprise on the appearance of the king and though they paid him all the exterior respected due to his dignity they instantly set a guard upon him under color of protection and made him in reality a prisoner
they informed the english parliament of this unexpected incident and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king

the parliament than the scots laid their proposals before the king
before the settlement of terms the administration must be possessed entirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms and how incompatible that scheme with the liberty of the king is easily imagined
the english it is evident had they not being previously assured of receiving the king would never have parted with so considerable as sum and while they weakened themselves by the same measure have strength and a people with whom they must afterwards have so material and interest to discuss
if any still retained rank against him in his present conditions they passed in silence while his well wishers more generous than prudent accompanied his march with tears with acclamations and with prayers for his safety
his death in this conjuncture was a publick misfortune
the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bringing up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual cortes all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
whether are not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might se an overstatement and it might seem more corrected to say that id approximately represent impressions
and what sort of evidence is logically possible
there is no logical impossibility and the hypothesis that the worlds sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with the population that remembered a wholly unreal past
all that i'm doing is to use its logical tina ability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
the behaviourist to attempts to make psychology a record of behavior has to trust his memory in making the record
habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist fills confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
but i do not thinks such an inference is warned
our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a france face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
some images like some sensations pill very familiar while others fill strange
familiarity is a filling capable of degrees
in an image of a well known face for example some parts may fl more familiar at th others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as preferring to more less remote portions of the past
in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the flinging of greater or less remoteness and some remembered event
there may be a specific flinging which could be called the filling of pastes especially where immediate memory is concerned
there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such fillings must play an essential part and the process of dating remembered events
if we had retained the subjects or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
remembering has to be a present occurrence and some way resembling or related to what is remembered
some points may betaken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arriv
in this case as in most others what may be taken a certain in advance is rather v
the first of our vague but indubitable data is there is knowledge of the past
we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards im media sey
this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gram fons as they like to believe
i can set to wort now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasions on which he has recited or read it
symons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief at these images referred to pass occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
it is this that is a interest to theory of knowledge
it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at sometime experienced the well known illusion that all that has happening now happened before at some time
whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leases to search the environment until we are satisfy that we have found the appropriate objects which leads us to the judgement this is familiar
thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the flinging of familiarity alone
a further stage is recognition
recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more that a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of paring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an objects that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sinse and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sence of the word
this knowledge is memory and one sense though in another it is not
there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more corrects to define recognition as i have seen this before th as this has existed before
the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory a among the most important
thus if i recognize the thing the occasions of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognise it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled d from the rest of the world
of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
i remain there alone for many hours but i mus ignited that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light
had ev crasweller not been good looking had jack been still at college had sir kennington ovver remained in england had mister bunnit and the barkeeper not succeeded and stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in a rating for the final departure of my old friend
on arriving at home at my own residence i found that our salon was filled with a brilliant company
as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mode of a dress that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self
i have come to your shores mister president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world
we have our little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rosewater
we are quite satisfied now captain battle axe said my wife
quite satisfied said eva
the ladies and compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic are on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed or on the other
no doubt in process of time the ladies will follow
their masters said missus never bend
i did not mean said capta battles the touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this
missus never been you must indeed be proud of your son
jack have had been standing in the four corner of the room talking to eva and was now reduced to silence by his praises
sir kennington oval is veryain fine player said my wife
i and my wife and son and the two crest wells and three or four others agreed to din on bo the ship on the next
this i felt was paid to me h being president other republick and i endeavoured to be hy myself the such mingled humility and dignity as might be fit the occasions but i could not but feel as something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life
my wife on the spur the moment managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner
this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with there
then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
oh yes said jack and i'm nowhere
but i mean to have my endings before long
of what missus never b had gone through providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success
we sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then went ashore
how much of evil of real accomplished evil had there not occur toy during the last few days
what could i do now but just lay myself down and die
and the death of which i dru could not alas
when this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the furthers side of the island and there in seclusion what i e my days
jack would become ev's happy husband and would remain a midst the hurried duties of the eager world
thinking of all this i went sleep
mister never bend began the captain and i observe that up to that moment he had generally address me president they cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
you have received us with all that curtesy in hospitality for which your characters in england stand so high
it is a duty said i
but your power is so superi to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace and yielding to it
not a dal but had your force been only double or trouble our own i should have found it my duty to struggle with you
that is all quite true mister never been said sir ferdinand th brown
i can afford to smile because i am absolutely parlous before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the worlds concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force
you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republick to receiveth you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
i can assure you he has not evening allowed me to see the trigger since i have had been on board
then said sir ferdinand there is nothing for it but that we must take you with him
there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
you hear what sir ferdinand brown h said replied captain battle ax
but one is to delicate mission i asked
i was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage and matter not which
then the republick of britain ella was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be g exulted and a british governor and stalled in the executive chambers
you may be quite shorts there said captain battle ax and that i can so use it asked to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board
you propose to kid not me i said
well will become with your gun where i to ken you
lieutenant crosstrees is a veryain gallant officer
one of us always remains on board while the others on shore
what world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both on my words had up been possible my just like centered itself on ser ferdinand
youll allow me to suggest he but that is a matter of opinion
were id to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seemed to have done so willingly hereafter
the letter ran as follows
sir i have in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which is called britain ne la
the peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your excellences knowledge
but in their selection of a constitution the britain u lists have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprung their present difficulties
it is founded on the acknowledge weakness of those who sur vi that period of life at which men ceased to work
but it is surmise that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your governor

when you intend that the john bright shall start

and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the arch of the government
i shall be happy to take charge of them said sir fernando
they have course must all the author
or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible
your power is sufficient i said
if you will give us your promise to meet kat them alex here at this time to morrow we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the john bright for twenty four hours
and this plan was adopted too in order to extract from me a promise that i would depart in peace

three seconds before the arrival of jab hobson's letter i know more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the northwest passage
even so i had just returned from an arguments journey exhausted and badly needing a rest
i wanted nothing more than to see my country again my friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved collections
but now nothing could hold me back
ca s was my man servant
from rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the botanical gardens the boy had come to now a thing or two
classifying was everything to him so he do nothing else well versed in a theory of classification he was poorly first in its practical application and doubt that he could tell sperm well from a blin whale
and yet what a fine gallant lad
not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of the journey
never did he objected to buckling up his suitcase for any country whatever china or the congo no matter how far of it was
he went here there and everywhere in perfect contentment
pleace forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting that i had turned forty
he was a fanatic on formality and he only ad dressed me in the third person to the point were it got hys
there was good reason to stop and think evening for the world's most emotionless man
conseil i called a third time conseil appeared
dead masters summon me he said entering
back as much into my trunk as you can my travelling kit my suits shirts and socks don't bother counting just squeeze it all in and hurry for
we'll do with them lighter what
anyhow will leave instructions to ship the whole maury to france
yes we are certainly i replied evasively but after we make a detour
a rout slightly less direct that's all
were leaving on the abraham lincoln
you seene my friend it's an issue of the monster but notorious nor wall
we don't know where will take us
but were going just the same
we have a commander whose game for anything for
i left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to paris france
i opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the babisa and conseil at my heels i jumped into a carriage
our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate i rushed aboard
i asked for commander fair that
one of the sailors led me to the after deck where i stood in the presence of a smart looking officer who extended his hand to me
in in person welcome avid professor your cabin is waiting for you
i was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officer's ms
will be quite comfortable here i told conseil
and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or evenin less the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this on earthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some skepticism
the wars of brookland and every part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers for
departing from five hundred thousand throats three cheers burst forth in succession
thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses haling the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river at the tip of the long pent that forms new york city
then he rushed downstairs into the courtyard shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to patch every boney is dominions that the sailor man was not recaptured
hold him fast m inne and as soon as ive had my coffee in oo's take him to the room of the great knife and pat him
i wouldn't mind loo co gavin myself said came ble i have had considable exeter eyes this morning and im already for breakfast
but captain build made no such attempt knowing it would be useless
as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boolooroo gave a yellow disappointment
the room of the great knife was high and bigg and a rounded ran rose of benches for the spectators the sit upon
in one blace at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant thrown chairs for the king and queen and six smaller but richly a poster chairs for the snub nos princesses
therefore her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her
rich jewels of blue ses glittered upon no persons and the royal ladies were fully gorgias as the wor haughty and overbearing
morning girls peep as we as you look
control yourselves in my dears replied the bloo the worse punishment i knew how do inflict on on any one this prisoners of b to suffer you will see a veryain pretty patching my royal daughters
suppose its of band
the captain shook his head
why you sic of thatch the thirst living cure re met and that was the spit note replied the captain panting harde as he held ass to one of the goats horns
the idea a patching captain bill to a goat was a vastly amusing to him and more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter
they look something alike you suggested the captain of the guards looking from one to the other doubtfully and they nearly the same size that you stand boon as hargrave both got the same style of whiskers and their both of them obstinate in dangerous so they ought to make a good patch splendid
fine hors
when this had been accomplished the boolooroo leaned overt to tri to you discover why the frame rolled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzle because it had never done such thing before
at once the goat gave a leap escape from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the boolooroo
before any could stop him he bed his majesty so furiously that the king sword spar into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay moning and groaning
the goats warlike spirit was roused by their successful a tap
then they sped in great haste for the door and the go gave a final but this in the row of royal ladies all dieting into the corridor in another tangle whereupon they shrieked in a matter that terrified everyone of in sound of their voices
i a notion it was you mad d sate me from the knife
i couldn't sugar much being bounds tight but when i loves a mean to have just one good shiver to relieve my feelings
coming get the ble rule she said throwing towards the benches
so they were quite willing to oby the orders of their girl queen and in a short time the blast of trumpets and roll of drums and clashing of symbols told trot and captain bill that the blue bands had assembled before the palace
then they all marched a little way into the fields and found that the army of pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily towards them
at the head of the pinkies were get guzzle and but him bright who had the parrot on his shoulder and there were supported by captain cori and captain t tent and rosy the witch
when the blue skin saw get cases they raised anthers great shout for he was the favourite of the soldiers and veryain popular with all the people
since last thursday i ghip guess all have been the lawful bloo of the blue country but nowt you are conquered by queen shot i suppose i am conquer too and you have no bloo at all
when he fished she said cheerfully
don't hy says o dear if all come right pretty soon
now then lets entred the city and enjoyed the great feast thats being cooked i nearly star myself for this conquering kingdoms as hard work
then she gave rosalie back her out to grin thanking the kinds which for all she had done for them
you are mat replied the sailor
will be such a satisfaction
the guards at a terrible struggle with the goat which was loose in the room and still wanted to fight but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the bloo out of the frame whose tied in and brought both him and the goat before queen trot who awaited them in the throne room of the palace
i'll gladly do that promised the new boolooroo and i'll fee the honourable goat all the shavings and lather and tin canes he gan eat b size the grass
excuse said short i nee g to tell you that you're not the boolooroo any more
the former boolooroo groaned
h i'll be wicked at any more s the old bloo i'll reformed
as a private citizen n shall be a model of deportment because it would be dangerous to be otherwise
when first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever but the blues who were as simple there all laughed at them endeared them for there was not a single person and a the blue country he loved the princesses the least little bit
so gi guesses or ordered the captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home
that evening trot gave a grand ball and the palace to which the most important of the pinkies in the blueskins were invited
the combine bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served
brighter than early dawns most brilliant die are blown clear bands of color through the sky that swirl and sweep and meet to break and foam like rainbow bills upon a bobbles dome
guided by you how we might stroll towards our only musick one another's breath through garden's intimate with hollyhocks where a silent poppies burned between the rocks by pools where birches ban to confidants above green waters scummy plans
venice
in a sun set glowing of crimson and gold she lives the glory of the world a beached kings galley who sails are furled who was hung with tapestries rich and old
the pity that we must come and though
while the old gold and the marvell's days for ever gleaming its soft strong blaze calm in the early evening glow
the pleasant gr yard of my soul with sentimental cypris trees and flowers is filled that i may stroll and meditation at my ease
it is my heart hung in the sky and no clouds ever float between the grave flowers and my heart on high
over the track line city street the young men the grinning man pass
ho yee sails that seemed to wonder and dream filled meadows say is the shore where i stand the only filled of struggle or are yee hit and battered th thereby waves and wust as heck over a clashing sea of watery echoes
old dances are simplified that their yarning bleached by time
he had got into her courtyards
through the black night rain he sang to her window bars
that was but rustling of dripping plants in the dark
she was alone that night
he had broken into her courtyards
to fad away like morning beauty from her mortal day down by the river of a donna her soft voices heard and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning d
o life of this are springing
why fades the lotus of the water
why fad these children of the spring
fell is like a watery bow and like a parting cloud like a reflection in a glass like shadows in the water like dreams of infants like a smile upon it infants face
like the debs voice like transient day like music in the air ah
and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gently here the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time
the lily of the valley breathing in the humble grass answered the lovely maiden said i am a water weeded and i am veryain smalls and loved to dwell in lowly veils so weak the gilded butterfly scarce purchase on my head yet i am visited from heavens and he that smiles on all walks in the valley and each mourn over me spreads his hand saying rejoice thou humble grass thou newborn lily flower
thou gentle made of silent valleys and of modest brooks for thou shall be clothed in light and fed with morning manna till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs to flourish in eternal veils they why should fell complain
why should the mistress of the veils of car utters
she ceased and smiled in tears then sat down in her silver shine
which thou dust scatter on everye little blade of grass that springs revives the milked cow and tames the fire breathing steed
but fell is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun i vanished from my pearly throne and who shall find my place
and why it scatters its bright beauty through the human air
descend a little cloud and hove before the eyes of fell
o little cloud the virgins said i charge thee to tell me why thou complains now when in one hour thou fad away then we shall seek thee but not finde ah fell is like to thee
i pass away yet i complain and no one hears my voice
the cloud then showed his golden head and his bright form emerged
and fierce thou because i vanish and and seen no more
it is too ten full life to love to peace and raptures wholly unseen descending way my light wings upon balmy flowers and court the fair i do to take me to her shining tent the weeping virgin trembling meals before the risen sun
till we arise linked and a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers
lives not alone nor of itself fear not and i will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice
come forth warm and the silent valley to thy pensive queen
the helpless wm arose and sat upon the lily's leaf and the bright clouds sail on to fined his partner in the vil
image of weakness art thou but a worm
i see they lay helpless the naked weeping and none to answer none to cherish thee with mother's smiles
and says thou mother of my children i have loved thee and i have given the a crown that none can take away
and lay me down and i cold bed and leave my shining lot
or an eye of gifts and graces showering fruits and coined gold
why a tongue impressed with honey from everye wind
why an ear a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in
al is said without a word
i sit beneath thy looks as children do in the noon son with souls that tremble through their happy eelids from an una verd yet pron gal inward joy
i did not wrong myself so but i placed a wrong on thee
when called before i told how hastily i dropped my flowers or break off from a game
shall i never miss home talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each in turn nor count it strange when i look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this
alas i have grieved so i am heard to love
open thy heart wide and fold within the wed wings of thy dove
could it mean to last a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow
nay i rather thrilled distrusting everye light that seemed to gill be onward path and fear to over lean a finger evenin
and though i have grown serene and strong since then i think that god his willed a still renew able fear
o love o troth
and love be false
if he to keep one oath must lose one joy by his life's star foretold
slowed to world greetings quick with its o list when the angel speak
a ringing of amethyst i could not wear here plainer too my sight than that first kiss
that was the chrism of love which loves own crowned with sanctifying sweetness did proceeded the third upon my lips was folded down in perfect purple state since when indeedy i have been proud and said my love my own
dearest teach me so to pour out gratitude as thou us good
muscle mens and guys through churches at a smile and half no ruth for any weeping
but thou are not such a lover my beloved
thou canst wait through sorrow and sickness to bringing souls to touch and think it soon when others cry too late
i think all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine
oh to shoot my souls full meaning into future years that they should lend it utterance and salute love that endure us from life that disappears
then i long tried by naturally oils received the comfort fast while budding at thy sight my pilgrim staff gave out green lees with morning dews
i love thee freely as men strive for right i loved thee purely as they turned from praise
i loved thee with the passion put to use in my old greeds in with my childhood's faith
i love thee with a love i seemed to lose with my lost saints i loved thee with the breath smile tears of all my life and if god choose i shall but love thee better after death
