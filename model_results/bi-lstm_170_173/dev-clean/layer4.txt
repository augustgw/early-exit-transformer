no letter had come no word of any kind and yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning
he saw that in the excitement of reason events he had not formulated a plan upon that score
he was getting some big comfort out of a goods oar but it was no pin sheaf for the ill which affected him
it was with great opposition after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial that at last he got a envelope placed in it the requested amount and slowly sealed it up
then he called harry the boy of all work around the place
you take this to this address he said handing him the envelope and give it to missus hurstwood yes sir said the boy
any answer i guess not
the boy hastened a way and the manager fell to his musings
he was beaten for to nighte and he might just as well make the bestest of it
she would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed
if he only have that letter back he wouldn't send it
bu relief he arose and joined in the conversation with a few friends who were drinking
all the time has thoughts would run out to his home and see the scene being there enacted
in about an hour and three quarters the boy returned
he danced as he sat as his desk that nothing would be done for a week or too mean mile he would have time to think
how about that now his pain at her failure to meet or right him rapidly increased as he devoted himself to the subjects
he decided to write her care of the west side post office and ask for an explanation as well as to have her meet him
three o'clock came for five six and no letter
the helpless manager past the floor and grimly endured the gloom of defeat
he saw a busy saturday ushered out the sabbaths and nothing done
all day the barbe closed he rita alone shut out from home from the excitement of his resort from carry and without thea ability to alter his conditioned one ida
it was the worst sunday he had spent in his life
it seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning
he was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angered of his perfidy
he had loved her earnestly enough but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive
he would go to her and tell her all his family complications
he would explained to her just where he stood and how much he needed her
he did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to carry but when he gott in ogden place he thought he saw a man matching him and went away
he did not go within a block of the house
he troubled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody
he stayed at his desk long after all others had gone and only quitted it when the nights watchman on his round pulled that the front door to see if it was safely locked
on wes day he received another polite note from mc gregor james and hay it read
dear sir we bent to inform me that we are instructed to wait until tomorrow thursday at one o'clock before piling suit against you on behalf missus julia hurstwood for divorce and alimony
very truely yours et cetera compromise
so here it was spred out clear before him and now he knew what to expects
if he didn't go and see them they would sew him promptly
preface to the second edition
this is a mistake though perfectly natural one
on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last revise to the pinner
then i had much pleasure in reading it but was indeed surprise that the many little points of similarity between the two books in spite of their entire independence to one another
i regret that reviewers have in some cases ven inclined to treat the chapters on machines as an attempt to reduce mister darwin's theory to an absurdity
i am surprised however that the book at which such an example of the specious ms use of analogy would see most naturally leveled should have occurred too review neither shall i mention the name of the poker though i should fancy that the hint given suffice
but this hadn effective of which i have little reason to complain for i was allowed almost to call them life long self deceivers to their faces and they said it was quite true but that it did not matter
i must not include without expressing my most sincere thanks to my critics and to the public for the leniency and consideration with which they have treated my adventures
it was written any upper rang a district of the canary province as it d was of muslin at appeared at christ church in the press newspaper june thirteenth eighteen sixty three
i also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the musical banks and the trial of a man for being in a consumption
i see from my second preface that i took the book to monsieur's chapman and hall may first eighteen seventy one and on their rejection of it under thee advice of one who is attained the highest drank amongst living writers i let it sleep till i took it to mister trubner early in eighteen seventy too
i attribute its looked for success mainly to two early favorable reviews the first in the palm gazette of april twelfth and the second in the spectator able twentieth
there was also another cause
the first addition of io on selden about three weeks i had not taken moulds and as the demand was strong it was set up again immediately
i made a few further very trifling alterations before moulds were taken but since the summer of eighteen seventy too as new a editions were from time to time wanted they have been printed from serials then made
i have still fairly well satisfied with those parts of ione that were repeatedly re written but from those that had only single writing i would gladly cut out some forty of fifty pages if i could
this however met thee for the copy right will probably expire in a little over twelve years
if the reader will excuse me i will say nothing of my antecedence nor of the circumstances which led me to leave my native country the narrative would be tedious to him in painful to myself
it will be seen that i did not succeeded to my design and that however much i may have met with that was new in strange i have been unable to reep any pecuniary advantage
no one who is himself honest thule doubt my being so
i reached my destination in one of the last months of eighteen sixty eight but i dare not mention the season lest the reader should gather in which hem sphere i was
sheep in cattle were introduced and bread with extreme rapidity men took up their fifty thousand or one hundred thousand acres of country going inland one behind the others till in a few years there was not an acre between the sea and the front ranges which was not taken up and stations either for sheep cattle were spotted about it intervals of some twenty or thirty miles over the whole country
i was delighted with the country and the manner of life
i was to see the sheep not necessarily close at hand or to get them in a single mob but to see enough of them here and there to feel easy that nothing had gone wrong this was no difficult matter for there were not ab eight hundred of them and being all breeding use they were pretty quiet
there were good many sheep which i knew as two or three black use and a black lamb or two and several others which had some distinguishing mark whereby i could tell them
it is surprizing how soon the eye becomes accustoms to missing twenty sheep out of two or three hundreds
it was a monotonous life but it was very healthy and one does not much mind anything when one as well
the country was the grandest that can be imagined
so lonely and so solemn with the sad grey clouds above and no sound save a lost lamb leading upon the mountainside as though was little heart were breaking
each must cry louder and wander farther yet may luc be with them both that they may find their own at nightfall
i had no money but if i could only find workable country i might stock it with borrowed capital and consider myself a maid man
there was no one in the whole world who had the smallest idea save those who were themselves on the other side of it if indeed there was anyone at all could i hoped cross it
i would tri a near arrange and see hel far i ga go
shortly after passing one of these chapels we came suddenly upon a village would started up out of the mist and i was alarmed lest i should be made an object of curiosity or dislike
my guides however were well known and the natural politeness of the people prevented them from putting me to any inconvenience but they could not help eyeing me nor i them
the streets were narrow and unpaved but very fairly clean
the vine gr outside many of the houses and there were some with signboards on which was painted a bottle and a glass that made me feel much at home
even on this ledge of human society there was a stunted growth of shop lots which had taken rot and vegetative somehow though as in an air mercantile of the blakiston
each feature was finished eelids eyelashes and ears being almost invariably perfects
their expression was divine and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips and great bewilderment i forgot all thoughts of their conversion and feelings that were far more earthly
evened middle agly they were still comely and the old great haired women at their cottage doors had a dignity not to say majesty of their own
the menw where's handsome as the women beautiful
i have always delighted in and reverenced beauty but i felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type a compound of all that his best in egyptian greek in italian
the children or infinite in number and exceedingly mary i need hardly said that they came in for their full share of the prevailing beauty
i expressed by signs my admiration and pleasure to my guides and they were greatly pleased
the country was highly cultivated every ledge being planted with chestnuts walnuts and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering
i saw a few sheep with rounded noses and enormous tiles
in about four hours of walking from the time we started and after passing too or three more villages we came upon a considerable town and my guides made many tempts to make the understand something but i gathered no angling of their meaning except that i needed be under no apprehension of danger
suffice that i found myself take him before the chief magistrate and by his orders was placed an an apartment with two other people who were the first i had seem looking anything but wile handsome
in fact one of them was plainly veryain much out of health and copped violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it
the other look pale and ill but he was marvelously self contained and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him
they felt my pulse they looked in my tongue they listened at my chest they felt all my muscles and had the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded and sits of the ina ton quite pleasant as though i were all right
but by a by they came to my watch which i hidden away in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search
i cid there was a very old carriage whose wheels in spite of bust in de kay i could see had been designed originally for iron rails
we pass many cases and at last came no one in which there were several clocks of two or three old watches
the desired was different but the thing was clearly the same
this head some effecting calming him
he began presently to relent and spoke to me in a kinder manner
imagine there was several kinds of old fashioned christmases but could hardly be worse than a chid my chambers or horror of horrors at the club were my cousin lucy's notion of what she calls the festive season
festive yes
the reply was written and a sprawling feminine hand it was a little vague
it appeared that the terms would be five guineas but there was an o mentions of the length of time which that fee would cover
the whole thing was a trip lad
there was nothing set about the sort of accommodation which would be provided nothing about the kind of establishment which was maintained or the table which was kept
now it is a remarkable thing that i have always had an extraordinary predilection for the a mag i do not know why
i have never known i mag and yet from my boyhood upward i have desired to meet one
under such circumstances she was hardly likely to be lively herself but her name was mag and it was the accident of her christian name which decided me to go
i had no allusions
i did not expected princely entertainment
all night it had been blowing and reigning
i felt quite lively myself as i mingled with the christmas crowd looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous
i even bought something from mag i mean missus wilson
it was a horrible journey
he was impervious to reason
it is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that i made it warmed for the officials however cold i might have been myself
when at last i reached croft in my journey's end it turned out that the station staff consisted of a half witted individual who was station master porter and clerk combined and a hulking lad who did whatever else there was to do
no one had come to meet me the village was about a half a mile and hanger dean the house for which my steps were bent about four miles by the road how far it was across cloud fields my informant did not mention
there was a trap at the boy and blunderbuss but that required fetched
when the trapped did appear it looked to me uncommonly like an opened spring cart
in it i was deposited with my luggage
i did not knowe what he meant
i did not ask i was beyond it
i was chilled to the bone wet tired hungry
i had long been wishing that an old fashioned christmas had been completely extinct before i had thought of adventuring in quest of one
he we be that might be so
there be the door and front of vie you go up three steps if you can find him
there's a knocker if none of e heaven twisted it off
there appeared to be no knocker though weather it had been twisted off was more than i could say
no answer though i allowed more than decent interval
bettering again suggested the driver hard
maybe there up to some of their games and wants rousing
the bell reverberated through what seemed like empty house
presently feet were heard advancing along the passage several pairs it seemed and i light gleam through the window over the door
a voic inquired whose there
the information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter
there was a rush of retreating feet an expostulating voice than darkness again and silence
who lives here are the people mad
i told the bell again
after a vast amount of unfastening the door was opened and on that threshold there stood a girl with a lighted candle in her hand
i mister christopher from london
we've lost the key of the cellar and there's nothing out except water and i don't think you'd care for that
her father as a most remarkable person to say the least
but it is quite plain to meet that all the arrangements for my wedding are going to be made by the snelling
i do not know when it is going to be but it will be either next week or the week after certainly at the earliest possible moment and i shouldn't be at all surprised to learn that all marianne's things have been already bought and perhaps some of them marked
it is most delightful
it might just as well be someone else is wedding so un important is the part which i am set to play in it
p instance look at their behaviour in the matter of the ring
the accident and question occurred upon the sunday evening
the girl is frend in but you don't seem to notice it
i guessed positively gasped
that's it on your recount
from a cousin of ours whose in that line
i never saw a people like the snelling for possessing relatives and aloes of lines
i was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a prophet out of marian's engagement ringing but i handed over the amount
it is from her action in that matter that my suspicion springs
there she owns a cottage or it may be a pigsty for all i know
when she heard of my engagement with marianne she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honeymoon in her cottage or pigsty and that i should pay her rent for it
there were no signs of faltering about her flow of language
i found that is a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations
it turned out that she had a little money of her own about a hundred and thirty pounds a year
and of course i had my expectations and she had hers
it was plain that together we should manage most comfortably delightfully in fact
i shall make papa give me five hundred pounds at least
a bird in the hand is worth two in a bush and it will be something to have by us
i know what mamma and aff to give and i will see if she gives it
and i will see that there is no shirking about the boys or about the girls either
i have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us present and i shall tell them what they ought to givee it won't be my fault if i don't get it
of course there are some people with whom you can't be perfectly plain but i shall be as plain as i can there's away and a manner of doing that kind of thing
hers has been prodigious
she has a nack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants which is a little short of miraculous
i noticed that they are generally persons who have already tendered their offerings
the fact of having given marianna wedding present seems to fill them with a feeling of rancorous acidity which to me inexplicable
such as the selfishness of human nature
but why and that account they should pity me i ought together fail to understand
we have all been giving maryann presence and i suppose you mister widing have been giving her something too
that was what missus mac parson said to me only the other day
and what inquired missus mack pherson has maryann given you her love
some u snared
i cannot pretend explain why except on the supposition that romances dead at least in that circle of society in which the snelling is move
as it is unless i am mistaken some of the rending will be on our side and they know it
pius the cards are out for the wedding
we are going for our honeymoon to italy and the south of france
a second cousin of marys is in the cooks tours line
he has given us free passes all the way to the end of our journey and all the way back again and coops for freeboard and lodging at the hotel it's a wedding present
besides which we can always sell the coops and railway passes which we don't use
he was young no spear had touched him no poison lurked in his wine
i tell you it is not poison she cried
since his birth he has been guarded so closely that the cleverest poisoners of the east could not reach him
as you will know there are ten men and ten women who so duty is to taste his food and wine and fifty armed warriors guard his chamber as they guarded now
a l confused mong wain from his mouth
the man shrugged his broad shoulders and turned back into the arabesque chamber
this man was clad in a browned camel hair roll and sandals and a green turban was on his head
not until the heavens were in the proper order could they performed this necromancer
with a long stained fingernail he m the constellations on the marble tiled floor
the slant of the moon pressed evil for the king of via the stars are internal the serpent in the house of the elephant
point of contact inquired the others
all discarded portions of the human body still remained part of it attached tow it by intangible connections
but at the urged entreaty of the princess of casa who loved bund the chan vi he gave her a lock of his long black hair as a token of remembrance
by which a soul is drawn from its body and across gulfs of echoing space returned the man on the mat
on the days under the golden dome the king cried out again wracked by awful paroxysms
they seek to snapped the silver cord that bes me to my dying body
they cluster around me their hands are talented their eyes are red like flame burning and darkness
their finger seer me like fire
i know now what brings me to the pier
there they strolled to break the silver cord of life and thrust my soul into the body of a foul night weird their sorcery summoned up from hell ah
you'll cry and the grip of your fingers brought me back but i am going fast
there was the old imperious note in his failing whisper
you have never disobey me oby my last command
send my soul cream to assure
they also found a martian calendar the year had been divided into ten more or less equal months and one of them had been da
bill chamber theologist heaven been going deeper and deeper into the old sea bottom of sits
that took the centre of interest away from archology and started a new burst of activity
the civilian specialist in other fields and the space force people who had been holding tape lines and making sketches and snapping cameras were all flying to lower sirius to find out home much oxygen there was and what kind of life it supported
they had four five species of what might loosely be called birds and something that could easily be classed as a reptile and a carnivorous mammal the size of a cat with birdlike claws and a herb vor almost identical with a pig like thing in the big dar hull a merle and another like a gazelle with a single horne in the middle of its forehead
the daily news cast from tara showed a corresponding shifting interest at home
tones found the martians
it was locked from inside and we had burnet down with a torch that's where they are
glory standish who had dropped in for lunch was on the meanin fairly screaming into a radio pon extension doesn't an half of them
well of course there dead what a questioned
martha remembered the close door on the first survey they hadn't attempted opening it
now it was burned away at both sides and lay still hot along the edges on the floor of the big office room in front
a flood light was on in the room inside and latimer was going around looking at things while the space force officers stood by the door
mass suicide that's what it was notice whats in the corners
yes charcoal
so they just came in here and lit the charcoal and sat drinking together till they all fell asleep
the tarring public wanted to hear about martians and if live martians couldn't be found a room full of dead ones was the next best thing
tony latimer the discoverer was beginning to cashing on his attentions to gloria and his ingratiation with sid he was always either making voice and image talks for teas or listening to the news from the home planet
without questioned he had become overnight the most widely known archologist in history
not that i'm interested in all this for myself he disclaimed after listening to the tell cas from tara two days after his discovery
bringing it to the public attention dramatize it
so i believe i shall go back at least for awhile and see what i can do
lectures
the organization of a society of martian archology with ant any latimer p aged the logical candidate for the chair
i'll be glad to try sir he replied

an instant later it crashed over pinning mark favor beneath it
bu through up his arms to protected himself but too late
for minutes no one stirred among the wreckage
then tome who had been stunned by some falling de brie raised himself to a sitting positions
tom's eyes focus in horror on the wreckage enveloped by still billowing dust
the sky was visible through several gaping holes in the roof which was sagging dangerously on its supporting tresses
the younger viner had just noticed his friend lying pin beneath a heavy beam near by
his friends eyelids flickered
we'd better not try to move him tom decided will get an ambulance
they picked their way through the wreckage and emerged on a scene of frightful destruction
let see about getting help for mister favor
and the only truck we had available was in that burnings shed the superintendent added bitterly
anyhow we want to help got a job for us
within minutes tom was in charge of clearing away rubble and extricating any one who might be trapped inside the buildings
the telephone line was soon repaired and a steady stream of rescue vehicles began arriving from harkness fire trucks three ambulances and private cars driven by volunteers
the two girls were as much upset as tom's mother tom laughed
mister swift came into the living room just then and told tom how worried missus swift and sandy had been
he smiled guiltily as he added but i must admit i was more than a little concerned myself
he's a great scientist
tom nodded unhappily

mister swift's eyes twinkled

glenarvan's voice firm till now faltered

these forest were of trees different in someways from those we have now great ferns as tallest his house and motes as high its little trees and pal leaves of enormous size

one who rights of such an ear a labors under a troublesome disadvantage
in the present case that disadvantage is doubled for while the sends of the church however haines were still such as admit of being expressed in words this ends of the heathen world against which she fought were utterly indescribable and the christian apologist is thus compelled for the sake of decency to state the church's case far more weakly than the facts deserve

there is fruit with lyles and rice waiting for you in the next room and bread and the su expires it too much
strange that men should be content to grovel and to be men when they might rise to the rank of gods
not that such a creature as is that disturbs me no created thing i hope can move my equanimity but if i could stoop to hate i should hate her hate her
and her voice took a tone which made it somewhat uncertain weather in spite of all the lofty impassibility which she felt bound to possess she did not hate pelagia with a most human and mond hatred
his excellency madam the prefects
and why should that disturb me let him enter
sh a rambles and moto memories
arctic beauty and desolation with their blessings and dangers may be found here to test the endurance and skill of adventurous climbers but far better than climbing the mountain is going around its warmed fertile base enjoying its bounties like a bee circling around of bank of flowers
perhaps the profession of doing goods may be full but everybody should be kind at least to himself
go quietly alone no harm will before you
but it is far better to go a foot
one blanket will be enough to carry or you may forego the pleasure and burden altogether as wood for fires as everywhere abundant
only a little food will be required
thus one saunters on and on in the glorious radiance and utter peace and forgetfulness of time
yet strange to say there are days even here somewhat dull looking when the mountain seems uncommunicative sending out no appreciable invitation as if not at home
at such time its height seems much less as if crouching in weary it were taking rest
everye crystal dances responsive to the touches of the sun and the currents of sap in the growing cells of all the vegetation are ever in a vital worl and rush and though many feet in wings are folded how many are a stir
slight rains arms are likely to be encountered in a trip brown the mountain but when may easily fine shelter beneath well fetched trees that shed the rain like a roof
then the shining of the wet leaves is delightful and the steamy fragrance and the burst of birds song from the multitude of thrushes and finches and warblers that have nests in the chapparal
a thousand thousand voices are heard but so finally blended they seem a park of the night itself and make a deeper silence
and setting out from strawberry valley by bearing off to the northwestward a few miles you may see
in approaching it it suspicious looking yellow spotted hood and watchful attitude will be likely to make you go cautiously through the bog where it stands as if you were approaching a dangerous snake
it is lined with ambled aging and mosses and shaded with alder willow and thorn bushes which give it a fine setting
it is three or four miles long and terminates at an elevation of about nine thousand five hundred feet above sea level in moraine sprinkled ice class sixty feet high
the long grey slopes leading up to the glacier seen remarkably smooths unbroken
most of the drainage of the glacier vanishes at once in the porous rocks to appearance springs and the distant valley and it is only in time of flood that the channel carries much water then there are several fine falls in the gorge six hundred feed more and height
chasing this wild changing channel gorge gi your canyon the sections will show mount shasta as a huge palps containing the records layer upon lair of strange contrasted events in its fiery i see history
regaining the low ground at the base of the mountain and holding on in your grand orbit you pass though belt of juniper woods called the cedars to sheep bog at the foot of the shasta pass
here he strike the old emigrant road which leads over the low divided to the eastern slopes of the mountain
not bremer as the most noted strong hold of the sheep in the whole shasta region
large flocks tell here from earthy year winter and summer descending occasionally into the adjacent sa plans in lave beds to feed but ever ready to take refuge in the jagged crags of their mountain and every alarm
while travelling with a company of hunters i saw about fifty in one flock
the meal deer are nearly as heavy
their long massive ears give them a very striking a parents
b neither the glorified woods on the one hand now the lake on the other could it first hold the eye
then fell the glooming making everything still more forbidding in mysterious
then darkness like death
two or three miles farther on is the main strong hold of the modoc held by them so long and defiantly against all the soldiers that could be brought to the attack
the docks less weary kept the places merely swimming in out through openings in the rushes rippling the glassy water and raising spangles in their wake
they brought rugged craved cloud like masses of down grinding ice pouring forth streams of muddy water as measures of the work they are doing and sculptural the rocks beneath them very unlike the long majestic glaciers of alaska that river like go winding down the valleys though the forests to the sea
thus the chester river issues from a large lake like springing and chest a valley and about two thirds of the volume of them a cloud gushes forth in a grand springing on east side the mountain a few miles back from its immediate base
should the volume of the stream where you strike it seemed small then you will know that you are above the springing if large nearly equal to its volume at its confluence with the pit river then you are below it and an either case have only to fallow the river up or down until you come to it
under certain conditions you may hear the roar of the water rushing from the rock at distance of half a mile or even more or you may not hear it until within a few rods
the vivid green of the boulders beneath the water is very striking and colours the entire stream with the exceptions of the portions broken into fun
a asplenium it blob who cara hazel dogwood and alder make a luxurious fringe and setting and the forests of duglas bruce along the banks are the finest i have ever seen in the ser
tracing rivers to their fountains makes the most charming travels
as the life blood of the landscapes the best of the wilderness comes to their banks and not one dull passages found in all their eventful histories
tring them m cloud to its highest springs and over the divided to the fountains of fall river near fort crook bents down that river to its confluence with the pit on from there to the volcanic region about lassen's beaut through the big meadows among the sources of the feather river and down through forests of sugar pine to the fertile plans of che co this is glorious sauer and imposes no hardship
the ascent of lassen's beaut is an easy walk and a views from the summit are extremely telling
the lofty icy shasta towering high above all seems but an hours walk from you though the distance in an air line is about sixty miles
the bigg meadows l near the foot of lessons beaut a beautiful spacious basin set in the heart of the richly forced mountains scarcely surpassed in the grander of its surroundings by tow
the great wilds of our country once held to be boundless and inexhaustible are being rapidly invaded and over run in everye direction and everything destructible in them being destroyed
everye landscape low and high seems doom to be trampled and harried
when we took our seats at the breakfast table it was with the feeling of being no longer looked upon as connected in anyway with this case
instantly they absorbed all my attention though i dared not givee them a director look and continued to observe them only in the glass
yes and a very respectable one
the lady is not the mother of the boys but their aunt
the boys belong to the gentleman who is a widower
george nodded
the boys would quite awaken of his the father does not
do they still insist that miss challoner was the only person in the room with them at this time
george
have you ever thought that she might have beens aside
i know its sounds foolish but the alternative is so improbable
the boys look white awake enough but who can tell i would sooner believe that
a man was looking in from the corridor behind at the four persons we were just discussing
i enquired of george with my eyes still on the furtive watcher
i took a quite fancy to him why
i am looking at him now
just in everyday detective but ambitious i suppose and quite alive to the importance of being though
yes hes mercurial in all his movements
what does he want
i asked as soon as george had returned to my side
he wants me to stand ready to obey any summons the police may sent me
i emphasized complacently
he appeared to know for he tolde me at once that he was detective gryce a man who had grown old in solving just such baffling problems as these
he gave up work sometime ago i have been told my husband went on but ev nly a great case still has its learn meant for him
the trail here must be a very revery blinded one for them to call him in
i wish we had not left so soon
he was late of course but when he did appear i almost forgot o usual greeting in my hurry to ask him if he had seen the evening papers
however a little later we had a comfortable chat
it was one which gave me a small triumph over george
the suggestion he had laughed at was not so entirely foolish as he had been pleased to considerate
their greeting was cordial and the lines on the latter's face relaxed i little as he met the still bright eye of the man upon whose instinct m judgment so much reliance had always been placed
this is very revery good of you he began glancing down ath the aged detective s bundled up legs and gently pushings a chair towards him
it's the most inexplicable there
but clues there are absolutely none
that is we have not been able to find any perhaps you pan
at least that is what we hope
it's a case in a thousand gryce
the old man's eyes shot fire and unconsciously one foot slipped to the floor
she had no companions near her
no word no cry just a collapse and sudden fall
in olden days they would have said struck by a bolt from heavens
what do you make of it gryce
i should like to see the desk you speak of and the spot where she fell
a young fellow who had been hovering in the background that once stepped forwards
he was the plain faced detective who had spoken to george
this sweetwater as they called him was i have since understood one of his pe je and more or less a favorite
then over the ground study to the affair carefully
veryain well then your in opposition to pre near me
well well that's honest at all events
but i am in no positions to make promises
old days don't returned for the asking
whether he got anything else it would be impossible to say from his manner as he finally sank into a chair by one of the openings and looked down on the lobby below
what or two of the musicians from the end of the hall
naturally they reached her first
mark sour be and clouds heno burg
honest germans men who have played here for years
who came next on the scene some people from the lobby
hey body before the father came in
yes miss clark the middle aged to lady with the perishes
i suppose she has been carefully questioned perry i should say
and she speaks of no weapon
not till the doctor came her dog drew was happily in his office in this very building
yes mister slater the assistant mater who was a mob at the time says that minutes at least must have elapsed
noor doubt
sweetwater some one drew that weapon out
not altogether by me
wherever she pleases only i can't walk far
it has not been running since last night or it would be full of curious people all the time hustling to get a glimpse of this place
but they'll put a man on for you
very goode managed as you will
i'll way tear till your ready explain yourself to the lady tell her i'm an old and romantic invalid who has been used to asking his own questions
as her quite figure appeared in the doorway sweetwater stole a glance at mister gryce
there was no doubting them in this instance
yes
for some little time that is it seemed long though i believe it was not more than a minute before two men came running from the musician's gallery
yes many times
what made the difference
miss clark started and her sweet face showed a moments perplexity did i she quarried musingly
no a veryain natural one i will should say
and the glance she cast him while not meeting his eyes showed that she understood the importance of the admission
i know she said what you are going to ask me now
there was no pared in the wound
the time is marrow down to one and e that one miss clark was the only person to touch her
i will trouble you know further
sweetwater health me out of this
but vigor returned to him before he had well reached the door and he showed some of his old spirit as he thanked miss clark and turned to take the elevator
the next minute she was in this ladys arms
no weapon protruded from the w nor was any found on or near her in the mesa what follows
she struck the blow herself and the strength of purpose which led her to do this gave her the additional force to pull the weapon out and fling it from her
it did not fall upon the floor around her therefore it flew through one of those openings into the lobby and there it either will be or husband fou
with the education which o to have insured me an honorable standing in the worlds with some intelligence wit good literary and scientific knowledge and endowed with those accidental physical qualities which are such a good passport into society i found myself at the age of twenty the mean follower of a sublime are in which if great talent is rightly admired mediocrity is as rightly despised
i was compelled by poverty to become a member of a musical band in which i could expected neither esteem nor consideration and i was well aware that i should be the laughing stock of the persons who had known me as a doctor in divinity as ecclesiastic and as an officer in the army and had welcome me in the highest society
i felt that in my first profession as i was not blessed with the vocation necessary to it i should have succeeded only by din to hypocrisy and i should have been despicable in my own estimation even if i had seen the purple mantle on by shoulders for the greatest dignities cannot silence a man's own conscious
besides i was of opinions that a man's profession whatever it might be o to supply him with enough money to satisfy all his once and the very poor pay of an officer would never have beens sufficient to cover my expenses because my education had given me greater once the those of officers and general
o scandalous proceedings often exposed us the greatest danger
we would very often spend the whole night rambling about the city inventing in carrying and execution the most impertinent practical jokes
we did the same with physicians whom we often sent half dressed to some nobleman who was enjoying excellent health
whenever we could contrive to get into a church tower we thought it great fund a frightened all the perish by ringing the alarm bell is if some fire had broken out but that was not all we always cut the bell ropes so that in the morning the churchwardens had no means of summoning the faithful to early mass
this is the amusing adventure which closed our exploits
in everyone of the seventy two perishes of the city of venice there is a large publick house caught magazine
yet there are of few private rooms which contain a table surrounded with benches in which a respectable family or a few friends can enjoyed themselves in a decent way
the waiter of the mazuma came to be paid and our chief gave him what was deu in joining silence under penalty of death
we took out three prisoners to a large bow
where is my husband
never fear you shall see him again to morrow
my readers may imagine whether we felt inclined to laugh when the charming creature batest good night thinking us all with perfected good faith
two days afterwards are nocturnal orgy began to be talked of
and went on to say that the two men who had carried her off had taken her to such a place where they had and hour later been met by the other six and that they had all repaired to the two swords where they had spent an hour and drinking
there was no cowardly trader amongst us although we were all poor but fear had its effects and i maternal pranks were not renewed
i picked it up and coming up to him just as he was going down the steps i handed it to him
i told him and he insisted upon my coming with him in the gondola saying that he would leave me at my house
i rubbed it with all my strength but he told me in a sort of indistinct whisper that the numbness was spreading all along the left side and that he was dying
i jumped out of the garda and fought myself on the veryain spot where three years before i had tal retta such a forcible lesson i inquired for a surgeon at the first coffeehouse and ran to the house that was pointed out to me
taking everything upon myself i ordered a servant to hurry out for a physician who came in a short time and ordered the patient to be blood again thus approving the first bleeding prescribed by me
thinking i had the right to watch the sic man i settled myself near his bed to give him every care he required
it did not know who i was and den like to ask me whilst i thought it better to preserve a modest silence
he had gambled and lost a great deal and his brother was as most bitter enemy because he was infatuated with the idea that he had tried to poison him
the physician who attended him was named tero he thought by some peculiar train of reasoning that he could cure him by applying and the curio oath ment to the chest to which no one raised any objection
delighted with such a fortunate result we lay down again
he entreated me to tell him the truth
what extraordinary things will sometimes occur from mere chance or from the force of circumstances
unwilling to h his vanity by telling him that he was mistaken i took the wild resolution of informing him in the presence of his two friends that i possessed a certain numeral calculus which gave answers also in numbers to any questions i like to put
i obeyed implicitly and met your excellency
the three fads were a stowed it
i declared myself quite willing for it was necessary to brazen it out after having ventured as far as i had done
he wrote the questions and gave it to me i read it i couldn understand either the subject or the meeting of the words but it did not matter i had to gi an answer
if the questioned was so obscure that i couldn make out the sense of it it was natural that i should not understand the answer
they all ask me how long i would require to teach in the rules of my sublime calculus
not very longing i answered aunt i will teach you as you wish although the hermit assured me that i would die suddenly within three days if i communicated my science to any one but i have no faith whatever in that prediction
they believed that through me they possessed the philosophers stone the universal pence of the intercourse with all the elementary heavenly and infernal spirits and they had no doubt whatever that thanks to my sublime science they could find out the secrets of every government in europe
but although believing fully in my oracles they were too kindhearted to think them the work of the double and en suited their natural goodness better to believe my answers inspired by some heavenly spirit
there were not only good christians and faithful to the church but even real devotees and full of scruples
as for the e crest trans substantiation the real presence it was all no mystery to them but palpable evidence and yet they were not jesuits
i might be told that if i had wished to follow the rules of pure morality i aught either to have declined intimate intercourse with them or to have undeceived them
besides i found it very flattering to my vanity to become the subjects of the spected live chattering of empty fools who having nothing oust the do and always trying to find out the cause of everye moral phenomena they mae with which their narrow intellect cannot understand
whoever you may be i am indeed to you for my life
your apartment is ready you may sender close you shall have a servant a gone dollah at your orders my own tablet ten sequins a month

i threw myself at his feet to assure him of my gratitude and embraced him calling him my father
sir edwards not wholly discouraged by the denial with which door forth had with delicacy acquainted him still hoped for a kind receptions and was so often at the house of missus horton that lord frederick's jealousy was excited and the tortures he suffered in consequence convinced him beyond a doubt of the sincerity of his affection
every time he beheld the object of his passion for he still continued his visits though not so frequently as here to four he pleaded his cause with such ardour that miss woodley who was sometimes present and ever compassionate could not resist wishing him success
yet did the watchful miss woodley often times here a sigh escape from her unknown to herself till she was reminded of it and then a sudden blush would instantly overspread her face
night after night his sleep had been disturbed by fears for her w abroad mourning after morning it had been broken by the clamour of her return
i hope miss miller you pass this evening at home'
i thought miss milner you gave me your wor that you would pass this evening at home
yes indeed and i believe it is right that i should keep my first promise is it not
missus horton rose from her seat moved the decanters and fruit round the table stirred the fire and came back to her seat again before another word was uttered
nor had this good woman's officious labors taken the least from the awkwardness of the silence which as soon as the bustle she had made was over returned in its full force
miss milner you shall not leave the house this evening sir
and he walked immediately out of the apartment by another door
her hand fell motionless from that which she held she appeared motionless herself till missus horton beseeching her not to be uneasy at the treatment she had received made her tears flow as if her heart was breaking
it was not from any real cause of grief that she wept but there was a magnetic quality in tears which always attracted hers
do you think i would go answered miss milner with an eagerness that for a times oppressed her tears in contradiction to his will
if you think so mather i see nothing that should prevent me now
niece i command you not to stir out of the room is evening
miss woodley obediently sat down and though her thoughts and heard were in the chamber of her friend she never marked by one impertinent word or by one line of her face the restraint she suffered
at the usual hour mister door fore and his word summoned to tea he entered with a countenance which evinced the remains of anger his eye gave testimony of his absent thoughts and though he took up a pant effecting to read it was plain to discern that he scarcely knew he held it in his hand
miss woodley thought it her duty to be mute and now the jingle of a teaspoon was like a deep toned bell all was so quiet
missus horton too in the self approving reflection that she was not in a quarrel or altercation of any kind felt herself at this moment remarkably peaceful and charitable
miss woodley did not recollect herself so but was so in reality in her a peason charity were instinctive virtues accident could not increase them
he coughed drank his tea endeavor to talk but found difficult sometimes red and in this manner near two hours were passed away when miss mille came into the room not dressed for a ball but as she had risen from dinner
dora forth red on and seemed afraid of looking up lest he should see what he could not have pardoned
after a few lin its pause and some little embarrassment on a part of missus horton at the disappointment she had to encounter from this unexpected dutiful conduct she asked miss milner if she would now have any tea
dora forth then laid the book out of his hand and by the time the servant had left the room thus began
it is often the ungrateful task of a friend to be troublesome sometimes un mannerly
forgive the duties of my office and believe that no one is half so much concerned if it robs you of any degree of happiness as i myself am
what he said he looked with so much sincerity that had she been burning with rage at his late behaviour she must have forgiven him for the regret which he so forcibly expressed
she was going to reply but found she could not without accompanying her words with tears therefore after the first attempt she desisted
on this he rose from his chair and going to her said once more show your submission by obeying me a second time today
keep your appointment and be assured that i shall issue my commands with more circumspection for the future as i find how strictly they are complied with
in the last communication which he had received from lady milburgh she had scolded him in terms that were for her severe because he had not returned to his wife and taken her off with him to naples
and now had come to pass that his soule remaining ally mister samuel basle the ex policemen was becoming weary of his service
at last he sent wor to say that he himself would be in england before the end of march and would see that the majesty at the law should be vindicated in his favor
in making this he had expected no success though from the energetic nature of his disposition he had made the attempt with some zeal
missus bazil was disposed to think that ladies equality among whom madame tea was entitled in her estimation to take rank were seldom better than they ought to be and she was quite willing that her husband should earn his bread by watching the lady or the lady's lover
and had the case been brought before the judge ordinary by means of her husband's exertions she would have taken pleasure in reading everye word of the evidence even though her husband should have been ever so roughly handled by the lawyers
a distinct promise of a hundreds pounds was made to him if he would have the childs ready to hand over to tra val on travilla's arrival in england
of course it eight said missus basle
the paternal parent has a right to his infants no doubt that was basil's law
he can't suckle him canny
when a married woman has followers and the husband don't go the wrong side of the post too or ain't proved again him that he do they'll never let her have nothing to do with the children
i'll tell you what it is be exclaimed missus basle it's my believe as he ain't quite right up here and missus basle touched her forehead
dread him all what is it they wants they don't know what they wants
it's that is makes him i won't say what
but as for this here childe
travelin had followed his letter quicker than he had intended when it was written and was now with his prime minister before his prime minister had been able to take any action on the last instruction received
does one mister samuel basle live here asked tra val
then basle came forward and introduced his wife
but tra vallon was of a different opinions and he was disgusted and revolted most unreasonably by the appearance of his minister's domestic arrangements
bazil had always waited upon him with a decent coat and a well brushed hat and clean shoes
it is veryain much easier for such men as is mister basle to carry decency of appearance about with them to keep it at home
perhaps you could put on your coat and walk out with me for a few minutes said turban
missus basle who well understood that business was business and that wives were not business felt no anger at this and handed her husband his best coat
basle away from his own home out on business with his coat buttoned over his breast and his best half in his hand was awar that he commanded respects and he could carry himself accordingly
i do not suppose that anybody will questioned my right to have the care of my own childs said travelin
if you would have gone to mister skin sir suggested ble
as he went about his eyes were ever cast downwards and he walked with a quick shuffling gate and he suspected others feeling that he himself was suspected
and all works had ceased with him
he's up and ser a minding of his parliamentary duties
i've watched her his sharp as watching can go pretty near
but if you ask me my opinions why in course they been together somewhere
and basle as he said this smiled almost alowed
and he did go away leaving basle standing in the middle of stony walk
master and man dismounted from their beasts and as soon as they had settled themselves at the foot of the trees sancho who had had a good noon time meal that day let himselfe without mord passed the gates of sleep
but don quixote whom his thoughts far more than hunger kept awake could not close that e and road and fancy to and fro through all sorts of places
at one moment it seemed to him that he was in the cave of multi sins and saw dulcinea transformed into a country wench skipping and mounting upon her shes again that the words of the sage merlin were sounding in his ears setting forth the conditions to be observed and exertions to be made for the disenchantment of dulcinea
al is stating me and id dressing me
dos is perishing thou art living on regardless i am dinging of hop deferred therefore uns thyself with a goodwill for mine it is here in this retired spot to give the at least two thousand glashes
seeing this sancho got up and grappling with his master he gripped him with all his might in his arms giving him a trip with the heel stretched him on the ground on his back and pressing his right mee on his chest held his hands in his own so that he could neither move nor breathe
how no tre exclaimed don't your day
dust dour re bolt against thy master and natural lord
does thou rise against him who gives thee his bread
don quixote gave his promise and swore by the life of his thoughts not to touch so much as a hair of his garments and to leave him entirely free and to his own discretion to whip himself whenever he pleased
sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot but as he was about to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touch his head and putting up his hands encountered somebody's two feet with shoes and stockings on them
he trembled with fear and made for another tree where the veryain same thing had happened to him and he fell a shouting calling upon don quality to c and protective him
dont qui o te did so and ask him what had happened to him and what he was afraid of
sancho replied that all the trees were full of min's feet and legs
don quixote was on foot with his horse unbridled and his lance leaning against a tree and in short completely defenseless he thought it best therefore to fold his arms and bow his head and reserve himself for a more favourable occasioned and opportunity
he was mounted upon a powerful horse and had on a coat of male with four of the pistols they call perils in that country at his waist
he saw that his squires for so they called those who follow that trade were about to rifle sancho panza but he ordered them to desist and was at once obeyed so the girdle escaped
he saw me he paid court to me i listened to him and unknown to my fathers high loft him for there is no woman however secluded she made live w close she may be kept who will not have opportunities and despair for following her head long impulses
in a word he pledged himself to be mine and i promised to be his without carrying matter se any further
give me my horse and arms and wait from me here i will go in quest of this night and deader alive i will make him keep his word plighted to so great beauty
nobody need have any doubt about that said sancho for my master has a very happy nack of mac making it's not many days since he forced another man to mary who in the same way backed out of his prose to another maiden and if it had not been for his persecutors the enchanters changing the man's proper shap int to a lacks the said maiden would not be one this minute
they made haste to overtake them which as the party moved slowly they were able to do with these
the wounded gentleman opened his all but closed eyes and recognizing claudia said i see clearly fair and mistaken lady that it is thou that h slain me a punishment not merited or deserved by my feeling story for never did i mean to nor could i wrong me in thought or deed

on perceiving this claudia when she had convinced herself that her beloved husband was no more rent the air with her size and made the heaven's ringing with her lamentations she tore her hair and scattered int to the winds she beat her face with her hands and showed all the signs of grief and sorrow that could be conceived to come from an inflected heart
cruel reckless woman she cried how easily worth thou moved to carry out a thoughts a wicked
o husband whose unhappy fate and being mine hath borne me from the barrage bed to the grave
the servants wept cody swooned away again and again and the whole place seemed to field of sorrow and an a bold of misfortune
claudia told him she meant to go to a monastery of which an a of hers was a abase where she intended to pass her life with a better and everlasting spouse
claudia would not on any account allow him to accompany her and thanking him for his offers as well as she could took leave of him in tears
sancho said they had but that three kerchiefs that were were three cities were missing
what are you talking about man
said one of the bystanders i have got them and they are not worth three you reals
at this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels on the roads to watch you who came along them and report what pass to their chief came up and said signor there is a great thrup of people not far off coming along the road to barcelona
what led me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance which is strum enough to disturbed the quietest hearts
and if you have any desire to shorten the journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation come with me and i will show you how to become a night errant a calling wherein so many hardships in mishaps are encountered that if they be taken his penances who will loge you in heaven in a trice
and now the squires dispatched to make the prize came up bringing with them two gentlemen on horseback two pilgrims on foot and a coach ful of women with some six servants on foot and on horseback and attendants on them and a couple of mule tears whom the gentleman had with them
the captain showed plainly the concerned they felt the regions lady was downcast and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy see their property confiscated
the regions lady ordered one of her servants to give the eighty grounds that had been assess as her share at once for the captains had already paid down their sixty
one of the squires observed in his mixture of gascon and cattle this captain of ours would make a better fire than highway man if he wants to be so generous another time let it be with his own property and not hours
they were all taken back and not one of them dared to utter a word such deference did they pay him
he'd been a clerk in banking house and was transported form blent though by some grave doubts as to his guilt were entertained
when the muster bell rang and that game broke up rufus daws on his silent way to a separate cell observed a notable changeling the dispositions of the new convict
i'm not to go in there says the ex bank clerk drawing back and dismay from the cloud of fell faces which lord upon him
what is he more than anybody else said the wretched man to himself as he hugged his misery close

so they went on too the veranda and looked down upon the lights of the prison and listened to the sea lapping the shore

dead said doctor macklin
delighted to see mister macon
the mal wane was tired and wanted to get home
our roads lie together doctor

mister meek and express some alarm but doctor mack wane reassured him
we can't do anything without evidence complaining
i shall find my port mono in my room you said yes yes
he sleeps at the back and north hurried off
an impulsive gentleman said makin mack wane as a sound of mister north's footsteps died away in the distance

he mixed a teaspoon of this in a panic and of water and drank it
it relieved him for a while
it was as though he had reached the crisis of a disease which had been for days gathering force
i must have a teaspoonful he said to lay the craving
twice he paused on the way to the sitting room and twice was he driven on by a power stronger than his will
he smelt the nett a rome of the spirit
that at all times debasing at this particular time it was infamous that a vice unworthy of any man was doubly sinful in a man of education and a minister of gone in vain
in the midst of his arguments he found himself at the cupboard the bottle l at his lips in an attitude that was at once ludicrous and horrible
her meeting with letty was indescribably tender and the days set followed were pretty equally divided between her and her brother in nursing the one and loving the others
but even while she enjoyed every hour of life and begrudged the time given to sleep she felt as if the dream was too beautiful to last of and said
so christy turned to deaf to her prophetic soul and gave herself up the blas ful holiday that had come at last
nothing conan surprised me now i prepared for anything even the sight of my quakerish lover dancing a dick

then they went back to their work little dreaming as they tied roses in twine sim lax rives how near that other chance was how soon they were to be called upon to keep their promise and how well each was to performed the part given them in life and death
to know home in the land did the great trouble bringing more sudden changed th the little cottage in the lane
david was sober enough now and went about his work with a grim set to his lips and a spark in his eyes that made the three women look at one another pale with unspoken apprehension
it is terrible in yet glorious
david held it close in both of his saying gratefully thank you mother then fixing his eyes on the younger yet not dearer women he added with a ringing in his voice that made their heart answer with a prompt eye aye in spite of love or fear
the boys bless their brave hearts have done nobly but older men are needed now we cannot sacrifice all the gallant lads and we who have more to lose and they must take our turn and tried to do as well
yes david sister and sweetheart answered bravely forgetting in the fervor of the moments what heavy consequences god might see fit to s good

next evening as missus sterling set alone in the twilight a told man in a me blue entered quietly stood watching the tranquil figure for a moment then went and knelt down beside at saying with a most unsold choking the voice
the loyal frenzy fell upon the three quiet women and they could not do too much for their country
it would have taken many knapsacks to hold all we gift showered upon him by his friends and neighbors
finding that li sh show little enthusiasm on the subjects she tried tolls him by patriotic appeals of various sorts
very well said missus wilkins resolutely to herself if i can't make no impression on his soul i will on his stomach and see how lave work
we can't afford no nice fiddles now when our men are suffer so
he was not as unmoved as he seemed by the general excitement and had felt sundry manly and pulses to up an and atom when his comrades in the shop discussed the crisis with ireful brandishing of os in ventral pounding of soul leather as if the rebels were under the hammer
to say that the sis rows at once and swallowed the bit cook and but feebly expresses the justice done to the cakes by that long suffering men
can you remember what hes told us and call them poor longs suffering creator's names
now he ain't it's a trainer added an liz

and the inconsistent woman fell upon his button ney breast weeping copiously
his wife said him with the fat of the land regardless of consequences his childrens revolved about him lift tireless curiosity and wonder his neighbors flocked into applaud advise an admire everyone treated him with respects most grateful to his feelings he was an objective interest and with every hour his importance increased so that by night he felt like a commander in chief and bore himself accordingly
then the good sol openly shorted the broken she had born so long and secret and bravely trudged on alone
the women drop their wor to lookin lessen for his visits were few when short and every instant was precious
they knew what it was without a word missus sterling clasped her hands and bowed her head
now let's be brave and enjoy of re minute of it
we will what can i do for your davy asked cresty wonderfully supported by the thought that she was going to

then they stood quite still for a time and in the silence the two hearts talked together in the sweet language no tongue can otter
surely i shall if i give you and myself to the cause and i do it gladly though i knows that my heart has got to ac it never has a yet when my courage fails as it will buy and by and my selfish soul counts the cost of my offering after the excitement is over
david caught the exaltation and gave no further thought to anything but the duty of the hour finding himself stronger and braver for that long look into the illuminated face of the woman he loved
the roses are for they remind me of poor helen and the first tok i did with daid was arranging flowers like these for a dead baby's little coin
but i think few bride stress with a braver happer heart than mine though i do choose this ober wedding gown answered christie smiling again as she took from the half packed trunk her new hospital suit of soft gray woolen stuff
mister powers waiting are you ready love quite ready
you young folks take a wedding trip to the greenhouse while we see how we we can get on without you
david and christie went smiling away together and if they shed any tires over the brief happiness no one saw them but the flowers and they leally kept the secret folded up in their tender hearts
a veryain simple little marriage feast but more love good will and tender wishes adorned the plain tableland is often found it wetting breakfasts and better than any speech her song was let hes broken whisper that she folded her arms round david s empty chair when no one saw her heaven bless and keep them bring him back to us
all watched with quicken birth and proud souls that living wave blue below and bit with a stilly glitter above as it flowed down the street in away to join the sea of dauntless hearts that for mons had rolled up against the south and et back reddened with the blood of men like these
then she saw david and the regiment became one man to her
i couldn not lovely dear so much loved i not on her more
everye elevation of the type man has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always be a society believing in a longs scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings and requiring slavery in some former or other
the distinctions of moral values of either originated in a ruling cast pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled or among the ruled class the slaves and dependence of all sorts
we truthful ones the nobility in ancient greece called themselves
it is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to men and were only derive inly and at a later period applied to actions it is a gross mistake therefore when historians of morals start with questions like why have sympathetic actions been praised
he honors whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equals self glorification
probably a pessimistic suspicion with regarded the entire situation of man will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together with his situation
here is the seat of the origin of the famous and tithes goode and evil power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit being despised
according to slave morality therefore the evil man arouses fear according to master morality it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it while the badman is regarded as the despicable being
everywhere that slave morality gaines the ascendancy language shows a tendency to approximate significations of the word good and stupid
or he will even say for many reasons i can delight in the good opinion of others perhaps because i love and on them and rejoice in all their joys perhaps also because their good opinion indorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhaps because the good opinion of others evening cases were i do not sh it is useful to me or gives promise of usefulness all this however is not vanity
in fact conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order and its cause the blending of the blood of masters and slaves the original noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to themselves into think well of themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but it has at all times an older ampler and more radically en grained propensity opposed to it and in the phenomenon of vanity this older propensity over masters the younger

variations whether they be deviations into the higher finer and rarer or deterioration and monstrosities appear suddenly on the scene in the greatest exuberance and splendor the individual dares to be individual and attach himself
at this turning point of history there manifest themselves side by side and often mixed and entangled together a magnificent manifold virgin forest like up growth and up striving a kind of tropical tempo in the rivalry of growth and an extraordinary decay and self destruction owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoism which strive with one another for son and light and can no longer a sign any limit restraint or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality
nothing but new wise nothing but ne hows no common formulas any longer misunderstanding and disregarding mee with each other decay d ti and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled the genius of the race overflowing from all the corne copies of goodby tenuous ness of spring and autumn full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh still exhausted still unwearied corruption
dangers again present the mothers of morality great danger this time shifted into the individual into the neighbor and friend into the street into their own child into their own heart into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and volitions
what will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have to preach
this is the problem of race
in our very democratic or rather very plebeian age education and culture must be essentially the art of deceiving deceiving with regard to origin with regards to the inherited clem in body and soul
the noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without questions and also without consciousness of harshness constrained or arbitrariness therein but rather is something that may have its basis in the primary law of things if he sought a designation for it he would say it is justice itself
on this account the people of one nation understand one another better than those belonging to different nations even when they us the same language or rather when people have lived long together under similar conditions of climate soil danger requirement toil their originates there from an entity that understands itself namely a nation
the greater the danger the greater is the need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary not to misunderstand one another in danger that is what cannot at all be dispensed within intercourse
also when all loves and friendships one h the experienced that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery has been made that in using the same words one of the two parties has feelings thoughts intuitions wishes or fears different from those of the other
which ever groups of sensations within a soul awakened most readily begin to speak and give the word of command these decide as to the general order of rank of its values and determine ultimately its list of desirable things
a man's estimates of value betray something of the structure of his soul and wherein it sees its conditions of life its intrinsic needes
profound suffering makes noble it separates one of the most refine and forms of disguise his epicurism along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste which take suffering lightly and puts itself on the defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound
the highest instinct for purity places him who is affected with it in the most extraordinary and dangerous isolation as a sein for it is just holiness the highest spiritualization of the instinct in questions
occasionally to the waking call comes to late the chance which his permission to take action when their best youth and strength actions have been used up in sitting still and how many a one just as he sprang up his found with horror that his limbs are benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy
and whoever thou art what is it that now pleases thee

but you mis understand him when you complain about it
there must be a sort of repugnance and me to believe anything definite about myself is there perhaps some enigma therein

i do not know he said hesitatingly perhaps the harpies of flown over my table
to suffocate with his memories to him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul and only seldom finds his tableland and his food prepared the danger will always be great nowadays whoever it is extraordinarily so

it was about moon when captain labor he entered the straggling village or of rather hamlet of towle bon closer which was situated the mt of the proprietor
the houses seemed miserable in the extreme especially to and i accustomed to the smiling neatness of english cottages
occasionally indeed when such a consummation seemed inevitable a watchful old grandam with her close capt d staff and spindle rush like a civil and frenzy out of one of these miserable cells dashed into the middle of the path and snatching up her own charge from among the sun burnt loiterers salute him with a sound cup and transported him back to his dungeon the little white headed varlet screaming all the while from the very talk of his longs are shrilly travel to the growling remonstrances of the enraged matron

the house which seemed to consist of two or three high narrow and steep roofed buildings projecting from each others right angles formed one side of the enclosure
it had been built at a period when castles were no longer necessary and when the scottish architects had not yet acquire the art of designing a domestic presidents
neither did the front indicate absolute security from danger
stables another offices occupied another side of the square
two battlemented walls one of which face the avenue in the other divided the court from the garden completed the enclosure
this work of art was the wonder of the country ten miles round
the court was spacious while paved and perfectly clean there being probably another entrance behind the stables for removing the litter
everything around appeared solitary and what have been silent but for the continue plashing of the fountain and the whole seene still maintained the mastic illusion which the fancy of waverley had conte up

mister mort replied the far from making any claim upon his good opinions his only wish and the soul purpose of his visit was to find out the means of deserving it

they seem very revery ignorant poor things said another and reply
the people must way outside for there is no room for them in the palace
so they followed her through the lowe archway and in a room beyond very simply furnished sat young girl engaged and darning a pair of pink stockings
she was a beautiful girl of about seventeen years of age not fat like all the rest of the pinkies but slender and well formed according to our own ideas of beauty
her complexion was not a decided pink but a so off rosy t not much deeper than that of trot skin
what is it quarrel she asked the woman
the queen dazed upon our friends with evident interest
she smiled a little sadly at trot seemed to her prove of button bright's opened frank face and was quite surprised because cap'n bill was so much bigger than her own people

therefore i am a mere agent to directed the laws which are the will of the people and i'm only a publick servant obliged constantly to guard the welfare of my subjects
in that case said button bright your entitle to the best there is to pay for your trouble

we do not hate you as you say the blueskins do nora we's savage or cool but we do not want you hear and i'm really puzzled what to do with you
i'll look in the great book first
the savage philosopher the dual mind
the original attitude of the american indian toward the eternal the great mystery that surrounds and embraces us was his simple as it was exalted
it was silent because all speech is of necessity feeble and imperfect therefore the souls of my ancestors ascend to god and wordless adoration

that solitary communion with the unseen which was the highest expression of our religious life is partly described in the word dam day literally mysterious feeling which has been variously translated fasting and dreaming

knowing the god sets no value upon material things he took within no offerings are sacrifices other than symbolic objects such as paints and tobacco
at the solemn hour of suns or suns he took up his position overlooking the glory's of earth and facing the great mystery and there he remained naked erects silent and motionless exposed to the elements and forces of his army for a night and a day to two days and knights but rarely longer
when he returned to the camp he must remained a distance until he had again entered the vapour bath and prepared himself for intercourse with his fellows
it was not then holly from ignorance or in providence that he failed to establish permanent towns and to develop a material civilization
to the untutored sage the concentration of population was the prolific mother of all evils moral no less than physical

it is well known that the american anian had somehow developed a coat power and although in the latter days there had been many impostors and allowing for the vanity and weakness of human nature he is fair to assume that there must have been some evening the old days yet there are well attested instances of remarkable prophecies and other mystic practice
no doubt many predictions have been covered to suit a new age and unquestionably false profits takers and cons had become the pest of the tribes during a transition period
this was carried out to the letter
this was only one of his remarkable prophesies
another famous medicine man was morn on the rum river about one hundred and fifty years ago and lived to be over a sentry old
at the age of about seventy five years he saved his band from utter destruction into hands of their ancestral enemies by suddenly giving warning received in a dream of the approach of a large war party
five years later he repeated the service and again saved his people from awful slaughter

i'd been feeling mean all the mornings if i had stolen in a sheep but when they wed to charge was given i got happy
officers could dot curb the men to keeping line
on monday the tide was reverse
but as i said before reader a private soldier as but an automaton and those nothing of what is going on among the generals and i am only giving the chronicles of little things and events that came under my own observation as i saw them then and remember them now
should you desire to find out more about the battle i refer you to history
about the time he pulled trier a straight ball from some directions struck him in side and he fell off dead and his horse becoming frightened galloped off dragging him through the confederate lines
a monday morning i too captured me mule
it was wise and his own conceit
i freely thought it would be pleasant to split the difference with that mule and i would gladly have done so if i couldn have gotten one half of his no
mule did not desire to cross while i was trying to persuade him with a big stick a rock in his ear and twister on his nose
so he got a large two inch rope tied one and round the mule's neck on the other to the case and ordered the driver a whip up
the rope however was stronger than the mules no and he was finally prevailed upon by the strength of the rope to cross the creek
im i taking the rope offs himself and seemed to say you think that you are mighty smart folks but you are a little too smart

i made a quick glance o my shoulder and grabbed by gone
he divined my motive and fired the ball mis its aim
i think we must have killed a good many in the old field because we were firing all the time at the solid line as they advanced upon us
we kept falling back and firing all day and were relieved by another rug about dark we rejoined our regiment
line of battle was formed on the north bank of stones river on the yankee side
bad generalship i fought it was christmas
the private could but he was how generall you see
i called lieutenant colonel fry son's attention to the yanks and he remarked well i don't know whether they are you anker not but if they are they will come it out of their mighty quick
the yank marched over the hill out of sight
we were ordered forward to the attack
we were right upon the yankee line on the walkers and turn pipe
we were not twenty yards off from the anties and they were pouring a hot shot and shells rid into o ranks and every man was yelling at the top of his voice seems fire you are firing on your own man seize firing you are firing on your own men
oakley color bearer of the fourth ten sey regiment ran right up in the midst of the ech line with his colors begging his men to follow
the leaden hail storms swept them off the field they fell back and reformed
we were at that time at least a hundreds yards in advance of the brigade cheat him all the time calling upon the men to come on
i sawn felt that he was not fighting for glory but that he was fighting for his country because he loved that country and he was willing to give his life for his country and the success of our cause
i thought it had been torn for my shoulder
as i went back to the fields hospital i overtook another man walking along
i looked at out it pretty close and i said great god
he was walking along and all at once he dropped down and died without a struggle or a groan
but it could not bear the thought a wearing dead men's shoes
he was stone dead but i dropped at foot quick
before we arrived at the house we saw a body of yankees approaching and as we started to run back they fired upon us
our pickets run in and reported the night attack
advance into tense
yan says what are you do in johnny
we passed around landa crossed the chat hooch and traveled back over the same root on which we had made the arduous campaign undertow johnson
of side of these occasional reminders we could seen no evidence of the desolation of the track of an invading army
we saw the united states flag flying from the ramparts and thought the yank would probably be a asleep or catching l sir may be engaged in the game of seventh up
he walked up and says helle boys what is it boss
a jack al wass knacker
they persuaded eloquently
a man on the well
the voice appeared to be overhead
right before me i saw the longing dry grass all bending toward the common center and i knew that it was an old well and that my comrade had fallen in it
but how to get him out was the unsolved problem
the poor fellow state in that well all night
we looked all around and thought that the coast was clear
i don't thinke his gun was lowed though because we did not hear the ball whistle
we walked over this floating bridge and soon found ourselves on the tens side of ten sey river
we had be for supper that night
how every pulsed beat and leap and how everye heart that throb with e motions of joy which seemed nearly akin heavens when we received the glad intelligence of our onward march towards the land of promise and of our loved ones
we were inn to privations and hardships had been upon every march in every battle and every sterns and every advance and every retreat in every victory and every defeat
he wanted to go by home and tell his wife and children good by and to get his clothes it was no go
but afterwhile jim says gentleman i gaining beam
you see jim know the law
those old soldiers had long long ago forgotten about that old law the long gone passed but jimmu it up in his memory low these many years and he thought it would servant now it had no doubt frequently done in the past
the third day was reported that the yankees had taken position on the murphy's borough pike
a regiment was sent to the attack it was jim's regiment
he hadn seen anything to shoot out but he blazed away he loaded and fired the second time when they were ordered to retreat
but is laughter a synonym of joy
such perfect completeness is not in nature
had gwynplaine when a child been so worthy of attention that his face had been subjected too transmutation why not
according to all appearance industrious manipulates of children had worked upon his face
it seemed evident that a mysterious and probably a colt science which was too surgery what alchemy was to chemistry had chiseled his flesh evidently at a very tender age and manufactured his countenance with premeditation
gwynplaine was a mountain bank
he showed himself on the platform
it was gwen plains lap which created the laughter of others yet he did' not lu himself
the outside did not depend on the interior
no one could escape from this rice
all his emotions whatever they might have been augmented his strange base of joy are to speak more correctly aggravated it
and ever lasting laugh
the minions believed the absolute occasionally gives way and it god himself sometimes abdicates for a time so also of the will
the whole of existence resembles a letter modified in the postscript
with this exception when plains lu was ever lasting
the joyous convulsion of laughter was as at tribute paid they submitted to it gladly but almost mechanically
besides we must remember that they had in those times means of putting patience to sleep and of suppressing all suffering only then it was called magick while now it is called anesthesia
besides this face those who had brought him up had given him the resources of a chimes and an athlete
when plain had yellow hair
his hair having probably been died with some corrosive preparation had left it woolly and rough to the touch
its yellow bristles rather amain than a head of hair covered in concealed a lofty brow evidently made to contain thought
the operation whatever it had been which had deprived his features of harmony and put all their flesh into disorder had had no effect on the bony structure of his head
what true things are told and stories
in gwynplaines evil thoughts never ripened and he had therefore no remorse
what was this nothing
from sixteen eighty to seventeen no four a great change had taken place
the wheels were all of the same size and high as wagon wheels
this green colour had succeeded in drawing attention to the carriage which was known in all the fair grounds as the green box
on the roof from a two painted green like the rest smoke arose
the astonishment with which the villagers regarded this machine was overwhelming
this was the old establishment of uses its proportions augmented by success and improved from a wretched booth into with theater
unknown people had worked upon his face he on the other hand had worked on his mind and behind this well executed mask he had placed all that he could have thought
the effective his appearance had been surprising
some believed it to be natural others declared it to be artificial and as conjecture was added to reality everywhere at everye cross rud on the journey in all the grounds of fairs and fates the crowd ran after gwynplaine
the curiosity of one place exhausted they passed on to another
this fortune had allowed ursus who was the administrator of gwynplaine success to have the chariot of his dreams constructed that is to say a caravan large of to cary theater and to so science and art in the highways
for these red feebly and venus that we may conformed to english pronunciation
p be cooked venus crabb the temple
ursus and h mo to of charge of each other
this hut in a corner at the back to the right of the door served as bed chamber and dressing room to uses in gwynplaine
the caravan was divided into three compartments partition from each others
aloft under the arch of the roof contained the scenes and opening a trap door lamps appeared producing wonders of light
ursus was the poet of these magical representations he wrote the pieces
then i look perhaps like what i am
this opening looked for all the worlds like a mouth of hill in the words of the i tenant puritan preachers who turned away from it with horror
uses was in everything in the peace in the company in the kitchen in the orchestra
it was established it southwick
the dome of saint palls was a delight to ursus
saint paul is a sin only with extenuating circumstances
he entered heaven only by the artist's door
it might have been ordered for the green box
it was at the eater ready made
against this s wall was placed the green box which they were able to draw into the yards owing to the height of the gate
the placard when plain the laughing man taken from its nail in the green box was hung up close to the sign of the inn
by the sight of the door was constructed off hand by means of an empty barrel a box for the money taker who was sometimes feebly and sometimes spinous
we are in london said ursus we must be prepared for the gentry
they began their performances
with that exception their are success became so great that no m to bank memory could recall its parallel
all south work ran in crowds to admired the laughing man
the marry andrews and mountebanks of tubs field where aghast gwynplaine
gwynplaine eight up their publick
besides the small fry the swallows of swords and the grim makers real performances took place on the green
even this comedian of jaws and claws was eclipsed in success
that success was prodigious still if remained local
it took a hundreds and thirty years for the name of shakes bur to penetrate from england inter france
the glory of gwynplaine had not passed london bridge
these were remarkable talents
besides this he harangued like sis ro as we have just seen sold drugs attended sickness and even heeled the sick
ursus was satisfied with the applause of southwick but by no means astonished
at every performance the yard of the inn transformed into a pit was filled with a ragged and enthusiastic audience
the emptying of tankards did not decrease their success
this con sor was suddenly fascinated and had adopted the laughing man
he did not come everye evening but when he came he led the public applause grew into acclamation success rose not to the roof for there was none but to the clouds for there were plenty of them
which clouds seeing that there was no roof sometimes wept over the master piece of ursus
his enthusiasm caused uses to remark this man and gwynplaine to observe him
they had a great friend in this unknown visitor
one evening ursus was in the side scene which was the kitchen door of the green box seeing master nicholas standing by him showed him this man ino crowd and asked him
what a pity that he should not be a lord
he would make a famous scoundrel
at that hour there was no one in the fair ground except perhaps some reeling drunkard making staggering shadows and dark corners
on the second of the months at t in the morning our precious cargo luggage was taken on board the goods ship vulgar
but in the cause of science men are expected to suffer
well and have we affair win
my uncle was delighted for myself moody and dissatisfied i appeared almost to expected glimpse of the ghost of hamlet
but no goes anything else appeared upon the ancient walls
the fact is the castle as much later than the time of the hope prince of denmark
no mister hard wigs said the captain no fear that
at all events we shall get there some day
on the eleventh day we sighted cape portland over which towered mount males yoke which the weather being clear we made out very readily
the vagary kept off the coast sparing to the westward
on all sides were to be seen whole schools of wales and sharks
nearly the whole population of the town was on foot to see us land
the fact was that scarcely any one of them but expected some goods by the periodical vessel
then without further remark he put his finger to his lips frowned darkly and descended into the small boat which awaited us
he was however but a civil servant a magistrate the governor of the island baron tramp
the professor knew whom he had a deal with
this modest scholar spoke no language safe icelandic and latin
when therefore he addressed himself to me in the language of horace we at once came understand one another
now harry said my uncle rubbing his hands i goes well the worst difficulties now over
in the meantime there is not hour to lose
very likely a m find their some manuscripts from the hand of suns
i shall be glad to consult them
they were now however absent duty
though not very large it appeared not likely to be filled for centuries
i have not the slightest doubt that in high winds its red tiles were blown out to the great anny of the pastor and congregation
thanks to the heat of these residences grass grows in the roof which grasses carefully cut for hay
i saw but few inhabit and stirring my excursion but i met a crowd on the beach drying salting and loading codfish the principal article of exportation
the men appeared robust but heavy fair haired like germans but of pensive mean exiles of a higher scale in the latter of humanity than eskimos but i thought much more unhappy since with superior perceptions they are compelled to live within the limits of the poor circle
i began to enjoy the exhilarating delight of traveling a life of desire gratification and liberty
hans are extraordinary guide went first walking with a steady rapid unvarying step
our two horses with the luggage follen of their own accord without requiring whip or spur
geographers have divided into four parts and we had across the south west quarter which in vary is called sued vest furder
we took our way through poor and sparse meadows which made a desperate effort every year to show a little green
they very rarely succeeded a good show yellow
i could not help smiling to see look so bigg on his little horse his long legs now and then touching the ground made him look like a six footed cent
snow tempest impracticable roads rocks icebergs nothing stops him
we may do so was my reply but what about our worthy guide
i should have a violent attack of the cramp if i were not to have some sort of exercise
my arms are right but my leger getting a little stiff
here and there could be seen an isolated farm some solitary bur or icons built of wood earths fragance of lava looking like beggars in the highway of life
a few straight housing sheep were only seen occasionally
little did expect however the spectacle which awaited ass when we reached the peninsula of snaffles where a glomeris of natures ruins form a kind of terrible chaos
it consists simply of a few houses not what in england or germany we should call a hamlet
i took occasion to consult the map to see or guard was to be found
these sacred edifices are however veryain much like these people who do without watches and never miss them
to writer result water upon the back of little horse seemed to me absurd
in any case i shall trust rather to my own intelligence than theirs
but my uncle wasn't no humour to wait
at length the sturdy little pony spreading out his legs in a stiff and ludicrous attitude got from under the professor's legs and left him standing with both feet on a separate stone like the colossus of roads
he says tied replied my uncle tram lading the danish word for my information
i thoroughly understood and appreciated the necessity for waiting before crossing the fard for that moment when the sea at its highest poin is in a state of slack water
accustomed as i had been to the steam fairy boats of the helb i found the longs of the boatman but sorry means of locomotion
but this power of discernment was denied them and only in after years with the love ones of their own firesides close about them was the whole picture revealed

three days later mine talk became news him's wife at the hudson they post
from that hour dated one the most sanguinary feuds in the history of the great trading company a few which as we shall see was destined to live evening unto the second generation
meanwhile two children came to bless the happy union of new some and his lovely indian wife
the other was a girl three years younger and new some insisted that she be called minute talk
curiously enough the blood of lobby ran almost pure to his indian four fathers while min a talk as she became oder developed less of the wild beauty of her mothers and more of the softer loveliness of the white race her wealth of soft jet black hair and her great dark eyes contrasting with a lighter skin of her father's blood
rabby on the other hand was an indian in appearance from his moccasins to the crown of his head swore the siny and agile as a lens and with every instinct in him crying for the life of the wild
one of n son's chief pleasures in life had been the educating of his wooden bride and it was the ambition of both that the little men talk in her brother be reared in the ways of white children
consequently both mothers and father began their education at the post they were sent to the factor school and two winters were passed in poor arthur that they might have the advantage of thoroughly equip schools
the children proved themselves unusually bright pupils and by the time wobbly was sixteen and min talk twelve one would not have known from their manner speech that indian blood ran in their veins
it was at about this time in their lives that the wounds became especially daring in their
at last so daring d he become that the provincial government placed a price upon his head and upon those of a number of his most notorious followers
but each week added to his lowliness and his longings from m talking and his forests
necessity had become his grim master and the following week he was doing to work
a thousand plans were made a thousand adventures pictured and the mother with smile and laugh and plan with them
but in time the end of it all came and wile be went back to of the princess mother to min talk and to his forests
they there were tears in the boys eyes when they parted and the mother cried for the indian boy who was returning to his people

c only unit tell that regarded the white flag with feelings in which triumphant sadness were mingled strangely
but the motions of harry and his comrades were for the moment those of victory only
boats put up both from the four e the shore
the smoke itself which he had formed a vast cloud over the harbour forts and city was now drifting out to see leaving all things at sharply in the dazzling sunlight of u southern springing day
that white flag and those boats going out mean that sumter his hours
but the negotiations were soon completed
all the amenities were preserved between the capture garrison and their captors
the great state of virginia mother of presidents went out of the union at last and north carolina tense and arkansaw followed her the maryland kentucky missouri still hung in the balance
lincoln had called for volunteers to put down a rebellion but harry heard everywhere in charleston that the confederacy was now securer
the progress of president davis to the new capital set in the veryain face of the foe was to be one huge triumph of faith and loyalty
there was not a single note of gloom

colonel ken rites wisely
we need kentucky and i understand that a veryain little more may bringing the state to us go with your father i understand that you have been a brave young soldier here and may you do as well up there
harry feeling pride but not showing it saluted and left the room going at once to madame do les where he had left his baggage
he intended to leave ely in the morning but first he saw his friends and told them good bye
hy gave his farewells with deep and genuine regret
whether their manner was grave or frivolous he knew that these work good friends of his and he sincerely hope that he would meet them again
it was a different harry who start at home laid in april
for months had made great changes he bore himself more like a man his manner was much more considered and grave
he had seen great things and he had done his share of them
he gazed upon a world full of responsibilities and perils
but he looked back at charleston the gay the vault on the beautiful with real affection
it was almost buried now and flowers and foliage
he was going home after victory
he soon left charles th out of sight
he felt the difference as soon as he reached the hills of his native state
people were cooler here and they were more prone to look at the two sides of a questions
the air two was unlike that of self carolina there was a sharper tang to it
it whipped his blooded as it blew down from the slopes and crests
it was afternoon when he reached the little station of winton and left the train a tall sturdy boy the superior of many a man in size strength in agility
there were never before such times in old conte king
bill scali and as gang them mountains were up
he did not see the last as boast but merely ass an assurance to the liveryman who he saw was anxious on his account
if you've got pistols just you think once before you shoot said collins
harry thanked him through his saddle bags across the horse a powerful bay and giving a final wave of his hand to the sympathetic liveryman rode away
this was not the fashion of a year ago when they exchanged a friendly word or two but harry knew its cause now nobody could trust anybody else
but he saw nothing the moved there no signal lights twinkled
one winter evening as soon as his work was over for the day joseph locked the door of his smithy washed himself well put on clean clothes and taking his violin set out for testbridge marry was expecting him to tea
it was the afternoon of a holiday and she had closed early
was there ever a happier man than joseph that night as he strode along the footpaths
he pressed his violin case to his heart as if it were a living thing that could know that he loved it
earth was gone in heavens was all
blest him i hear now my god and blessed shall i be there then
when he reached the suburbs the light of homes was shining through curtains of all colours
just then he was a no mood to think of the sorrows
the nettle in the dark said josephs
he was in a moode for music was he not
he laid down his violin and seated himself where marry told him in her father's armed chair by the fire
letty finding yourself not quite equal to the emergency came in her turn to call marry she went as quietly as if she were leaving a tiresome visitor
the music was broken and josephs left alone with the dum instruments
but in his hands solitude and a violin were sure to marry a music
they sat down and listened in silence
her heart seemed to swell up into her throat and it was all she could do to keep from weeping
a little longer and she was compelled to yielded and the silent tears flowed freely
letty too was overcome more than ever she had been by music
let but a mooded be strong enough and the soul clothing itself in that moode as with a garment can walk abroad and haunt the world
it cried loud that eternity was veryain longed and like a great palace without a quiet room
nor was this exactly the shape the thing took to the consciousness of the musician
i love thee i love the cried the violin and the worship was entreaty that knew not itself
hast thou yet to learned that the love of the human is love is divine is but a lower form of the part of a love of gods
when thou lovest man or woman or childe or even dog aright then wilt thou no longer needed that i telled thee how god and his christ would not be content with each other alone in the glories evening of the eternal original love because they could create more love
he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how shall re love god whom he have not seen
a sobs like a bird knew borne burst from mary's bosom
that enchantment had possessed him the serving as it were the throne of his life and displacing it when it ceased he was not his own master
he started to conscious confusion only neither knowing where he was nor what he did
how it happened he never could tell but he brought down as violin with a crash against the piano that then somehow stumbled and all but fell
in the active recovering himself he heard the neck of his instrument part from the body with a tearing discordant cry like the sound of the ruin of a living world
his violin was broken but his being was made whole
his treasure taken type of hisself and a woman given him instead
ms just like him he murmured
you'll all be over if you don't have a care
looks like a pump of bushes down there but i ain't sure can you make it out

lige leaning over the brink was able to fallow the boy's movements by the aid of the thin arch of light made by the torch in tens hand
that from the cautious movements of the light far below them the guide understood that the lad was at work carrying out his part of the tasks of rescue to the best of his ability

still the rose tree stood out that there must be some great advantages in a gardener's care for she could not pretend to be ignorant of her own superiority to all her wild relations and the woods
then the wind took another frolic round the garden and made up to the large white lily int whose refined ear he whispered a doub as to the necessity or advantage of her thick powerful stem being propped up against a stoopid ugly stick
he really grieved to see it
did that lovely creature supposed that nature who had done so much for her that the fame of her beauty extended throughout the world had yet left her so weak and feeble but she could not support herself in the position most calculated to give her ease and pleasure
indeed not a flower escaped his mischief suggestions
echoed the flowers tremulously as with a sort of fearful pleasure they awaited his approach
making a sort of eddying circuit round the garden he knocked over the cum vous pole tore the strips from the stick that held up the white lily loos all the carnation flowers from their fastenings broke the rose tree down and leveled the sweet peas to the grounds
meanwhile how fared it with the flowers
oh that she were once more climbing up the friendly fur pole
the honeysuckle escaped no better and the carnation was ready to die a vexation at finding that her coveted freedom had leveled her to the dirt
before the day closed the gardener came whistling from his farm work to look over his pretty charges
but for the sight that awaited him he was not prepared at all
weeds meanwhile springing up and a dreary confusion reigned in the once orderly and brilliant little garden
the mistress had returned and the young lady was with her and hurried at once to her favorite garden
in this positions she remained until a gentle hand was laid upon her shoulder
im not thinking about the garden mamma replied the young girl without lifting up her face we can plant new flowers and tie up even some of these afresh
in those very early times there was a man named deucalion and he was the son of prometheus
after jupiter had bound prometheus on mount caucasus and had sent diseases in cares u the world men became very veryain wicked

but men kept on fighting and robbing even while the rain was pouring down and the sea was coming up over the land
no one but to cleon the son of prometheus was ready for such a storm
the days coming said prometheus when jupiter will send a flood the destroy mankind from the earths
but to clean and pera were veryain sade for they knew that they were the only persons who were left alive and all the land

when at last they reached the plain they found themselves at the head of a noble company of human beings all eager deserve them
when at last the queen gave birth to a daughter the king was so overjoyed that he gave a great christening feast the like of which had never before ben known
one of the young fairies overhearing her and fancying she might works some mischief to the little baby w and hin herself behind the hangings in the hall so as to be able to have the last word and undo any harmed the olde fairy might wish to work
the turn of the old fairy had now come and she declared while her head shook with malice that the princess should pierce her hand with a spindle and die of the wound
it is true i cannot entirely undo what my elder has done
now fifteen years after the princess was borne she was with the king and queen at one of their castles and as she was running about by herself she came to a little chamber at the top of a tower and there sad and honest old woman's spinning but she had never heard of the kings ed it
she had no sooner taken up the spindle then being hasty and careless she pierced her hand with the point of it and fainted away
he knew that she would not awake for a hundreds years
one said it was an enchanted castle another that witches this there but most believe that it was occupied by great ogre which carried thither all the children he could catch and ae them up one at a time for nobody could get at him through the wood
the young prince at these words fell himself on fire
scarce may had he come to the wood when all the trees and thorns which had made such an impenetrable thicket opened on one side in the other to offer in the path
he entered a large four cord and stood still with amazement and all
but the faces of the men were rosy and the goblets by them had a few drops of wine left
he entered the guard room there the guards stood drawn up in mine with carbines at their shoulders but they were sounded asleep
he passed through one apartment after another where were ladies and gentleman asleep in their chairs are standing
i have waited long for you
they talked for four hours and it not then said half that was in their heads to say
meanwhile all the rest of the people in the castle had been awakened at the same moment as the princess and they were now extremely hungry
but lady and waiting became very impatient and at length announced to the princess that they all waited for her
then the prince took the princess by the hand she was dressed in great splendor but he didn not hint that she looked as he had seen pictures of his great grand mother look he thought her all the more charming for that
the violins and ho boys played old but excellent pieces of music and after supper to lose no time the grand almoner married the royal lovers and the chapel of the castle
he turned to show them the castle but behold
when she said good night to be and went to her chamber over that were the loved parent and friend would fall asleep no more she felt as if she went walking along to her tomb
at the time mary had noted nothing of these things now she saw them all as for the first time in minute detail while slowly she went up the stair and threw the narrowed ways and he the same wind that raved alike about the new grave in the old house into which latter for all the bil s bank against the walls it found many a chink of entrance
when she opened the door of it the bright fire which bey undesired had kindled there startled her the room looked unnatural uncanny because it was cheerful
she stood for a moment on the hearths and in sad dreamy mooded listened to the howling swoops of the wind making the house quiver and shake
this was her dream as nearly as she could recall it when she came to herself after waking from it with a cry
she was when of a large company at a house where she had never been before a beautiful house with a large garden behind
it was a summer night and the guests were wandering in and out at will and threw house and garden amid lovely things of all colours and odors
but she knew nobody and wandered alone in the garden oppressed with something she did not understand
at the end of it she was in a place of tomes
she entered and the servants soft flitted in silent were busy carrying away the vessels of hospitality and restoring order as if already they prepared for another company on the morrow no one heated her
she was lost lost utterly with an eternal loss
she knew nothing of the place had nowhere to go n where she wanted to go had not a thought to tell her what questioned to ask if she met e living soul
but living soul there could be none to meat
she had lost him years and years before and now she saw him he was there and she knew him
he came to her side and she gave him no greeting
i know it and there is no waking
the old time was but a thicker dream and this is truer because more shadowy
her only life was that she was lost
shall i pour out my soul into the ear of a mist of fume from my own brain
thus was she borne away captive of her dead neither willing nor unwilling of life and death equally careless
with that came a paying of intense pain
she herself should have been the plum a lir in a white gown and green scarf coming to him through the long grass under the blossomed bows
her hands should have been full of blue bells and she should have held them up to his face and maidenly defence as he sprang forward to take her in his arms
you see that she knew exactly how at trust is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheaper weekly journals
she had to the full l aloud of her reading in her environment the literary sense
and curiously enough she was hardly curious at all about what he might have to say
she only wished for may and the orchard instead of january and the dingy dusty waiting room the plain faced preoccupied travellers the dim desolate weather
the setting of the scene seemed to her all important
it was bitterly cold but the embankment was more romantic than a railway carriage
he had been late he had offered no excuse no explanation
but here the only thing that occurred to her was to stove and looking one of the shops till he should ask her what she was looking at
the keen wind thrust itself even inside the high collar of her jacket
her hands and feet were aging with cold
she would have shared his sorrow and shown herself half wife path angel from heaven in this dar hour
she said how frightfully called the is
and yesterday had a letter from her and she seems to expects to think and i thought i i to tell you darling
a shock of u believable relief tingle threw her sot that was all what was it compared with her fears
what opinions would he form of the purity of her mind the innocence of her soul if an incident like this failed to shock her deeply
following the tingle of relief came a sharp sickening pinch of jealousy and mortification these inspired her
i don't wonder you were afraid to tell me she began you don't love me you've never locked me i was an idiot to believe you did
those four true words wounded her more than all the rest
couldn't help it then how can i over truste
do you think i'm not sorry now
no ifs only painful for boot of us
i didn't think a decent and could do such things she was pulling on her gloves go home and glow over at all
he stood up suddenly do you mean it
are you really going to throw me over for a thing like this
and he strode down between the marble tables and out by the swinging door it was a veryain good exit
at the corner he remembered that he had gone away without paying for the tea and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy that error
he checked the siam pulse
so he had listed and went to south africa and he never came home covered with metals and glory which was rather his idea to the few simple words of explanation that would have made all straight and repaid her and him for all the past
the last strains of the ill treated ill fated intermezzo had died away and after them had died away also the rumbling of the wheels of the murderer sparrow organ that had so gaily executed that along with the nine other tunes of its report to the admiration of the house made at the window of the house opposite and the crowing delight of the two baby's next door
the young man drew a deep breath of relief and lighted the wax candles in the solid silver candlesticks on his writing tablet for now the late summer dusk was falling in that organ please heavens made fool the measure of the days appointed torture
then there was silence than a sigh and the sound of light moving feet on the gravel
and again he listened with a quiet pleasure
never at any act seem so impossible
there is a seat and the garden at the side of the house again she hesitated
than she turned towards the quarter indicated and disappeared round lor bushes
look here he said this is all nonsense you know you are tired out and there' something wrong what is it
do drinks and then tell me perhaps i can help you
he hardly cut cake impressed it upon her
he had no time to think but he was aware that this was the most exciting adventure that had ever happened to him
only that your poor where that's nothing i'm poor tool she laughed
her little foot tapped the grave impatiently
he told me to stay on at the hotel and i did' and then one night when i was at the theater my maid a horrid french thing we gotten paris packed up all my trunks and took all my money and paid the bill and went
she said again you are kind
well then i went into lodgings that wicked woman about me one street suit and to day they turned me out beau my money was all gone
let me think he said how glad i am let you happen to come this way
i shall lock up all the doors and windows in the house and then i shall give you my latch key and you can let yourself in and stay the m heere there is no one in the house
i will catch the night train and bring my mother of to morrow th we will see what can be done
you see pap soil very rich and at han they expected me to to get a quaint that with dukes and things and she stopped
it wasn't i you said that said the girl smiling but that so anyhow him then she sighed
all the same he added a relevantly you shall have the lug ki
you are kind she said for a third time and reached her hand out to him he did not kiss it then only took it in hiss and felt how small and cold it was then it was taken away
the lady in the guitar certainly passed the night at hill vie villa but when his mother very angry and very frightened came up with him it about noon the house look just as usual and know one was there were the charwoman

let me enter i pray you to pass light under your roof
its surely a terrible storm outside said the merchant's eldest daughter as the wind rattled the tiles of the roof and the rain beat and torrents against the doors and windows
he is old as well as poor she said
if we decide to show mercy to this poor beggar it is not for you to oppose it
but we should not forget our promise to our father cried the youngest daughter
however in spite of all she could say the elder sisters opened the door and admitted the bigger
it is a fearful night to send away a beggar said the eldest sister wh they were eating
while they were talking the bigger had taken the apples which the girls were to eat for desert and had sprinkled a sleeping powder over them
the two eldest at their apples but the youngest could not eat that night she threw the apple away
she did not stir and he knew that the sleeping powder had thoroughly done its work
then she heard him go down the stairway and un both the heavy doors which led into the store
it was the youngest one who deceived me cried the robber chieftain
perhaps we can outward her yet cried another
the merchant's daughter at first did not answer but as he kept on calling to her she finally asked him what it was that he wanted
i've promise you i will do you no harm
you shall not come int my father's house
hast the charm out to me then said the robber
when she returned his hand was sticking through the hol and door
the cries and curses of the robbers filled the air
they tried in vain to break down the great doors
all my worries about you were foolish
he had little enough to break or bite and once when there was a great famine the land he could hardly procure even his daily bad and as he lay thinking in his bed one night he sighed and said to his wife what will become of us
how c you feet our children when we have no more than we can eat ourselves
o you simpleton said she then must all for die of hunger you had better plain the coffins for us
but she left him no peace till he consented saying ah but i shall miss the poor children
and as soon as their parents had gone to sleep he got up put on his coat and unbarring the back door went out
ah father said hands i am looking at my white cat sitting upon the roof of the house and trying to say good bye
but in reality hence was not looking at a cat but every tiny stopped he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path
but her husband felt heavy at heart and thought it were better to share the last cross with the children
early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed and gave them each s lace of bread which was still smaller than the former piece
we are going into the forest to h would and in the evening when were ready we will come in fet you again
cancel thought the roof tasted veryain nice and so he tore off a great peace while gretel broke a large round pain out of the window and sat down quite contentedly
come in and stop with me and no harm shall come to you and so saying she took them both by the hand and led them into her cottage
the old woman behaved very kindly to them but in reality she was a bick at old which who way laid children and built a bread house in order to entice them in but it soon as they were in her power she killed them cooked them and ate them and made a great festival of the day
then she took up a hans with her rough hand and shut him up in a little ka with a latest door and although he screamed loudly it was of no use
gretel began to cry but it was all useless for old which made her do ash mounted
ghoul she cried in a passion get some water quickly b hands fatter lean this morning i will kill cook him
dear good god helps now she prayed
creep said the witch and see if it is hot enough and then we will put in the bread but she intended when gretel got in to shut up the oven and let her bake so that she might eat her as well as hans
see i could even get in myself
and she got up and put her head into the oven
and now as there was nothing to fear they went back to the witch's house where an every corner were caskets full of pearls and precious stones
then they began to run and rushing into the house they fell upon their father's neck
not having heard from captain benny dick for some little time randal thought it desirable in sidney's interests to make inquiries at his club
the sailing mass are announced that he had orders to take the vessel back to her port with no other explanation than that the crews was over
this alternative in the captain's plans terminating the voyage a months earlier than his arrangements had contemplated puzzled randal
randal waited while in london on the chance that benny deck might pay him a visit
he is staying at this hotel to try the air of sidon them and he finds that agrees with him
had her beauty fascinated him
randal wrote to accept the invitation determining to present himself before the appointed hour and to questioned catherine privately without giving her the advantage over him of preparing herself for the interview
after months of separation he received a visit from herbert
he distressed me herbert more than words can say
he drank the wine greedily
whatever reviving effected might otherwise had produced on him it made no change in the threatening gloom of his manner
he put down the empty glass taking no notice of his brother's questions
randal he said you know where sydney
i will do neither the one nor the other
you don't know what it is to be used to seeing a pretty creature always nicely dressed always about the room thinking so much of you and so little of herself and then to be left alone as i am left out in the dark
i'm alone do you hear that alone
i haven courage enough to do it for myself
oh why did i engage that governess
i'm afraid he said
i tried it yesterday it' set my brains on fire i'm feeling that glass i took just now
he paused and put his hand to his fevered head
was his mind wandering into some other train of thought
you can't do it
let me here what is first
i feel for you her hert he said warmly
she shall have your message all that i can do to persuade her shall be done
let me rest a little he pleaded if i'm not in the way
he mentioned the name of one of the olds servants mount mor than who had attached himself to randal after the break up of the family
on the next day but one randal arranged his departure for side him so as to arrive at the hotel and hour before the time appointed for the dinner
the new number of a popular weakly journal had that day been published randal bought it
after reading one or two of the political articles he arrived that the columns specially devoted to fashionable intelligence
rand to looked again at the first words in the paragraph
with his own suspicions steadily contradicting him he arrived at the hotel obstinately believing that the charming widow would prove to be a stranger
missus norman and her little daughter were out driving with a friend and were expected to return in good time for dinner
missus presty was at home she was reported to be in the garden of the hotel
how nice of you to come so soon she began
she added looking at him suspiciously
but you ought to have known that we are only half an hour behind you at sid them in the matter of news
there report his premature my good friend
but if these newspaper people waited to find out whether report is tu false how much gossip would society get in its favorite newspapers
you are to understand that catherine is a widow
sit down said missus presty
you shall hear how my divorce daughter and my poor little grandchild were treated at sandy seal after you left us
he would have seen her pining for the company of other children and would have had no mercy on her
he was introduced to missus norman and to missus norman's little girl and we were all charmed with him
when he and i happen he left together he naturally wondered after having seen the beautiful wife where the lucky husband might be
and the captain of course concluded after having been introduced to kitty that missus norman was a widow
stories have been printed i do assure you where a stories had been printed
be fore i consented to answer the child's inquiries i came to an understanding with her mother
honestly
after that i had her mother's authority for telling kitty that she would never see her father again
she asked directly of her father was dead
that will do missus presty you defences thoroughly worthy of your conducts and all other respects
rand past this over without notice
a very wise decision she remarked
have you any message for captain benny deck
not at the hotel justest now
it was a relief to randal in the present state of catherine's relations towards benedict to returned to london without having seen his friend
good bye dear randal
arrived at the station randal found that he must wait for the train
while he was walking up and down the platform with a mind doubly distressed by anxiety about his brother and anxiety about sidney the train from london came in
what are you doing here he asked
you have been to the hotel he burst out you have seen catherine
we have both seen the same newspaper of course and you have been the first to clear the thing up that's it isn't it
not satisfied with gossiping private the greedy public appetite devours gossiping print and once more it than any one editor can supply
supposing the report had been true
in the meantime after what missus presty had confessed the cruel falsehood which had checked poor kitty's natural inquiries raised and in superb obstacle to a meeting the tween father and child
he had promised to do his best toward persuading catherine to grant sydney and interview
even the chance of successfully confiding her to ben ex protection had lost something of its fair promise since randal's visit to side them
be the results however what they might randal could see but one plain course before him now
considerations of delicacy seemed to forbid taking this liberty even with an intimate friend
what happy or future could await her especially if she justified randal's pasted experience of all that was candid and truthful in her characters then to become his friend's wife
shall i say that she may expected early visit from you when i see her to morrow
he added sidney's addressed in a pos gripped and dispatched his letter that evening
but it might perhaps be excusable to infer that the marriage had not yet been decided on and that the captain's proposals were still waiting for catherine's reply
go do you hear
but i mess than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centered in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry
and the cry issued from his poor if we may thus speak a cry frightful in its silence
devi rushed towards the old man and made him in hale powerful restorative
davie unable to bear the side of this touching emotion turned away and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man
for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and pres
what do mean sir
oh you rave sir exclaimed villefort in vain enduring to escape the net in which he was taken i rave
do you know the assassin asked morrel
ni looked upon moral with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made valentine happy and thus fixed his attention
said morrel slyly yes replied mer
the old man's eyes remained fixed on the door
as well yes
must ilya alone no
but can he understand you yes
gentleman he set in the horse voice give me your word of hana that this horrible secret shall for ever remained buried amongst ourselves the two men drew back
my father has revealed the culprit's name my father thirst for revenge is much as you do h even he conjures you as i do to keep this secrete do you not father
morrel suffered in exclamation of horror and surprised es gape him
the old man made assign in the aff mat of
it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of via whose tears silently rolled on his cheeks
but he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone
ner was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed to the lips
the nearest said the district doctor is a good italian obey who lives next do ort you shall i call on him as a pass
davie said villefort be so kind o see tu as to company the gentleman here is the key of the door so that your can go in an out as you please you will bring the priest with you and will obliged me by introducing him into my child's room do you wish to see him
i only wish to be alone you will excuse me will you not
i am going sir and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine
but with full ravishment the hours of prime singing received they in the midst of leaves that ever bore burden to their rhymes
all waters that on earths most limpid are would seem to have within themselves some mixture compared with that which nothing doth conceal
thou make me remember where and what prosper that moment was when lost her mother her and she herself the springing
i do not think there shone so great light under the lids of venus when transfixed by her own son beyond his usual custom
yee are new comers and because i smile began she p adventure in this place elected to human nature for its nest
some apprehension keeps you marveling but the palm delicacy giveth light which has the power to un cloud you intellects
the goods supreme soule in itself delighting created man good and this goodly place gave him as hans of eternal peace
by his default short while he su turned here by his default to weeping and to toil he changed his innocent laughter and sweet play
this every other savour does trans and notwithstanding sled so far may be thy thirst that i reveal to thee no more
between her steps and mine were not a hundreds when equally the margins gave a turn in such away that to the east i faced
nor even thus our way continued far before the lady wholly turn herself unto me saying brother look and listen
now hal conon must needs poor forth for me and with her quire urania must assist me to put inverse things difficult to think
then back i turned to my face to those high things which moved themselves towards us so sedately they had been distance by new wed brides
and i beheld the flame mats onward go leaving behind themselves the air depicted and they of trailing pennons had the semblance so that it overhead remained distinctly with sevenfold lists all of them of the colors whence the sun's bow is made and deals girdle
these standards to the rearward longer wor th was my sight and as it seemed to me ten paces where the outermost apart
the interval between these four contained a chariot triumphal on two wheels which by a griffin's neck came drawn along
not only rome with no such splendid car air gladdened africanus or augustus but poor to it that of the sun would be
three maidens at the right wheel in a circle came onward dancing one so veryain red that in the fire she hardly had been noticed
the second was as if her flesh and bones had al been fashioned out of emerald the third appeared as snow but newly fallen
in rear of all the group here treated of two old men i beheld unlike in habit but like in gate each dignified and grave
and when the car was opposite to me thunder was heard and all that folk august seemed to have further progress indited
and one of them as if by heaven commissioned singing v spans dii bann shouted three times and all the others after
as sooner on my vision smote the power sublime that had already pierced me through air from my boyhood i had yet come forth
to the left hand i turned with that reliance with which the little child runs to his mother when he has fear or when he is afflicted
to say into virgilius not a draw hum of blood remains of me that does not tremble i know the traces of the ancient flame
dante because virgilius has departed do not weep yet do not weep yet a while for by another's sword thou eats must weep
i saw the lady who awhile appeared veiled underneath the and jal festival directed her eyes to me across the river
look at me well in sooth i theatric
yee keep your watch in the eternal day so that nor night nor sleep can steal from you one step the ages make upon their path
therefore my answer is with greater care that he may hear me whose weeping yonder so that the sin and dor bey of one measure
but by the largest of celestial graces which have such lofty vapours for their rig that near to them our sight approaches not
as soon as ever of my second age i was upon the threshold and changed life himself from me he took and gave to others
so low he fell that all appliances for his salvation were already short saved showing him the people of perdition

whence she to me in those desires of mine which led they to the loving of that good' beyond which there is nothing to aspire to
and what a normans or what vantage is upon the forehead of the others showed that thou should turn thy footsteps unto them
he translated at an early age chiefly between eighteen forty five in eighteen forty nine a great number of poems by the italians contemporary with dante or proceeding him and among other things he made aversion of the whole vena prose and verse
this book in its original form was received with favour and settled the claim of hersey to rank as a poet translator or indeed as a poet in his own right
the life lad of rhythmical translation is this commandment that a good palm shall not be turned into bat one
the only true motive for putt poetry into a fresh language must be to endow a fresh nation as far as possible with one more possessions beauty
poetry not being an exact science lery of rendering is altogether secondary to this chief law
often would he avail himself of any special grace of his own ii and epoch if only his will belong to him often would some caen serve him but for his author structure some structure but for his authors cans often the beautiful turn of a stanza must be weaken to adopt some rin which will tally and he seizes the poet reveling in abundance of language where himself is scilly supplied
and if you have time it would be a great service to translate the analyses of the poem which i omitted
un january twenty fifth wrote many a many thanks for a most essential service most thoroughly performed
my notes which you have taken the trouble a revising are of course quite paltry and useless
it is therefore and on all accounts unnecessary to say much more of the work here than it says for itself
throughout the ven wala there' is a strain like the first falling murmur which reaches the ear in some remote meadow and prepares us to look upon the sea
a word should be said here of the title of dont biography
this has induce some mits of the vat d wavy to explain the title as meaning early life
thereafter this sonnet bread and me desire to write down in verse for other things touching my condition the w things it seemed to me that i had not yet made manifest
which thing being thus their came a day when certain ladies to whom it was well known they haven't been with me a diverse times in my trouble were met together for the pleasure of gentle a company
but when i still speake not one of them who before had been talking with another addressed me by my name saying to what and lovest bow this lady singing that thou can'st not support her presence
and now that it hath pleased heard to an i me this love my master of his great goodness hath placed all may be attitude there where my hope will not fail me
then those ladies began to talk closely together and as i have seen snow fall among the rain so was their talk mingled with size
and i declare that when i speak thereof love sh such perfect sweetness over me that if my courage filed not certainly to him my listeners must be all resigned
whatever her sweet eyes are turned upon spirits of love to issue then sent flame which through their eyes who then may look on them pierced to the hard steep chamber everyone
to her i went along in whose much strength my weakness h made strong
so to the road thou shall be reconciled and find the lady and with the lady love
the second begins here an angel the third here de song i know
the first part as divided ino four
in the third i s what it is i purpose to speaks so as not to be the impeded by faint heartedness
and the fourth repeating to whom i purpose speaking i tell the reason why i speak to them
in the second i tell what is understood of her on earth here my ladies desired
the second part is divided into two for in the first i speak of her is regards the nobleness of her soul relating some of her virtues proceeding from her soul and the second i speak of her as regards the nobleness of her body nearing some of her beauties here love sith concerning her
this second partes divided into two for in the one i speak of the eyes which are the beginning of love in the second i speak of the mouth which is the under love
and at the first it seemed to me that i saw certain faces of women with their hair loosen which caught out to me thou shalt surely die after the witch other terrible and unknown appearances set unto me thou art dead
and so strong was my fancy that i wept again and very truth and said with my true voice oh excellent soul how blessed as he that now look at pon bee
where by other ladies who were about the room be coming aware of my discomfort by reason of the moan that she made who indeed was of my very near kindred led her away from where i was and then set themselves to awaken me thinking that i dreamed and saying sleep a longer and be not dis quieted
when being aroused i opened mine eyes and knew that it had been a deception
in my hue was such that they looked at each other and thought of death saying under their breath most tenderly or let us comfort him then unto me what dream was thine that it hath shaken me so much
and there with all such a bewilder that possessed me that i shut min eyes for pace and in my brain did cease order of thought and every helpful thing
then saw i many broken hinted sights in the uncertain state i stepped into
these wilding fancies than carried me to see my lady dead
the second par begins here i was a thinking the first parties into too
this ladys right name was jone but because of her comeliness or at least it was so imagined she was called of many but he mar va springing and went by that name among them
and in his speech he laughed and laughed again then while it was his pleasure remain i chance to look the way he had drawn near and saw the ladies jon and beatrice approach me this the other following one in a second marvell instantly
the second par begins here saying bow the third here then while it was his pleasure
