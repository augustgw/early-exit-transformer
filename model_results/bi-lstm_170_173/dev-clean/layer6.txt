emerging at euston at half past three o'clock in the afternoon alexander had his lugged sent to the savoy and drove it once to bedford square
she blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before if she ran upstairs
the room was empty when he entered
a coal fire was crackling in the great and the lamps were lit for it was already beginning to grow dark outside
she called his name on the threshold but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it
she merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder
i never deemed it would be you partly
when did you come partly and how did it happen you haven't spoken a word
she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head threshed forward like a catapult in leach

buttle beamed his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth
it's got to be a clean break killer
oh partly what an i to two
you ask me to stay away from you because you want me
i will ask the least imaginable but i must have something
hilda sat on the arm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders
you see loving someone as i love you makes the whole world different
and then you came back not karen very much but it made no difference
she slid to the floor beside him as if she were too tired to sit up any longer

i do not believe in such republics any more than in that of plato or if the things we read of really happened i do not hesitate to affirm that these supposed democracies were composed of very different elements from ours and that they have nothing in common with letter except their name
in aristocracies every man as once so objects which he unceasingly pursues but amongst democratic nations the existence of man is more complex the same mind were almost always embrace several objects at the same time and these objects are frequently wholly foreign to each other as it cannot know them all well the mind is readily satisfied with imperfect notions of each
tato sixteen why the national vanity of the americans is more restless and captures than that the english
the americans in their intercourse with strangers appear impatient the smallest cure and insatiable praise
if i say to an american that the country you lives in is a fine one i you replies there is not fellow in the world
if i applaud the freedom which its inhabitants and joy he answers freedom is a fine thing but few nations are worthy to enjoy it
in aristocratic countries the great possess immense privileges upon which their pride rests without seeking to rely upon the lesser advantages which accrue of him
they therefore entertain a calm sense of their superiority they do not dream of vaunting privileges which everyone perceives at no one contests and these things are not sufficiently new to them to be made topics of conversation
they stand unmoved in their solitary greatness well assure that their see of all the world without any effort show themselves off and at no one will attempt to drive them from that position
when an aristocracy carries on the public affairs its national pride naturally assumes this reserved indifferent and haughty form which is imitated by all the other classes of the nation
these persons then displayed tow each other precisely the same pure jealousies which animate the men of democracies the same eagerness to snatched smallest advantages which are equal contested and the same desire to parade ostentatiously those of which they were in possession

what ban crops in the world we feel when death like some remorseless creditor seizes on all we fondly thought our own the twins
the gool like fever was not to be braved with impunity and balked of its prey
the board not so formidable as she had imagined had inquired into her case and instead of sending her to stoke claypole her husband's buck shire parish as she had dreaded had agreed to pay her rent
margaret met gem will sein several days after his brothers were seriously ill and heard from him the state of things at his home
she stopped with her hand on the latch of the wilson's door to still her beating heart and listened to the hushed quiet within
she opened the door softly there sat missus wilson in the old rocking chair with one sick deathlike boy lying on her knee crying without let or pause but softly gently as fearing to disturb the troubled gasping child while behind her old alice let her fast dropping tears fall down on the dead body of the other twin which she was laying out on board placed on a sort of sofas tea in the corner of the room
over the child which hat breathed the father bent watching anxiously for some ground of hope where hope there was none
is there any chance for the other one thank you
but earnest as the father was in watching the yet living he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the dead and sprang gently up and took his dead sun on his hard couch in his arms with tender strength and carried him upstairs as if afraid of wakening him
wishing him said mary in a tone of in gree
then the mother lifted up her voice and wept
her cries brought her husband down to try with his aching heart to comfort hers
marian alice drew near the fire and stood in quiet sorrow for some time
then alice broke the silence by saying
before christmas time i was as fool as fool could be of going home for good aw you heard how i have wished it at this terrible long time
but he stayed long there and at last his sturdy frame shook with his strong agony
o' jem don't give way so i cannot bear to see you
he did not speak as though fearing to destroy by sound or motion happiness that moment when her soft hands touched thrilled through his frame and her silvery voice was whispering tenderness in his ear
don't dim please don't whispered she again believing that his silence was only another form of grief
mary i almost blow myself when i feel i would not give up this minute when my brothers lie dead and father and mother are in such trouble for all my life's past and gone mary as she tried to release her hand you know what makes me feel so blessed
he remained upstairs until after the early dawn showed mary that she need have no fear of going home through the deserted in quiet streets to trying it a little sleep before work hour
so leaving kind messages to george in jane wilson and hesitating whether she might dare to send a few kind words to gem and deciding that she had better not she stepped out into the bright morning light so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had been
her thoughts ran on jem's manner and words not but what she had known the tale they told for many a day but still she wished he had not put it so plainly
i cannot think what possesses me that i must always be wanting to comfort him when he's downcast and that i must go meddling with him to night when sure enough it was his aunt's place to speak d
i think i cannot go right for i either checked myself till i'm down right cross to him or else i speak just natural and that's too kind and tender by half
but will he thank before it
there was something of kane practical shrewdness about her which contrasted very bewitchingly with the simple foolish unworldly ideas she had picked up from the romances which miss simon's young ladies were in the habit of recommending to each other yes
the old levin infused years ago by her aunt estra for ment it in her little bosom and perhaps all the more for her father's aversion to the rich and the gentle
it was a comfort to her when scolded by mis simmons to think of the day when she would drive up to the door in her own carriage to order her gowns from the hasty temper yet kind dressmaker
but the best of her plans the holiest that which in some measure redeemed the vanity of the rest were those relating to her father her dear father now oppressed with care and always it his heart and gloomy person
they sought about the house most of the day as if it were sunday greasing their boots mending their suspenders plating whip lashes
anyway he would never allow one of his horses to be put to such a stream
i had wanted to get some picture books for yorker and antonia even yok was able to read a little now
she cut squares of cotton cloth and we sewed them together into a book
on the white pages i grouped sunday school cards and advertising cards which i had brought from my old country

i put on my cap and ran out to meet jake
he used to help my father cut christmas trees for me in virginia than he had not forgotten how much i liked them
by the time we had placed the cold fresh smelling little tree in a corner of the sitting room it was already christmas eve
from under the lining he now produced a collection of brilliantly coloured paper figures several inches high and stiff enough to stand alone
i can see them now exactly as they looked working about the table in the lamplight jake with his heavy feature so rudely moulded that his face seemed somehow unfinished otto with his half ear and the savage scar that made his upper lip curl so ferociously under his twisted moustache
grandfather came down wearing the white shirt and his sunday coat
morning prayers were longer than usual
he gave thanks for a food and comfort and prayed for the poor and destitute in great cities where the struggle for life was harder than it was here with us
because he talked so little his words had a peculiar force they were not worn dull from constant use
all afternoon he sat in the dining room
at about four o'clock a visitor appeared mister shimerda wearing his rabbits kin cap in collar and new mittens his wife admitted
he sat still and de passive his head resting against the back of the wooden rocking chair his hands relaxed upon the arms
his face had a look of weariness and pleasure like that of sick people when they feel relief from pain
he made the sign of the cross over me put on his cap and went off in the dark
the week following christmas brought in the thaw and by new years day all the world about us was a broth of gray slush and the guttered slope between the windmill and the barn was running black water
it was the first time missus shimerda had been to our house and she ran about examining our carpets and curtains in furniture all the while commenting upon them to her daughter in an envious complaining tone
your mamma i said angrily wants other people's things
for ambrosch my mamma come here
but you see a body never knows what traits poverty might bring out in em
they began to laugh boisterously when they saw me calling
you've got a birth they present this time jim in no mistake
she was four years older than i to be sure and had seen more of the world but i was a boy and she was a girl and i resented her protecting manner
this change came about from an adventure we had together
one day when i wrote over to the shimerdas i found antonia starting off on foot for russian peter's house to borrow a spade ambrosch needed
there had been another black frost the night before and the air was clear and hetty as wine
it was on one of these gravel beds that i met my adventure
i whirled round and there on one of those dry gravel beds was the bigg of snake i had ever seen
i know im just awful jim i was so scared
i never know you was so brave jim she went on comfortingly
a faint feted smell came from him and a thread of green liquid oozed from his crushed head
look tony that is poison i said
i explained to antonia how this meant that he was twenty four years old that he must have been there when white man first came laughed on from buffalo and indian times
we decided the antonia should ride doe home and i would walk
i followed with a spade over my shoulder dragging my snake
ado folks was the first one we met
you could stand right up and talk to you he gould did he fight hard
i don't winked at me
a snake of his size and fighting trim would be more than the boy could handle
peter told his troubles to mister shimerda he was unable to meet a note which fell d on the first of november had to pay an exorbitant bonus and renewing it and to give a margaux and horses and even his milk cow
peter could give no very clear account of his transactions with cutter
she asked peter to wait a moment and when she came back from the kitchen she brought a bag of sandwiches and doughnuts for us
we lay still and did not talk
the little house on the hillside was so much the color of the night that we could not see it as we came up the draw
they made me think of defeated armies retreating or of ghost who were trying desperately to get in for shelter and then went moaning on
i could not take my eyes off the man in the bed
the sharp smell of spirits went through the room
it seemed to me that he despised him for being so simple and docile
the sick man raged and shook his fist
he seemed to be cursing people would wrong him
quickly it was covered with bright red spots i thought i had never seen any bloods so bright
he lay patiently fighting for breath like a child with croup
antony's father uncovered one of his long bony legs and rubbed it with micky

mister chimera went with him
after the ceremony at the church the party went to a dinner given by the parents of the bride
the first hows were taken up and echoed and with quickening repetitions
a black drove came up over the hill behind the wedding party
something happened to the hind most sledge the driver last control he was probably very drunk the horses left the road the sledge was caught up in a clump of trees and overturned
the shrieks that followed mad everybody sober
the road was clear and white and the groom's three blacks went like the wind

and the wolves probable asked enough enough for all of us
they were within a few miles of their village now

now was mill horse was being almost dragged by the other two
probable knocked to over the side of the sledge and threw the girl after him
peter crouching in the front seat saw nothing

they will one out of their village
wherever they went the story followed them
they worked in chicago de morine fort wain but they were always unfortunate
during the action he went about with his head down and never lifted his eyes
everyone said peter kissed the cow before she was led away by her new owner
the loss of his two friends had a depressing effect upon old mister shimerda
when he was out hunting he used to go into the empty log house and sit there brooding
this cabin was his hermitage until the winter snows penned him in his cave
throughout this century the power of the church was constantly on increase and is visible in many important changes
the ancestors of the present pretender congal surnamed the squint eyed had twice received and cherish the licentious bards when under the ban of tara and his popularity with that still powerful order was one prop of his ambition
it is pretty clear also that the last rally of truism against christianity took place behind his banner on the plain of mira
the poets of succeeding ages have dwelt much in detail on the occurrences of this memorable day
like the two kings of sparta they rowing jointly dividing between them the laborers and cares of state
it was the season when the ancient son god had been accustomed to receive his annual oblations and we can well believe that those whose heart still trembled at the name of bell must have connected the eclipse and the plague with the revolution in the national worship and the overthrow of the ancient gods on that plain of prostration where they had so long received the homage of an entire people
lastly the royal brothers fell themselves victims to the epidemic which tho sadly signalized their rain
the only conflicts that occurred an irish soil with a pictish or an anglo sex and force if we accept those who formed a contention of congal army at mira occurred in the time of thus pitiable fena
as leading to the mention of other interesting events we must set this inroad clearly before the reader
the saxons of kent and the southern kingdoms generally were converted by missionaries from france or rome or native preachers of the first or second christian generation those of northumbria recognizes their apostles saint aden and saint cuthbert two fathers from iona
the kingdom of northumbria as the name implies embrace nearly all the country from the humber to the pictish border
the baron rock about three miles in length was covered with an monastic buildings and it cemetery was already adorned with the tombs of saints and kings
now every missionary that ever went out for iona had taught that to reduce christians to slavery it was wholly inconsistent with a belief in the doctrines of the gospel
while the liberated exiles rejoiced on the plain of meat the tent of the abbot of iona was pitched on the wrath of tara a fact which would seem to indicate that already in little more than a century since the interdict had fallen on it the edifices which made so fin a show in the days of patrick were ruined and uninhabitable
so slow impatient is the process by which christianity ef fuses itself into the social life of a converted people
here the holy prelate of ferns met him and related a vision in which he had been instructed to demand the abolition of the impost
the tribute was at this period enormous fifteen thousand head of cattle annually

mode put the flower into a large earthen weare bowl or deep pan then with a strong metal or wooden spoon hollow out the middle but do not cleared it entirely away from the bottom of the pan as in that case the sponge or eleven as it was formerly termed would stick to it which it ought not to do
next take either a large tablespoonful of burgs which has been rendered solid by mixing it with plenty of cold water and letting it afterwards stand a settle for a day and night or nearly announce of german yeast putt it into a large basin and proceeded d mix it so that it shall be as smooth as cream with three quarter pint of warm milk and water or with water only though even a very little milk will much improve the bread
look at it from time to time when it has been laid for nearly an hour and when the yeast has risen and broken through the flower so that bubbles appear in it you will know that it is ready to be made up into dough
then place the pan on a strong chair or dresser or table of convenient height pour into the sponge the remainder of the warm milken water stir into it as much of the flow as you can with the spoon then wipe it out clean with your fingers and lay it aside

italian melt or great indian millet is cultivated in egypt and nubia where it is called dur and is used as human food as well as for the fermentation of bere
it will grow on poor soils and is extremely productive
it has been introduced into italy where they make a coarse bread from it and it is also employed in pastry and puddings they also use it for feeding horses and domestic fowls
a yellow variety called golden millet is sold in the grocer's shops for making puddings and is very delicate and wholesome

to make dry toast
never use new bread for making any kind of toast as it eats heavy and besides is very extravagant
move it backwards and forwards until the bread as nicely colored then turn it and toast the other side and do not place it so near the fire that it blackens
to make hot buttered toast seventeen twenty six
a loaf of household bread about two days old answers for making toast better than cottage bread the latter not being a good shape and too cresty for the purpose
cut as many nice even slices as may be required rather more than one quarter inch in thickness and toast them before a very bright fire without allowing the bread to blacken which spoils the appearance in flavor of all toast
sawyer recommends that each slice should be cut into pieces as soon as it is buttered and when all were ready that they should be piled lightly on the dish they are intended to be served on
he says that by cutting through four five slices at a time all the butter is squeezed out of the upper ones while the bottom one is swimming in fat liquid
muffins and trumpets should always be served on separate dishes and both toasted and served as expeditiously as possible

mode put the milk and butter into a saucepan and keep shaking it round until the later is melted
when cold they should be put into tin canisters to keep them dried and if intended for the cheese course the sifted sugar should be omitted
the narrative it may be is woven of so humble of texture as to require this advantage and at the same time to render it the more difficult of attainment
in good faith however he is not sufficiently imaginative to flatter himself with the slightest hope of this kind
the author has considered it hardly worth his while therefore relentlessly to impale the story with its moral as with an iron rodd or rather as by sticking a pin through a butterfly thus at once depriving it of life and causing it to stiffen in an ungainly and unnatural attitude
if permitted by the historical connection which those slight was essential to his plan the author would very willingly have avoided anything of this nature
he trust not to be considered as unpardonably offending by laying out of street that and fringes upon nobody's private rites and a brok rating a lot of land which had no visible owner and building a house of materials fal and use for constructing castles in the air
the enclosure had formerly been very extensive but was now contracted within small compass and hemmed about partly by high wooden fences and partly by the outbuildings of houses that stood on another street
the white double rosebush had evidently been propped up anew against the house since the commencement of the season and the parry and three damson trees which except a row of current bushes constituted the only varieties of fruit four marks of the recent amputation of several superfluous or defective limbs

phoebe wondered whose care and toil it could have been that had planned to these vegetables and kept the soil so clean and orderly
these too strange to say had thought it worth their while to come hither possibly from the range of hives beside some farmhouse miles away
this was a fountain set round with the rim of old mossy stones and paved in its bed with what appeared to be a sort of mosaic work of variously covered pebbles
it now contained only cham de clare his two wives and a solitary chicken
it was evident that the race had degenerated like many a noble race besides in consequence of two stripped a watchfulness to keep it pure
these feathered people had existed too long in a distinct variety a fact of which the present representatives judging by the lugubrious deportment seemed to be aware
they kept themselves alive unquestionably and laid now and then an egg and hatched to chicken not for any pleasure of their own but that the world might not absolutely lose what had once been so admirable a breed of fowls
the distinguishing mark of the hens was a crest of lamentably scanty growth and these later days but so oddly and wickedly analogous to heaps it the turban that phoebe to the poignant distress of her conscience but inevitably was led to fancy a general resemblance betwixt these flow and by pets and her respectable relative
the chicken crept through the pails of the coup and ran with some show of liveliness to her feet while chant declare in the ladies of his household regarded her with queer side long glances and then croaked one to another as if communicating their sage opinions of her characters
so wise as well as antique was their aspect as to give color to the idea not merely that they were the descendants of a time honoured grace but that they had existed and their individual capacity ever since the house of the seven gables was founded and were somehow mixed up with its destiny
he held a ho in his hand and while phoebe was gone in quest of the crumbs had begun to busy himself withdrawing up fresh birth about the roots the toledo
they have known me much longer but never honour me with any familiarity though hardly a day passes without my bringing them food
this heaps i suppose will inter weave the fact with her other traditions and set it down that the fowls know you to the a pension
ah but these hens answered the young man these hens of aristocratic lineage would scorned to understand the vulgar language of a bon yor fowl
i prefer to think and so would miss heaps that they recognize the family tone for you are a pinsion
my name is fee pension said the girl with a manner of some reserve for she was aware that her new acquaintance could be no other than that the gar typist of whose lawless propensities the old maid had given her a disagreeable idea
i turned up the earth by a way of past time
it is like a bandage over one's eyes to come into it
if you would permit me said the artist looking at pee i should like to try whether that de gar type can bring out disagreeable traits on a perfectly amiable face
most of my likeness is do look unamiable but the very sufficient reason i fancy is because the originals are so
there is a wonderful insight in heavens broad and simple sunshine
while we give it credit only for depicting the merest surface it actually brings out the secret characters with a truth that no painter would ever venture upon even could he detected
yet the original wares to common eyes a very different expression
he exhibited at the grow tight miniature and a morocco case
ey merely glanced at it and gave it back
i can assure you that this is a modern face and one which you will very probably meet
the sun as you see tells quite another story and well not be coated out of it after half a dozen patient attempts on my part
here we have the man slyly subtle hard imperious and withal coldest ice look at that eye
and yet if you could only see that benign smile of the original
well i don't wish to see at any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait
if the original is still in the world i think he might defy the sun to make him look durn and hard
is there nothing wild in the eye continued hol grave so earnestly that embarrassed phoebe as did also the quiet freedom with which he presumed on their so recent acquaintance
it is nonsense said phoebe a little impatiently for us to talk about of picture which you have never seen
since you are a friend of my cousin hes bos you should ask her to show you the picture
so we will be fellow laborers somewhat on the community system
she did not altogether like him
oh rejoined the gar typist because like an old ladys cup of tea it is water bewitched
she was indistinctly aware however that the gaunt figure of the old gentle woman was sitting in one of the straight back chairs a little withdrawn from the window the faint gleam of which showed the blanched paleness of her cheek turned sideways towards the corner
but put it on the table in the corner of the passage
what an instrument is the human voice
how wonderfully responsive to every emotion of the human soul
der words than before but with the same mysterious musick in them
pray go to bed for i'm sure you must need rest
i will sit in the parlour awhile and collect my thoughts
while thus dismissing her the maiden lady stepped forward kissed phoebe and pressed her to her heart which beat against a girl's bosom with a strong high an tumultuous swell
at some uncertain period in the depths of night and as it were to the thin veil of a dream she was conscious of a footstep mounting the stairs heavily but not with force and decision
many's flat as the one floor resident apartments were then being called was in a part of west v beer in street inhabited by families of laborers and clerks men who had come and were still coming with the rush of population pouring in at the rate of fifty thousand a year
to carry the sound of the little bells upon the horse cars as they tinkled in and out of hearing was as pleasing as it was novel
to him the presence or absence of his wife's sister was a matter of indifference
he was of a clean saving disposition and had already paid a number of monthly instalments on two lots far out on the west side
his ambition was some day to build the house on them
she had some slight gift of observation and that sense so rich in every woman intuition
the walls of the rooms were discordantly pap
the floors were covered with matting and the hall laid with a thin ragged carpet
then she walked and sang to it until handsome disturbed in his reading came and took it
one could see that he was very much wrapped up in his offspring
now now he said walking there there and there was a certain swedish accent noticeable in his voice
he seemed to be thinking of something else
many began to explain but her husband took this part of the conversation to himself
you could get home easy to it isn't very far
she asked for many for ink and paper which were upon the mantle in the dining room and when the latter had gone to bed at ten got out drew his' card and wrote him
she wanted to make some reference to their relations upon the train but was too timid
anything was good enough so long as it paid say five dollars a week to begin with
a shap girl was the destiny prefigured for the newcomer
it was under such auspicious circumstances that she started out this morning to look for work
narrow board walks extended out passing here a house and there a store at far intervals eventually ending on the open prairie
it gave an imposing appearance to most of the wholesale houses whose offices were upon the ground floor and in plain view of the street
these vast buildings what were they
he was in a fever state of mind owing to the blight his wife's action threatened to cast upon his entire future
he would have to pay her the money which she would now regularly demand or there would be trouble it did not matter what he did
hurstwood walked the floor mentally arranging the chief points of the situation
he also thought of his managerial position
how would the papers talk about it
many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplated this and his brown moistened
he could arrange that satisfactorily for carry would be glad to wait if necessary
he would see h things turned out to morrow and then he would talk to her they were going to meet as usual
for some reason he felt as if something might come that way and was relieved when all the envelopes had been scanned nothing suspicious noticed
while the danger had not lessened it had not as yet materialized and with him no news was good news
so little did he consider drew that it never once occurred to him to worry about his finding out
he grew restless as he ruminated and then decided that perhaps it was nothing
she had not been able to get away this morning
he would get one to day it would probably be on his desk when he got back he would look for it at once
after a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the medicine car
he went in and examined his letters but there was nothing from carry
fortunately there was nothing from his wife either
at one thirty he went to rectors for lunch and when he returned a messenger was waiting for him
his first impulse was to write but forwards and reply go to the devil
but he compromised by telling the boy that there would be no reply
then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing contemplating the result of his work
what would she do about that the confounded wretch
later however his old discretion asserted itself
something had to be done a climax was near and she would not sit idle
he knew her well enough to know that when she had decided a upon a plan she would follow it up
he arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street
the long drizzle had begun pedestrians had turned up collars and trousers at the bottom
hurstwood almost exclaimed out loud at the insistence and this thing
he put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella
he would have some arrangement of this thing
he began to wish that he had compromised in some way or other that he had sent the money perhaps he could do it up here
he would go in and see anyhow he would have no rowl
by the time he reached his own street he was keenly alive to the difficulties of his situation and wished over and over that some solution would offer itself that he could see his way out
then he rang the bell no answer
he rang again this time harder still no answer
when hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greater quandary than ever
he could hardly realize how would it all come about
no letter had come no word of any kind and yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning
he saw that in the excitement of reason events he had not formulated a plan upon that score
he was getting some big comfort out of a good savour but it was no penn shire for the ill which affected him
it was with great opposition after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial that at last he got a ve lope placed in it the requested amount and slowly sealed it up
then he called harry the boy of all work around the place
you take this to this address he said handing him the envelope and give it to missus hurstwood yes sir said the boy
any answer i guess not
the boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings
he was beaten for to night and he might just as well make the best of it
she would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed
if he only had that letter back he wouldn't send it
full relief he arose and joined in the conversation with a few friends who were drinking
all the time has thoughts would run out to his home and see the scene being barin enacted
in about an hour in three quarters the boy returned
he fancied as he sat at his desk that nothing would be done for a week or two meanwhile he would have time to think
how about that now his pain at her failure to meet or wit him rapidly increased as he devoted himself to the subject
he decided to write her care of the west side post office and ask for an explanation as well as to have her meet him
three o'clock came four five six and no letter
the helpless manager pasted the floor and grimly endured the gloom of defeat
he saw a busy saturday ushered out the sabbath in and nothing done
all day the bar beying closed he rooted alone shut out from home from the excitement of his resort from carry and without the ability to alter his condition one ida
it was the worst sunday he had spent in his life
it seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning
he was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angered of his perfidy
he had loved her earnestly enough but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive
he would go to her and tell her all his family complications
he would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her
he did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to carry but when he got in ogden place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away
he did not go within a block of the house
he trebled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody
he stayed at his desk long after all others had gone and only quitted it when the night's watchmen on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely locked
on ms day he received another polite note from the gregor james and hay it read
dear sir we beg to inform you that we are instructed to wait until to morrow thursday at one o'clock before filing suit against you on behalf of miss julia hurstwood for divorce and alimony
very truly yours et cetera compromise
so here it was spread out clear before him and now he knew what to expects
if he didn't go and see them they would sue him promptly
preface to the second edition
this is a mistake though perfectly natural one
on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last revise to the pinner
then i had much pleasure in reading it but was indeed surprised that the many little points of similarity between the two books in spite of their entire independence to one another
i regret that reviewers have in some cases th inclined to treat the chapters o machines as an attempt to reduce mister darwin's theory to an absurdity
i am surprised however that the book at which such an example of the specious ms use of analogy would seem most naturally leveled should have occurred to no reviewer neither shall i mention the name of the booker though i should fancy that the hint given will suffice
but this had effective which i have little reason to complain for i was allowed almost to call them life long self deceivers to their faces and they said it was quite true but that it did not matter
i must not include without expressing my most sincere thanks to my critics and to the public for the leniency and consideration with which they have treated my adventures
it was written in the upper wegg hat a district of the canary province as it then was a new zealand and appeared at christ church in the press newspaper june thirteenth eighteen sixty three
i also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the musical banks and the trial of a man for being in a consumption
i see for my second preface that i took the book to monsieur's chapman and hall may first eighteen seventy one and on their rejection of it under the advice of one who is attained the highest rink among living writers i let it sleep till i took it to mister trubner early in eighteen seventy two
i attribute its unlooked for success mainly to two early favorable reviews the first in the palm male gazette of april twelfth and the second in the spectator of ar twentieth
there was also another cause
the first edition of iran selden about three weeks i had not taken moulds and as the demand was strong it was set up again immediately
i made a few further very trifling alterations before moulds were taken but since the summer of eighteen seventy two as new additions were from time to time wanted they have been printed from steals then made
i am still fairly well satisfied with those parts of er aw that were repeatedly re written but from those that had only a single writing i would gladly cut out some forty or fifty pages if i could
this however may at thee for the copy right will probably expire in a little over twelve years
if the reader will excuse me i will say nothing of my antecedence nor of the circumstances which led me to leave my native country the narrative would be tedious to him and painful to myself
it will be seen that i did not succeeded in my design and that however much i may have met with that was new in strange i have been unable to reap any pecuniary advantage
no one who is himself honestest will doubt my being so
i reached my destination in one of the last months of eighteen sixty eight but i dare not mention the season lest the reader should gather in which hemisphere i was
sheep in kettle were introduced and bread with extreme rapidity men took up their fifty thousand or one hundred thousand acres of country going inland one behind the others till in a few years there was not an acre between the sea and the front ranges which was not taken up and stations either for sheep or cattle were spotted about an intervals of some twenty or thirty miles over the whole country
i was delighted with the country and the manner of life
i was to see the sheep not necessarily close at hand nor to get them in a single mob but to see enough of them here and there to feel easy that nothing had gone wrong this was no difficult matter for there were not above eight hundred of them and being all breeding use they were pretty quiet
there were good many sheep which i knew as two or three black use and a black lamb or two and several others which had some distinguishing mark whereby i could tell them
it is surprizing now soon the eye becomes accustomed to missing twenty sheep out of two or three hundredth
it was a monotonous life that it was very healthy and one does not much mind anything when one as well
the country was the grandest that can be imagined
so lonely in so solemn with the sad gray clouds above and no sound save a lost lamb leading upon the mountainside as though was little heart were breaking
each must cry louder and wander farther yet may luck be with them both that they may find their own at nightfall
i had no money but if i could only find workable country i might stock it with borrowed capital and consider myself a mad man
there was no one in the whole world who had the smallest idea save those who were themselves on the other side of it if indeed there was anyone at all could i hope to cross it
i would ty the near arrange and see how fy i could go
shortly after passing one of these chapels we came suddenly upon a village would started up out of the mist and i was alarmed lest i should be made an object of curiosity or dislike
my guides however were well known and the natural politeness of the people prevented them from putting me to any inconvenience but they could not help eyeing me nor i them
the streets were narrow and unpaved but very fairly clean
the vine gr outside many of the houses and there were some with sign boards on which was painted a bottle and a glass that made me feel much at home
even on this ledge of human society there was a stunted growth of shop lets which had taken r and vegetating somehow though as in an aram mercantile of the blest
each feature was finished eyelids eyelashes and ears being almost invariably perfect
their expression was divine and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips in great bewilderment i forgot all thoughts of their conversion and feelings that were far more earthly
even in middle age they were still comely and the old great haired women at their cottage doors had a dignity not to say majesty of their own
the men were handsome as the women beautiful
i have always delighted in and reverenced beauty but i felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type a compound of all that is best an egyptian greek and italian
the children were infinite in number and exceedingly mary i need hardly say that they came in for their full share of the prevailing beauty
i expressed by signs my admiration and pleasure to my guides and they were greatly pleased
the country was highly cultivated every ledge being planted with chestnuts walnuts and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering
i saw a few sheep with grounded noses and enormous tiles
in about four hours of walking from the time we started and after passing two or three more villages we came upon a considerable town and my guides made many attempts to make the understand something but i gather no inkling of their meaning except that i need be under no apprehension of danger
suffice it that i found myself taken before the chief magistrate and by his orders was placed in an apartment with two other people who were the first i had seen looking anything but while in handsome
in fact one of them was plainly very much out of health and caged violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it
the other looked pale and ill but he was marvellously self contained and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him
they felt my pulse they looked at my tongue they listened at my chest they felt all my muscles and at the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded and sit of the ino tone quite pleasant as though i were all right
but by am i they came to my watch which i had hidden away in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search
again there was a very old carriage whose wheels in spite of abreast and decay i could see had been designed originally for iron rails
we passed many cases and at last came no one in which there were several clocks of two or three old watches
the design was different but the thing was clearly the same
this hadad some affecting calming him
he began presently to relent and spoke to me in a kinder manner
i imagine there was several kinds of old fashioned christmases but it could hardly be worse than a chop at my chambers or horror of horrors at the club where my cousin lucy's notion of what she calls the festive season
festive yes
the reply was written in a sprawling feminine hand it was a little vague
it appeared that the terms would be five guineas but there was no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover
the whole thing was a trifled
there was nothing set about the sort of accommodation which would be provided nothing about the kind of establishment which was maintained or the table which was kept
now it is a remarkable thing that i have always had an extraordinary predilection for the n image i do not know why
i have never known image and yet from my boyhood upward i have desired to meet one
under such circumstances she was hardly likely to be lively herself but her name was match and it was the accident of her christian name which decided me to go
i had no allusions
i did not expect a princely entertainment
all night it had been blowing and raining
i felt quite lively myself as i mingled with the christmas crowd looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous
i even bought something for madge i mean missus wilson
it was a horrible journey
he was impervious to reason
it is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that i made it warm for the officials however cold i might have been myself
when at last i reached croft in my journey's end he turned out that the station staff consisted of a half witted individual who was station master porter and clerk combined and a hooking lad who did whatever else there was to do
no one had come to meet me the village was about a half a mile and hanger dean that the house for which my steps were bent about four miles by the road how far it was across cloud fields my informant did not mention
there was a trap at the boy and blunderbuss but that required fetching
when the trap did appear it looked to me uncommonly like an open spring cart
in it i was deposited with my luggage
i did not know what he meant
i did not ask i was beyond it
i was chilled to the bone wet tired hungry
i had long been wishing that an old fashioned christmas had been completely extinct before i had thought of adventuring in quest of one
here we be that might be so
there be the door in front of you you go up three steps if you can find em
there's a knocker if none of em heaven twisted it off
there appeared to be no knocker though whether it had been twisted off was more than i could say
no answer though i allowed a more than decent interval
bettering again suggested the driver hard
may be there up to some of their games and wants rousing
the bell reverberated through what seemed like a empty house
presently feet were heard advancing along the passage several pair as it seemed and a light gleaming through the window over the door
a voic inquired whose there
the information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter
there was a rush of retreating feet and expostulating voice then darkness again and silence
who lives here are the people mad
i told the bell again
after a vast amount of unfastening the door was opened and on the threshold there stood a girl with a lighted candle her hand
i mister christopher from london
we've lost the key of the cellar and there's nothing out except water and i don't think you'd care for that
her fathers a most remarkable person to say the least
but it is quite plain to me that all the arrangements for my wedding are going to be made by the snelling
i do not know when it is going to be but it will be either next week or the week after certainly at the earliest possible moment and i shouldn't be at all surprised to learn that all marianne's things have been already bought and perhaps some of them marked
it is most delightful
it might just as well be some one else's wedding so un important is the part which i am set to play in it
for instance look at their behavior in the matter of the ring
the accident and question occurred upon the sunday evening
the girl is fretting but you don't seem to notice it
i guessed positively gasped
that's it on your recount
from a cousin of ours whose in that line
i never saw a people like the snelling for possessing relatives and also its of lines
i was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a prophet out of marian's engagement ring but i handed over the amount
it is from her action in that matter that my suspicion springs
there she owns a cottage or it may be a pigsty for all i know
when she heard of my engagement with marianne she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honey moon in her cottage or pigsty and that i should pay her rent for it
there were no signs of faltering about her flow of language
i found that is a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations
it turned out that she had a little money of her own about a hundred and thirty pounds a year
and of course i had my expectations and she had hers
it was plain that together we should manage most comfortably delightfully in fact
i shall make papa give me five hundred pounds at least
a bird in the hand is worth two in a bush and it will be something to have by us
i know what mamma can afford to give and i will see if she gives it
and i will see that there is no shirking about the boys or about the girls either
i have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present and i shall tell them what they ought to give it won't be my fault if i don't yet it
of course there are some people with whom you can't be perfectly plain but i shall be as plain as i can there's away and a manner of doing that kind of thing
hers has been prodigious
she has a knack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants which is a little short of miraculous
i notice that they are generally persons who have already tendered their offerings
the fact of having given marianna wedding present seems to fill them with a feeling of rancorous acidity which to me is inexplicable
such is the selfishness of human nature
but why am that account they should pity me i alt together fail to understand
we have all been giving maryann presence and i suppose you mister widing have been giving her something too
that was what missus mac pherson said to me only the other day
and what inquired missus mac person has maryann given you her love
some u sniggered
i cannot pretend to explain why except on the supposition that romances dead at least in that circle of society in which the snellen's move
as it is unless i am mistaken some of the rending will be on our side and they know it
pies the cards are out for the wedding
we are going for our honeymoon to italy and the south of france
a second cousin of marian's is in the cooks tours line
he has given us free passes all the way to the end of our journey and all the way back again and coupons for free board and lodging at the hotel it's a wedding present
besides which we can always sell the coupons and railway passes which we don't use
he was young no spear had touched him no poison lurked in his wine
i tell you it is not poison she cried
since his birth he has been guarded so closely that the cleverest poisoners of the east could not reach him
as you will know there are ten men and ten women who so duty is to taste his food and wine and fifty armed warriors guard his chamber as they guard it now
a low confused moan wain from his mouth
the man shrugged his broad shoulders and turned back into the arabesque chamber
this man was clad in a brown camel hair robe and sandals and a green turban was on his head
not until the heavens were in the proper order could they perform this necromancer
with a long stained finger nail he mapped the constellations on the marble child floor
the slant of the moon press aged evil for the king of vena the stars are in turmoil the serpent in the house of the elephant
point of contact inquired the other
all discarded portions of the human bodies still remain part of it attached to it by intangible connections
but at the urgent entreaty of the princess of casa who loved bund chant veni he gave her a lock of his long black hair as a token of remembrance
by which a soul is drawn from its body and across gulfs of echoing space returned the man on the mat
on the dais under the golden dome the king cried out again racked by awful paroxysms
they seek to snap the silver cord that binds me to my dying body
they cluster around me their hands are talent their eyes are red like flame burning in darkness
their finger sere me like fire
i know now what brings me to the pyre
there they strove to break the silver cord of life and thrust my soul into the body of a foul night weird their sorcery summoned up from hell ah
you'll cry and the grip of your fingers brought me back but i am going fast
there was the old imperious note in his failing whisper
you have never disobeyed me oby my last command
send my soul cream to assure
they also found a martian calendar the year had been divided into ten more or less equal months and one of them had been doma
bill chandler zoologist have been going deeper and deeper into the old sea bottom of cyrus
that took the centre of interest away from archology and started a new burst of activity
the civilian specialists in other fields and the space force people who had been holding tape lines and making sketches and snapping cameras were all flying to lower cyrus to find out how much oxygen there was and what kind of life it supported
they had four five species of what might loosely be called birds and something that could easily be classed as a reptile and a carnivorous mammal the size of a cat with bird like claws and a herb wore almost identical with the pig like thing in the big dar hull of a mural and another like a gazelle with a single horn in the middle of its forehead
the daily news cast from tara showed a corresponding shift in interest at home
tones found the martians
it was locked from me inside and we had a burn it down with a torch that's where they are
lora standish who had dropped in for lunch was on the menin fairly screaming into a radial phone extension doesn't an a half of them
well of course they dead what a question
martha remembered the close door on the first survey they hadn't attempted opening it
now it was burned away at both sides and lay still hot along the edges on the floor of the big office room in front
a flood light was on in the room inside and latimer was going around looking at things while a space force officers stood by the door
mass suicide that's what it was notice whats in the corners
yes charcoal
so they just came in here and lit the char hole and sat drinking together till they all fell asleep
the tearing public wanted to hear about martians and if live martians couldn't be found a room full of dead ones was the next best thing
tony latimer the discoverer was beginning to cash in on his attentions to gloria and his ingratiation with cid he was always either making voice and image talks for tell cast or listening to the news from the home planet
without question he had become overnight the most widely known archologist in history
not that i'm int interested in all this for myself he disclaimed after listening to the tells from tara two days after his discovery
bringing it to the public attention dramatize it
so i believe i shall go back at least for a while and see what i can do
lectures
the organization of a society of martian archology with anthea latimer p age d the logical candidate for the chair
i'll be glad to try sir he replied
inside a secret rocket tell e during device was mountain on its test stand
this is in part of your testing routine as it
another engineer rushed toward the door to see what was happening outside
electronic equipped cascaded from the wall shelves and a heavy duty chain hoist came loose from its overhead track plunging to the four with a terrifying crash
an instant later it crashed over pinning mark favour beneath it
bud threw up his arms to protect himself but too late
for minutes no one stirred among the wreckage
then tom who had been stunned by some falling debris raised himself to a sitting position
tom's eyes focus in horror on the wreckage enveloped by still billowing dust
the sky was visible through several gaping holes in the roof which was sagging dangerously on its supporting tresses
the young inventor had just noticed his friend lying pin beneath a heavy beam near by
his friend's eyelids flickered
we'd better not try to move him tom decided well get an ambulance
they pick their way through the wreckage and emerged on a scene of frightful destruction
let's see about getting help for mister favor
and the only truck we had available was in that burning shed the superintendent added bitterly
anyhow we want to help got a job for us
within minutes tom was in charge of clearing away rubble and extricating anyone who might be trapped inside the buildings
the telephone line was soon repaired and a steady stream of rescue vehicles began arriving from harkness fire trucks three ambulances and private cars driven by volunteers
the two girls were as much upset as tom's mother tom laughed
mister swift came into the living room just then and told tom how worried missus swift and sandy had been
he smiled guiltily as he added but i must admit i was more than a little concerned myself
he's a great scientist
tom nodded unhappily
male or female human or animal
mister swift's eyes twinkled
fortunately will halley was not a man in a hurry and did not use oppressive canvass or as mass would inevitably have come down
john mangles therefore hoped that the wretched whole would reach port without accident but it grieved him that his companions should have to suffers so much discomfort from the defective arrangements of the brig
their friends did their best to amuse him
their minds were so distracted at this change of route as to be quite unhinged
much as they had been interested in his dissertation on the pompous or australia his lectures u new zealand fell un cold and indifferent ears
his eyes wandered ceaselessly over the blind horizon
what then my lord
god keep us from such a meeting why john
we could not even fly fly john
yes my lord we should try in vain
we would fight to the death of course but after that
think of lady glenarvan think of mary grant
will halley is a brute but i am keeping my eyes open and if the coast looks dangerous i will put the ships had to see again
so that on that scored there is little or no danger
but asked to getting alongside the duncan god forbid
they were not to leave it again till the tops of the wa heed ranges were lit for the first fires of day
they had one night in which to prepare for death
the meal ended
sleep which keeps all sorrow in a vance soon wi down their eyelids they slept in each other's arms overcome by exhaustion and prolonged watching
if it is decreed that we die to morrow let us die bravely like christian men ready to appear without terror before the supreme judge
god who reads our hearts knows that we had a noble end in view
glenarvan's voice firm till now faltered
john you have promised mary what i promise lady helena what is your plan
i believe said john that in the sight of god i have a right to fulfill that promise
my lord wh ever of us survives the other will fulfill the wish of lady helena and mary grant
at last the major said my friends keep that to the last moment
the jailer may forget that he is u guard the prisoner never forgets that he is guarded
on that side descent was impossible and had it been possible bottom was shut in by the enormous rock
this said he motioning them to stoop

wilson and open nett join their companions in all united to dig through the wall john with his dagger the others with stones taken from the ground or with their nails while mad stretched along the ground watched the native guard through a crevice of the mattie
what could be the object
did they know of the existence of the prisoners or was a some private enterprise that let to the undertaking
their fingers bled but still they worked down after a half an hour they had gone three feet deep they perceived by the increase sharpness of the sounds that only a thin lair of earths prevented immediate communication
john mangles inserting the blade of its poniard avoided the knife which not protruded above the soil but seized the hand that wielded of it
but softly as the name was breathed merry grand already awakened by the sound to the hut slipped over towards glenarvan and seizing the hand all stained with earth she covered it with kisses
watch the savages outside said robert
round his body was rolled a long coil of flax rope
my child my child murmured lady helena the savages did not kill you
once there was a father who thought he would build for his children a beautiful home putting into it everything they could need or desire throughout their lives
the sweetest perfumes floated through the air while thousands of birds answered the musick of fountains with songs
why did he give that so odd to shape or so strange a cuffing
and so through many questions and many experiments they learn at last how to use the contents of this one storehouse
the entrance light because it opened so wide but we can see that the floor sloped downward and the way looks dark and narrow before us
walk down the sloping footpath now and be careful to keep out of the way of the little cars that are coming and going on eh side of you loaded on one side and empty on the other and seeming to run up and down by themselves
look a little closer while our guide lets the light of his lamp fall upon the black wall at your side
see beneath your feet if the marking of great tree trunks lions land across the floor and the forms of gigantic palm leaves strode among them
here is something different round it like n shell you can split off one side and behold there is the knot les snugly as does any test nut in its spur
ferns and palms mosses in trees in animals all perfected all beautiful and yet all hidden away under this hill and turned into shining black clo now i can very well remember when i first saw a coal fire and how odd it looked to see what seems to be burning stones
for when i was little girl we always had logs a wood blazing in an open fireplace and so did many other people and cold was just coming into use for few
what should we have done if everybody had capped on burning wood to this day
these forest were of trees different in some ways from those we have now great ferns is tallest of house and modus as high its little trees and palm leaves of enormous size
then the hills were piled up on top of it all but here and there some edge of a coal bed was tilted up and appeared above the ground
but by and by the wiseman thought about it and said to themselves we must find out what useful purpose god may be gasp for we know that he does not make anything for harm only
it was only a trouble to the gasp makers who had no use for it and even though it away until some one more thoughtful than the others found out that water would not pass through it
don't you see how many uses we have found for this refuse coal tar
when your hands or lips are cracked and rough from the cold does your mother ever put on glistering to heal them
one who rites of such an era labors under a troublesome disadvantage
in the present case that disadvantage is doubled for while the sins of the church however heinous were still such as admit of being expressed in words this ends of the heathen world against which she fought were utterly indescribable and the christian apologist is thus compelled for the sake of decency to state the church's case far more weakly than the facts deserve
not be it ever remembered that the slightest suspicion of immorality attaches either to the heroine of this book or to the leading philosophers of her school for several centuries
that divine word who is the light who light ath every man which cometh into the world had awakened in the heart of mankind a moral craving never before felt in any strength except by a few isolated philosophers or profits
the very emperors had arrayed themselves on her side
julians last attempt to restore paganism by imperial influence had only proved that the old faith had lost all hold upon the hearts of the masses had his death the great tide wave of new opinion rolled on unchecked and the rulers of earth were fig to swim with the stream to accept and words at least the church's laws as their to acknowledge a king of kings to whom even they owed homage and obedience and to call their own slaves their poor brethren and often to their spiritual superiors
but if the emperors had become christian the empire had not
in the meanwhile the minds of men cut a drift from their ancient moorings wandered wildly over pathless seas of speculative debt and especially in the more metaphysical un contemplate to least attempted to sol for themselves the questions of man's relation to the unseen by those thousand schism heresies and theosophy it is a disgrace to the word philosophy to call them by it on the records of which the student now gazes bewildered unable alike to count or to explain their phantasies
they brought before the minds of churchmen a thousand new questions which must be solved unless the church was too relinquish forever her claims as the great teacher and satisfied of the human soul
but the health of a church depends not merely on the creed which it professes not even on the wisdom and holiness of a few great ecliptic but on the faith and virtue of its individual members

how iniquitous was the conduct of the sons of theodosius in refusing the usual bounty by which the goths were bribed not to attack the empire the whole pent up deluge burst over the plains of italy and the western empire became from that day forth a dying idiot while the new invaders divided europe among themselves
the countless treasures which five centuries of rapine had accumulated around the capital had become the prey of men clothed in sheepskins and horse hide and the sister of an emperors had found her beauty virtue and pride of race worthily matched by those of the hard handed northern hero who led her away from italy as his captive and his bride to found new kingdoms in south france and spain and to drive the newly arrived vandals across the straits of gibraltar into the then blooming coastland northern africa

the room had neither carpet nor fireplace and the only movables in it were a sofa bed a table and an armchair all of such delicate and graceful forms as may be seen on ancient vases of a far earlier period than that whereof we write
but most probably had any of us enter that room that morning we should not have been able to spare a look either for the furniture or the generally fact or the museum gardens or the sparkling mediterranean beyond but we should have agreed that the room was quite rich enough for human eyes for the sake of one treasure which it possessed and beside which nothing was worth a moments glance

there is fruit with lentils and rice waiting for you in the next room and bat unless so despise it too much
strange that men should be content to grovel and be men when they might rise to the rank of gods
not that such a creature is that disturbs me no created thing i hope can move my equanimity but if i could stoop to hate i should hate her hate her
and her voice took a tone which made it somewhat uncertain weather in spite of all the lofty impassibility which she felt bound to possess she did not hate palatia with a most human and mundane hatred
his excellency madam the prefect
and why should that disturb me let him enter
chaster rambles and modoc memories
arctic beauty and desolation with their blessings and dangers only be found here to test the endurance and skill of adventurous climbers but far better than climbing the mountain is going around its warmed fertile base enjoying its bounties like a bee circling around a bank of flowers
perhaps the profession of doing good may be full but everybody should be kind at least to himself
go quietly alone no harm will befall you
but it is far better to go a foot
one blanket will be enough to carry or you may forego the pleasure in burden altogether as wood for fires as everywhere abundant
only a little food will be required
thus one saunters on and on in the glorious radiance in utter peace and forgetfulness of time
yet strange to say there are days even here somewhat dull looking when the mountain seems uncommunicative sending out no appreciable invitation as if not at home
at such time its height seems much less as if crouching and weary it were taking rest
every crystal dances responsive to the touches of the sun and the currents of sap in the growing cells of all the vegetation are ever in a vital whirl and rush and though many feet in wings are folded how many are astir
slight rain storms are likely to be encountered in a trip round the mountain but one may easily find shelter beneath well fetched trees that shed the rain like a roof
then the shining of the wet leaves is delightful and the steamy fragrance and the burst of birds song from the multitude of thrushes and finches and warblers that have nests in the chapparal
a thousand thousand voices are heard but so finely blended they seem a park of the night itself and make a deeper silence
and setting out from strawberry valley by bearing off to the northwestward a few miles you may see
in approaching it it suspicious looking yellow spotted hood and watchful attitude will be likely to make you go cautiously through the bog word stands as if you were approaching a dangerous snake
it is lined with ember algy and mosses and shaded with alder willow and thorn bushes which give it a fine setting
it is three or four miles long and terminates at an elevation of about nine thousand five hundred feet above sea level in morine sprinkled ice cliffs sixty feet high
the long grey slopes leading up to the glacier seen remarkably smooth and unbroken
most of the drainage of the glacier vanishes at once in a prest rocks to appear in springs and the distant valley and it is only in time of flood that the channel carries much water then there are several fine falls in the gorge six hundred feet or more and height
chasing this wild changing channel gorge gui or canyon the sections will show mount shasta as a huge pali cess containing the records layer upon lair of strange contrasted events in its fiery i see history
regaining the low ground at the base of the mountain and holding on in your grand orbit you passed through a belt of juniper woods called the cedars to sheep bog at the foot of the shasta pass
here he strike the old emigrant road which leads over the low divide to the eastern slopes of the mountain
m bremer as the most noted stronghold of the sheep and the whole chaster region
large flocks dwell here from year to year winter and summer descending occasionally into the adjacent sage plans and lava beds to feed but ever ready to take refuge in the jagged crags of their mountain and every alarm
while travelling with a company of hunters i saw about fifty in one flock
though meal deer are nearly as heavy
their long massive ears give them a very striking a parents
b neither the glorified woods on their one hand nor the lake on the other could at first hold the eye
then fell the gloaming making everything still more forbidding in mysterious
then darkness like death
two or three miles farther on as the main stronghold of the mots held by them so long and defiantly against all the soldiers that could be brought to the attack
the docks less wary kept their places merely swimming in and out through openings in the rushes rippling the glassy water and raising spangles and their wake
they were broad rugged crevassed cloud like masses of down grinding ice pouring fourth streams of muddy water as measures of the work they are doing and sculptural the rocks beneath them very unlike the long majestic glaciers of a alaska that river like go widing down the valleys through the forests to the sea
thus the chas a rivers issues from a large lake like spring and cast of valley and about two thirds of the volume of them a cloud gushes forth in a grand spring on the east sigh the mountain a few miles back from its immediate base
should the volume of the stream where you strike it seemed small then you will know that you are above the spring if large nearly equal to its volume at its confluence with the pit river than you are below it and in either case have only to fall the river up or down until you come to it
under certain conditions you may hear the roar of the water rushing from the rock at a distance of half a mile or even more or you may not hear it until within a few rods
the vivid green of the boulders beneath the water is very striking and colors the entire stream with the exception of the portions broken into foam
asplenium it be lob who cara hazel dogwood and alder make a luxurious fringe and setting and the forests of duglas s bruce along the banks are the finest i have ever seen in the sierra
tracing rivers to their fountains makes the most charming of travels
as the life blood of the landscapes the best of the wilderness comes to their banks and not one dull passage is found in all their eventful histories
tracing them m cloud to its highest springs and over the divide to the fountains of fall river near fort crook thence down that river to its confluence with the pit on from there to the volcanic region about lassen's beaut through the big meadows among the sources of the feather river and down through forests of sugar pine to the fertile plains of chico this is a glorious saunter and imposes no hardship
the ascent of lassen's mute is an easy walk and a views from the summit are extremely telling
the lofty icy shasta towering high above all seems but an hours walk from you though the distance in an air line is about sixty miles
the big meadows lie near the foot of lassen's mute a beautiful spacious basin set in the heart of the richly forested mountains scarcely surpassed in the grandeur of its surroundings by too
the great wilds of our country once held to be boundless and inexhaustible are being rapidly invaded and overrun in every direction and everything destructible in them is being destroyed
every landscape low and high seems doom to be trampled and harried
when we took our seats at the breakfast table it was with the feeling of being no longer looked upon as connected in any way with this case
instantly they absorbed all my attention though i dared not give them a directed look and continued to observe them only in the glass
yes and a very respectable one
the lady is not the mother of the boys but there aunt
the boys belonged to the gentleman who is a widower
george nodded
the boys looked quite awake enough is the father does not
do they still insist that miss challoner was the only person in the room with them at this time
george
have you ever thought that she might have been a suicide
i know it sounds foolish but the alternative is so improbable
the boys look wide awake enough but who can tell i would sooner believe that
a man was looking in from the corridor behind at the four persons we were just discussing
i enquired of george with my eyes still on this furtive watcher
i took quite to fancy to him why
i am looking at him now
just in everyday deductive but ambitious i suppose and quite alive to the importance of being thorough
yes he's more curl in all his movements
what does he want
i asked as soon as george had returned to my side
he wants me to stand ready to obey any summons the police may send me
i emphasized complacently
he appeared to know for he told me at once that he was detective gryce a man who had grown old in solving just such baffling problems as these
he gave up works sometime ago i have been told my husband went on but evidently a great case still has its learn ment for him
the trail here must be a very blind one for them to call him in
i wish we had not left so son
he was late of course but when he did appear i almost forgot our usual greeting in my hurry to ask him if he had seen the evening papers
however a little later we had a comfortable chat
it was one which gave me a small triumph over george
the suggestion he had laughed at was not so entirely foolish as he had been pleased to consider it
their greeting was cordial and the lines on the latter's face relaxed a little as he met the still bright eye of the man upon whose instinct and judgment so much reliance had always been placed
this is very good of you he began glancing down at the aged detective s bundled up legs and gently pushing a chair towards him
it's the most inexplicable there
but close there are absolutely none
that is we have not been able to find any perhaps you can
at least that is what we hope
it's a case in a thousand gryce
the old man's eyes shot fire and unconsciously one foot slipped to the floor
she had no companion near her
no word no cry just a collapse and sudden fall
in olden days they would have said struck by a bolt from heaven
what do you make of it gryce
i should like to see the desk you speak of and the spot where she fell
a young fellow who had been hovering in the background that once stepped forward
he was the plain faced detective who had spoken to george
this sweetwater as they called him was i have since understood one of his proteges and more or less of a favourite
then over the ground studied the affair carefully
very well then your ina position to pre near me
well well that's honestest at all events
but i in no position to make promises
old days don't return for the asking
whether he got anything else it would be impossible to say from his manner as he finally sank into a chair by one of the openings and looked down on the lobby below
one or two of the musicians from the end of the hall
naturally they reached her first
mark sour be and clouds hin burg
honest germans men who have played here for years
who came next on the scene some people from the lobby
anybody before the father came in
yes miss clark the middle aged lady with the parishes
i suppose she has been carefully questioned perry i should say
and she speaks of no weapon
not till the doctor came her doctor was happily in his office in this very building
yes mister slatter the assistant manager who was the m lobby at the time says that ten minutes at least must have elapsed
no down
sweetwater some one drew that weapon
not altogether by me
where ever she pleases only i can't walk far
it has not been running since last night or it would be full of curious people all the time hustling to get a glimpse of this place
but they'll put a man on for you
very good managed as you will
i'll way ter till youre ready explain yourself to the lady tell her i'm an old and romantic invalid who has been used to asking his own questions
as her quite figure appeared in the doorway sweetwater stole a glance at mister gryce
there was no doubting them in this instance
yes
for some little time that is it seemed long though i believe it was not more than a minute before two men came running from the musician's gallery
yes many times
what made the difference
miss clark started and her sweet face showed a moment's perplexity did i she queried musingly
no a very natural one i should say
and the glance she cast him while not meeting his eye showed that she understood the importance of the admission
i know she said what you are going to ask me now
there was no pared in the wood
the time is narrowed down to one and in that one miss clark was the only person to touch her
i will trouble you no further
sweetwater health me out of this
but vigor returned to him before he had well reached the door and he showed some of his old spirit as he thanked miss clark and turned to take the elevator
the next minute she was in this lady's farms
no weapon protruded from the world nor was any found on or near her in the mason what follows
she struck the blow herself and the strength of purpose which led her to do this gave her the additional force to pull the weapon out and fling it from her
it did not fall upon the floor around her therefore it flew through one of those openings into the lobby and there it either will be or has been fou
with an education which op to have insured me an honorable standing in the world with some intelligence wit good literary and scientific knowledge and endowed with those accidental physical qualities which are such a good passport into society i found myself at the age of twenty the mean follower of a sublime heart in which if great talent is rightly admired mediocrity is as rightly despised
i was compelled by poverty to become a member of a musical band in which i could expect neither esteem nor consideration and i was well aware that i should be the laughing stock of the persons who had known me as a doctor and divinity as an ecclesiastic and as an officer in the army and had welcome me in the highest society
i felt that in my first profession as i was not blessed with the vocation necessary to it i should have succeeded only by dint of hypocrisy and i should have been despicable in my own estimation even if i had seen the purple mantle on my shoulders for the greatest dignities cannot silence a man's own conscious
besides i was of opinions that a man's profession whatever it might be ought to supply him with enough money to satisfy all his once and the very poor pay of an officer would never have been sufficient to cover my expenses because my education had given me greater once than those of officers and general
are scandalous proceedings often exposed us to the greatest danger
we would very often spend the whole night rambling about the city inventing in carrying int execution the most impertinent practical jokes
we did the same with physicians whom we often sent half dress to some nobleman who was enjoying excellent health
whenever we could contrive to get into a church tower we thought a great fund of frightened all the parish by ringing the alarm bell as if some fire had broken out but that was not all we always cut the bell ropes so that in the morning the churchwardens had no beings of summoning the faithful to early mass
this is the amusing adventure which closed our exploits
in everyone of the seventy two perishes of the city of venice there is a large public house caught magazine
yet there are of few private rooms which contain a table surrounded with benches in which a respectable family or a few friends can enjoy themselves in a decent way
the waiter of the magazine came to be paid and our chief gave him what was due in joining silence under penalty of death
we took our three prisoners to a large boat
where is my husband
never fear you shall see him again to morrow
my readers may imagine whether we felt inclined to laugh when the charming creature bade us good night thinking us all with perfects good faith
two days afterwards are nocturnal orgy began to be talked of
and went on to say that the two men who had carried her off had taken her to such a place where they had an hour later been met by the other six and that they had all repaired to the two swords where they had spent an hour and drinking
there was no cowardly trader amongst us although we were all poor but fear had its effect and o maternal pranks were not renewed
i picked it up and coming up to him just as he was going down the steps i handed it to him
i told him and he insisted upon my coming with him in the gondola saying that he would leave me at my house
i rubbed it with all my strength but he told me in a sort of indistinct whisper that the numbness was spreading all along the left side and that he was dying
i jumped out of the gondola and fought myself on the very spot where three years before i had taught rosetta such a forcible lesson i inquired for a surgeon at the first coffee house and ran to the house that was pointed out to me
taking everything upon myself i ordered a servant to hurry out for a physician who came in a short time and ordered the patient to be blood again thus approving the first bleeding prescribed by me
thinking i had the right to watch the sick man i settled myself near his bed to give him every care he required
it did not know who i was and did not like to ask me whilst i thought it better to preserve a modest silence
he had gambled and lost a great deal and his brother was as most bitter enemy because he was infatuated with the idea that he had tried to poison him
the physician who attended him was named tero he thought by some peculiar train of reasoning that he could cure him by applying and material ointment to the chest to which no one raised any objection
delighted with such a fortunate result we lay down again
he entreated me to tell him the truth
what extraordinary things will sometimes occur from mere chance or from the force of circumstances
unwilling to hurt his vanity by telling him that he was mistaken i took the wild resolution of informing him in the presence of his two friends that i possessed a certain numeral calculus which gave answers also in numbers to any questions i like to put
i obeyed implicitly and met your excellency
the three friends were astound it
i declared myself quite willing for it was necessary to brazen it out after having ventured as far as i had done
he wrote the question and gave it to me i read it i could not understand either the subject or the meeting of the words but it did not matter i had to give an answer
if the question was so obscure that i cannot make out the sense of it it was natural that i should not understand the answer
they all asked me how long i would require to teach them the rules of my sublime calculus
not very long i answered aunt i will teach you as you wish although the hermit assured me that i would die suddenly within three days if i communicated my science to anyone but i have no faith whatever in that prediction
they believe that through me they possessed the philosophers stone the universal panacea the intercourse with all the elementary heavenly and infernal spirits and they had no doubt whatever that thanks to my sublime science they could find out the secrets of every government in europe
but although believing fully in my oracles they were too kindhearted to think them the work of the double and en suited their natural goodness better to believe my answers inspired by some heavenly spirit
they were not only good christians and faithful to the church but even real devotees and full of scruples
as for the eucharist trans substantiation the real presence it was all no mystery to them but palpable evidence and yet they were not jesuits
i might be told that if i had wished to follow the rules of pure morality i ought either to have declined intimate intercourse with them or to have undeceived them
besides i found it very flattering to my vanity to become the subject of the speck the lived chattering of empty fools who having nothing us the do and always trying to find out the cause of everye moral phenomena they made with which their narrow intellect cannot understand
whoever you may be i am indebted to you for my life
your apartment is ready you may send your clothes you shall have a servant a gondola at your orders my own table in ten sequins a month
you needed not think of the future think only of enjoying yourself and take me as your adviser in everything th may happen to you in everything you may wish to undertake and you may be certain of always finding me your friend
i threw myself at his feet to assure him of my gratitude and embraced him calling him my father
sir edwards not wholly discouraged by the denial with which dorriforth had with delicacy acquainted him still hoped for a kind reception and was so often at the house of missus horton that lord frederick's jealousy was excited and the tortures he suffered in consequence convinced him beyond a doubt of the sincerity of his affection
every time he beheld the object of his passion for he still continued his visits though not so frequently as here to fore he pleaded his cause with such ardour that miss woodley who was sometimes present and ever compassionate could not resist wishing him success
yet did the watchful miss woodley often times here a sigh escape from her unknown to herself till she was reminded of it and then a sudden blush would instantly overspread her face
night after night his sleep had been disturbed by fears for her when abroad mourning after morning it had been broken by the clamour of her return
i hope miss milner you pass this evening at home
i thought miss milner you gave me your wor that you would pass this evening at home
yes indeed and i believe it is right that i should keep my first promise is it not
missus horton rose from her seat moved the decanters and fruit round the table stirred the fire and came back to her seat again before another word was uttered
nor had this good woman's officious labours taken the least from the awkwardness of the silence which as soon as the bustle she had made was over returned in its full force
miss milner you shall not leave the house this evening sir
and he walked immediately out of the apartment by another door
her hand fell motionless from that which she held she appeared motionless herself till missus horton beseeching her not to be uneasy at the treatment she had received made her tears flow as if her heart was breaking
it was not from any real cause of grief that she wept but there was a magnetic quality and tears which always attracted hers
do you think i would go answered miss milner with an eagerness that for a time suppressed her tears in contradiction to his will
if you think so mather i see nothing that should prevent me now
niece i command you not to stir out of the room is evening
miss woodley obediently sat down and though her thoughts and heart were in the chamber of her friend she never marked by one impertinent word or by one line of her face the restraint she suffered
at the usual hour mister dorriforth and his word were summoned to tea he entered with a countenance which evinced the remains of anger his eye gave testimony of his absent thoughts and though he took up a pamphlet affecting to read it was plain to discern that he scarcely knew he held it in his hand
miss woodley thought it her duty to be mute and now the jingle of a teaspoon was like a deep toned bell all was so quiet
missus horton too in the self approving reflection that she was not in a quarrel or altercation of any kind felt herself at this moment remarkably peaceful and charitable
miss woodley did not recollect herself so but was so in reality in her a peas in charity were instinctive virtues accident could not increase them
he coughed drank his tea endeavor to talk but found it difficulty sometimes red and in this manner near two hours were passed away when miss milner came into the room not dressed for a ball but as she had risen from dinner
dora forth red on and seemed afraid of looking up lest he should see what he could not have pardoned
after a few minutes pause and some little embarrassment on a part of missus horton at the disappointment she had to encounter from this unexpected dutiful conduct she asked miss milner if she would now have any tea
dora forth then laid the book out of his hand and by the time the servant had left the room thus began
it is often the ungrateful task of a friend to be troublesome sometimes unmannerly
forgive the duties of my office and believe that no one is half so much concerned if it rubs you of any degree of happiness as i myself a
what he said he looked with so much sincerity that had she been burning with rage at his late behaviour she must have forgiven him for the regret which he so forcibly expressed
she was going to reply but found she could not without accompanying her words with tears therefore after the first attempt she desisted
on this he rose from his chair and going to her said once more show youre submission by obeying me a second time to day
keep your appointment and be assured that i shall issue my commands with more circumspection for the future as i find how strict me they are complied with
in the last communication which he had received from lady milburgh she had scolded him in terms that were for her severe because he had not returned to his wife and taken her off with him to naples
and now had come to pass that his soul remaining ally mister samuel ble the ex policemen was becoming weary of his service
at last he sent were to say that he himself would be in england before the end of march and would see that the majesty at the law should be vindicated in his favor
in making this he had expected no success though from the energetic nature of his disposition he had made the attempt with some zeal
missus bazil was disposed to think that ladies e quality among whom madame tea was entitled in her estimation to take rank were seldom better than they ought to be and she was quite willing that her husbands should earn his bread by watching the lady or the lady's lover
and had the case been brought before the judge ordinary by means of her husband's exertions she would have taken pleasure in reading every word of the evidence even though her husband should have been ever so roughly handled by the lawyers
a distinct promise of a hundreds pounds was made to him if he would have the child ready to hand over to trevanion on travilla's arrival in england
of course date said missus bazil
the paternal parent has a right to his infants no doubt that was basil's law
he can't suckle him canny
when a married woman has followers and the husband don't go the wrong side of the post too or it ain't proved again him that he do they'll never letter have nothing to do with the children
i'll tell you what it is be exclaimed missus bazil it's my belief as he ain't quite right up here and missus bil touched her forehead
dread e all what is it they wants they don't know what they wants
it's that is makes him i won't say what
but as for this here child be
trevanion had followed his letter quicker than he had intended when it was written and was now with his prime minister before his prime minister had been able to take any action on the last instruction received
does one mister samuel basle live here asked travilla
then bazil came forward and introduced his wife
but trevanion was of a different opinion and he was dispensed and revolted most unreasonably by the appearance of his minister's domestic arrangements
basle had always waited upon him with a decent coat and a well brushed hat and clean shoes
it is very much easier for such men as mister bazil to carry decency of appearance about with them th to keep it at home
perhaps you could put on your coat and walk out with me for a few minutes said t rebellion
missus bull who well understood that business was business and that wives were not business felt no anger at this and handed her husband his best coat
basle away from his own home out on business with his coat buttoned over his breast and his best half in his hand was aware that he commanded respects and he could carry himself accordingly
i do not suppose that anybody will question my right to have the care of my own child said travelling
if you would have gone to mister skin sir suggested bazil
as he went about his eyes were ever cast downwards and he walked with a quick shuffling gate and he suspected others feeling that he himself was suspected
and all work had ceased with him
he's up in answer a minding of the parliamentary duties
i've watched a sharp is watching can go pretty near
but if you ask me my opinion why in course they've been together somewhere
and ble as he said this smiled almost allowed
and he did go away leaving ble standing in the middle of stony walk
master and man dismounted from their beasts and as soon as they had settled themselves at the foot of the trees sancho who had had a good no time meal that day let himself without mor ad passed the gates of sleep
but don quixote whom his thoughts far more than hunger kept awake could not close an e and roan in fancy to and fro through all sorts of places
at one moment it seemed to him that he was in the cave of montesinos and saw dulcinea transformed into a country wench skipping and mounting upon her shes again that the words of the sage merlin were sounding in his ears setting forth the conditions to be observed and the exertions to be made for the disenchantment of dulcinea
who is stating me and i'd dressing me
dulcinea is bashing thou art living on regardless i am dying of hope deferred therefore u thus thyself with a good will for min it is here in this retired spot to give the at least two thousand glashes
seeing this sancho got up and grappling with his master he gripped him with all his might in his arms giving him a trip with the heel stretched him on the ground on his back and pressing his right me on his chest held his hands in his own so that he could neither move nor breathed
how no tracer exclaimed doni or
dost i'll revolt against thy master and that your lord
dost thou rise against him who gives thee his bread
don quixote gave his promise and swore by the life of his thoughts not to touch so much as a hair of his garments and to leave him entirely free and to his own discretion to whip himself whenever he placed
sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot but as he was about to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touch his head and putting up his hands encountered somebody's two feet with shoes and stockings on them
he trembled with fear and made for another tree where the very same thing happened to him and he fell a shouting calling upon don quixote to come and protect him
dont qui o take did so and ask him what it happened to him and what he was afraid of
sancha replied that all the trees were full of men's feet and legs
don quixote was on foot with his horse unbridled and his lance leaning against a tree and in short completely defenseless he thought it best therefore to fold his arms and bow his head and reserve himself for a more favorable occasion and opportunity
he was mounted upon a powerful horse and had on a coat of male with four of the pistols they call petrels in that country at his waist
he saw that his wires for so they call those who follow that trade were about to rifle sancho panza but he ordered them to desist and was at once obeyed so the girdle escaped
he saw me he paid court to me i listen to him and unknown to my father igh loved him for there is no woman however secluded she may live w close she may be kept who will not have opportunities and despair for following her headlong impulses
in a word he pledged himself to be mine and i promised to be his without carrying matter siny further
give me my horse and arms and wait for me here i will go in quest of this night and dad or alive i will make him keep his word plighted to so great beauty
nobody needed have any doubt about that said sancho for my master has a very happy knack of match making it's not many days since he forced another man marry who in the same way backed out of his prise to another maiden and if it had not been for his persecutors the enchanters changing the man's proper shape into lackeys the said maiden would not be won this minute
they made haste overtake them which as the party moved slowly they were able to do with these
the wounded gentleman opened his all but closed eyes and recognizing claudia said i see clearly fa and mistaken lady that it is thou that h slain mere a punishment not merited or deserved by my feelings toward thee for never did i mean to nor could i wrong me in thought or deed
it is not true then said claudia the thou were going this morning to marry leonora the daughter of the rich valves
on perceiving this claudia when she had convinced herself that her beloved husband was no more rent the air with her size and made the heaven's ringing with her lamentations she tore her hair and scattered it to the winds she beat her face with her hands and showed all the signs of grief and sorrow that could be conceived to come from an afflicted heart
cruel reckless woman she cried how easily wort thou moved to carry out a thoughts a wicked
oh husband whose unhappy fate in being mine hath born me from the barrage bed to the grave
the servants wept clodius swooned away again and again and the whole place seemed a field of sorrow and an abode of misfortune
claudia told him she meant to go to a monastery of which an a of hers was a base where she intended to pass her life with a better and everlasting spouse
claudia would not on any account allow him to accompany her and thanking him for his offers as well as she could took leave of him in tears
sancho said they had but that three kerchiefs that were wor three cities were missing
what are you talking about man
said one of the bystanders i have got them and they are not worth three reals
at this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels on the roads to watch you came along them and report what passed to their chief came up and said signor there is a great thrup of people not far off coming along the road to barcelona
what led me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance which is strum enough to disturbed the quietest hearts
and if you have any desire to shorten the journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation come with me and i will show you how to become a knight errant a calling wherein so many hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances they will lodge you in heaven in a trice
and now the squires despatched to make the prize came up bringing with them two gentlemen on horseback two pilgrims on foot and a coach ful of women with some six servants on foot and unhorse back and attendants on them and a couple of mule tears whom the gentlemen had with them
the captain showed plainly the concerned they felt the regions lady was downcast and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their property confiscated
the regions lady ordered one of her servants to give the eighty grounds that had been assessed as her share at once for the captains had already paid down their sixty
one of the squires observed in his mixture of gascon and catalan this captain of ours would make a better friar than highway man if he wants to be so generous another time let it be with his own property and not hours
they were all taken aback and not one of them dared to utter a word such deference did they pay him
he had been a clerk in a banking house and was transported for embezzlement though by some grave doubts as to his guilt were entertained
when the muster bell rang in up gang broke up rufus dos on his silent way to a separate cell observed a notable change of custom in the disposition of the new convict
i'm not to go in there says the ex ban clerk drawing back and dismay from the cloud of fal faces which lowered upon him
what does he more than anybody else said the wretched man to himself as he hugged his misery close
about donn the next morning mister north who amongst other vagaries not approved of by his bishop had a habit of prowling about the prison that unofficial hours was attracted by a dispute at the door of the dormitory
a prison a refractory your reverence said the watchman
wants to come out mister north
kirkland ghastly pale bleeding with his woolen shirt torn and his blue eyes lid open with terror was clinging to the bars
and beat on the bars with white and sweating hands
i order you sir north cried indignant
very sorry your reverence but your reverence knows that i daren't do such a thing
o you ministers of christ wolves th sheeps clothing you shall be judged for this
let him out cried north again stamping his foot
there's more trouble with you bloody aristocrats than enough lie quiet
you can guess what that unhappy boy has suffered
impertinent young beggar said burgs

it's hard for such young's
have you ever been in that that place i was in last night asked kerk lin
what do he care care
if you fall we must fall over you and then you're done for
he had hardly uttered the words when the boy flung himself beneath long
hold on to me miss nancy said the giant i'm big enough to carry double
but carlin kept steadily on for the river
just as he reached it however the figure of mister north rose from behind a pile of stones
curling jumped for the jetty missed his footing and fell into the arms of the chaplain
oll mister north says kirkland why did you stop me
must stop that fifty lashes proke
that last fellow you had ought to have been tight up himself
i won't have my men knocked up with flogging knees rascals

captain frere says that the scenery is delightful
abandoned indeed by god and man almost
and the valley of the shadow of death he is with us
you have not been long in the colony mister mean

i had the pleasure of meeting him in society
he is just married you know is he said burgs
the devil he is i heard something about it too
yes one oughtn't to leave the colony without seeing that says burgs it's worth seen
in fact the ring leader john recks gave me his confession and i sent it to the bishop
a great rascal put in north
well now said mean with asperity i don't agree with you
he seems to me to be truly penitent for as offenses a misguided but not a hypocritical man if my knowledge of human nature goes for anything i hope he is said north
there's no fear of him said burgs cheerily if he grows uproarious we'll soon give him a touch of the cat
i suppose severity is necessary returned macon though to my ears a flogging sounds a little distasteful
i have these attacks at times
the reverend meek and eyed his clerical brother with poor the reverend mean was not accustomed to clergyman in war black neckties smoke clay pipes jude tobacco and drank neat brandy out of tumblers
so they went on to the veranda and looked down upon the lights of the prison and listened to the sea lapping the shore
by and by a short figure smoking a sar came out of the dark and proved to be doctor maclay who had been prevented from attending the dinner by reason of an accident to a constable i norfolk bay which had claimed his professional attention
dead said doctor mack awe
delighted to see mister mon
the macklin was tired and wanted to get home
our roads lie together doctor
before the two clergyman had got halfway down the steep pat that led from the commandants house to the flat on which the cottages of the doctor and chaplin were built mack wain rejoined them
another flogging to morrow said he grumblingly
wh is he going to flog now
you don't mean to say he's going to flog crick lin
perhaps youll have the goodness to allow me to be the best judge of that returned maclay drying up as little body to its least insignificant stature
mister mon expressed some alarm but doctor mack away reassured him
we can't do anything without evidence complain
i shall find my port monte and my room you said yes yes
he sleeps at the back and north hurried off
an impulsive gentleman said meek int to mack away as the sound of mister north's footsteps died away in the distance
bacco wane shook his head seriously
he is the strangest fits at times
unless it's a cancer in the stomach i don't know what it can be cancer and the stomach
doctor we all have o crosses have we not
how delightful the grass smells
good night sir i hope you will be comfortable
i'll teach my prisoners to attempts suicide
that's mack always business
then don't you interfere what me sir
i've given my order sir
then captain burgs cried north is pale face flushing i tell you the boy's blood will be on your head
i am a minister of god sir and i forbid you to commit this crime
damn your impertinent sir burst out burgs
your dismissed officer of the goverment sir
this of course was mere bravado and the part of the commandant
north knew well that he would never dare to attempt any such active violence but the insults stung him like the cut of a whip
shall master north out he said and go down to the barracks until trope the cooly is to have a hundreds lashes to morrow
i'll show you whose master here my good sir
this is murderous
the government may go to and you too roared burgs cat out

i'll report this to the government
i wish i hadn't taken that brandy he said fool that i am
o god give me strength aid me help me
o lord looked down upon me
he mixed a teaspoon of this sin panic and of water and drank it
it relieved him for a while
it was as though he had reached the crisis of a disease which had been for days gathering force
i must have a teaspoonful he said to a lay the craving
twice he paused on the way to the sitting room and twice was he driven on by a power stronger than his will
he smelt the nutty a rome of the spirit
that at all times debasing at this particular time it was infamous that a vice unworthy of any man was doubly sinful in a man of education and a minister of gone in vain
in the midst of his arguments he found himself at the cupboard but the bottle at his lips in an attitude that was at once ludicrous and horrible
her meeting with letty was indescribably tender and the days set followed were pretty equally divided between her and her brother in nursing the one and loving the other
but even while she enjoyed every hour of life and begrudged the time given to sleep she felt as if the dream was too beautiful to last and oft and said
so christie turned to deaf heer to her prophetic soul and gave herself up the blissful holiday that had come at last
nothing can surprise me now i'm prepare for anything even the sight of my quakerish lover dancing a ja
i feel like a boy out of school or rather a man out of prison and must enjoy my liberty in some way
i'm not a talker you know and as the laws of gravitation forbid my soaring aloft anywhere i can only express my joyfully uplifted state of mind by prancing as you call it
i don't want you to i love to see you so young in happy only you are not the old daid and i've got to get acquainted with the new one
i hope you'll like a better than the frost bitten old day and you first knew and were kind enough to love
mother says i've gone back to the time before we lost letty and i sometimes feel as if i had
in that case you will find me a proud impetuous ambitious fellow christie a towel that suit
excellently i like pride of your sort impetuosity becomes you for you have led to control it if needed be and the ambition is best of all
i shall wait for time to show
then they went back to their work little dreaming as they tied roses and twine sim lax reefs how near that other chance was how soon they were to be called upon to keep their promise and how well each was to perform the part given them in life and death
to know home in the land did the great trouble bringing a more sudden change than the little cottage in the lane
david was sober enough now and went about his work with a grim set to his lips and a spark in his eyes that made the three women look at one another pale with unspoken apprehension
it is terrible and yet glorious
david held it close in both of his saying gratefully thank you mother then fixing his eyes on the younger yet not dearer women he added with a ring in his voice that made their heart answer with a prompt eye aye in spite of love or fear
the boys bless their brave hearts have done nobly but older men are needed now we cannot sacrifice all the gallant lads and we who have more to lose them they must take our turn and tried to do as well
yes david sister in sweetheart answered bravely forgetting in the fervour of the moment what heavy consequences god might see fit to send good
then it will take the garden in the green house off my hands this autumn for a year or longer if i like
he's a kind neighborly man and his boy will take my place about the house and protected fly
i knew you would go i saw you getting ready and i made up my mind full
will let me to it and in return i will marry you whenever you ask me answered christie sealing the promise with a kiss that silenced him
you've something to tell me i see it in your face dear i must go
next evening as missus sterling set alone in the twilight a tall man in army blue entered quietly stood watching the tranquil figure for a moment then went and knelt down beside it saying with a most unsure choking the voice
the loyal frenzy fell upon the three quiet women and they could not do too much for their country
it would have taken many knapsacks to hold all we gift showered upon him by his friends and neighbors
finding that lisa showed little enthusiasm on the subject she tried to else him by patriotic appeals of various sorts
very well said missus wilkins resolutely to herself if i can't make no impression on his soul i will on a stomach and see how ble work
we can't afford no nice fiddles now when our men are suffer so
he was not as unmoved as he seemed by the general excitement and had felt sundry manly and pulses to up in atom when his comrades in the shop discuss the crisis with ireful brandishing of all's invent pounding of sol weather as if the rebels were under the hammer
to say that the fish rose at once and swallowed the bit cookin but feebly expresses the justice done to the cakes by that long suffering men
can you remember what hepsey told us and call them poor long suffering creeds names
now he a it's a trainer added men lizzie
now cyn be you satisfied
and the inconsistent woman fell upon his button many breast weeping copiously
his wife said him with the fat of the land regardless of consequences his children revolved about him lift tireless curiosity and wonder his neighbors flocked into applaud advise an admire everyone treated him with a respects most grateful to his feelings he was objective interest and with everye his importance increased so that by night he felt like a commander in chief and bore himself accordingly
then the good soul openly shorted the bergen she had born so long in secret and bravely trudged on alone
the women dropped their work to look and listen for his visits were few and short and every instant was precious
they knew what it was without a word missus sterling clasped her hands and bowed her head
now let's be brave and enjoy every minute of it
we will what can i do for your davy asked cristy wonderfully supported by the thought that she was going to
as a married woman you will get on better as my wife you will be allowed to come to me if i need you and as my he stopped here for he could not add as my widow you will have my pension to support you
nothing can part us any more not even death for love like ours will last forever
not one david that's true love christie
then they stood quite still for a time and in the silence the two hearts talked together in the sweet language no tongue canter
surely i shall if i give you and myself to the cause and i do it gladly though i know that my heart has got to ache as it it never has ached yet when my courage fails as it will buy and by and my selfish soul counts the cost of my offering after the excitement is over
david caught the exaltation and gave no further thought to anything but the duty of the hour finding himself stronger and braver for that long look into the illuminated face of the woman he loved
the roses are for they remarked me of poor helen and the first tok i did with david was arranging flowers like these for a dead baby's little coffin
but i think few bride dress with a braver happier heart than mine though i do choose this over wedding gown answered christie smiling again as she took from the half packed trunk her new hospital suit of soft grey woolen stuff
mister power is waiting are you ready love quite ready
you young folks take a wedding trip to the green house while we see how we ween get on without you
david in christie went smiling away together and if they shed any tars over the brief happiness no one saw them but the flowers and they loyally kept the secret folded up in their tender hearts
a very simple little marriage feast but more love good will and tender wishes adorned the plain table than is often found it wedding breakfasts and better than any speech her song was letty s broken whisper that she folded her arms round to david's empty chair when no one saw her heaven bless and keep them bring him back to us
all watched with quickened bath and proud souls that living wave blue below and bite with a steely glitter above as it flowed down the street in a way to join the sea of dauntless hearts that for months had rolled up against the south and ebbed back reddened with the blood of men like these
then she saw david and the regiment became one man to her
i could not love me dear so much loved i not honor more
every elevation of the type man has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always be a society believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings and requiring slavery in some former or other
the distinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling cast pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled or among the ruled class the slaves and dependence of all sorts
we truthful ones the nobility in ancient grease called themselves
it is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to men and were only derivative and at later period applied to actions it is a gross mistake therefore when historians of morals start with questions like why have sympathetic actions be praised
he honours whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equals self glorification
probably a pessimistic suspicion with regarded the entire situation of man will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together with his situation
here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and evil power and dangerousness or assumed to reside in the evil a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit of being despised
according to slave morality therefore the evil man arouses fear according to master morality it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being
everywhere that slave morality gains the ascendancy language shows a tendency to approximate significations of the word good and stupid
he will even say for many reasons i can delight in the good opinion of others perhaps because i love and hour them and rejoice in all their joys perhaps also because their good opinion indorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhaps because the good opinions of others even in cases where i do not share it is useful to me or gives promise of usefulness all this however is not vanity
in fact conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order and its cause the blending of the blood of masters and slaves the original noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign of value to themselves and to think well of themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but it has at all times an older ampler and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to it and in the phenomenon of vanity this older propensity overmasters the younger
the most varied experienced teaches if what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists in spite of all gods and men and has hitherto ben victorious these qualities it calls virtues and these virtues alone it develops to maturity
variations whether they be deviations into the higher finer and rarer or deterioration and monstrosities appear suddenly on the scene in the greatest exuberance and splendor the individual dares to be individual and attach himself
at this turning point of history there manifest themselves side by side and often mixed and entangled together a magnificent manifold virgin forest like up growth and up striving a kind of tropical tempo in the rivalry of growth and an extraordinary decay and self destruction owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoism which strive with one another for sun and light and can no longer a sign any limit restraint or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality
nothing but new wise nothing but new hows no common formula as any longer misunderstanding and disregard in meg with each other decay deterioration and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled the genius of the race overflowing from all the corn cops of good and bad a portentous simultaneous ness of spring and autumn full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh still exhausted still unwearied corruption
dangers again present the mother of morality great danger this time shifted into the individual into the neighbour and friend into the street into their own child into their own heart into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and volitions
what will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have to preach
this is the problem of race
in our very democratic or rather very plebeian age education and culture must be essentially the art of deceiving deceiving with regard to origin with regard to the inherited plebeian ism and body and soul
the noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question and also without consciousness of harshness constraint or arbitrariness therein but rather is something that may have its basis in the primary law of things if he sought a designation for it he would say it is just as itself
on this account the people of one nation understand one another better than those belonging to different nations even when they use the same language or rather when people have lived long together under similar conditions of climate soil danger requirement toil their originates therefrom an entity that understands itself namely a nation
the greater the danger the greater is the need of agree quickly and readily about what is necessary not to misunderstand one another in danger that is what cannot at all be dispensed within intercourse
also when all loves and friendships one has the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery has been made that in using the same words one of the two parties has feelings thoughts intuitions wishes or fears different from those of the other
wh ever groups of sensations within a soul awaken most readily begin to speak and give the word of command these decide as to the general order of rank of its values and determine ultimately its list of desirable things
a man's estimates of value betrays something of the structure of his soul and wherein it sees its conditions of life its intrinsic needs
profound suffering makes noble its separates one of the most refine and forms of disguise is epicurism along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste which take suffering lightly and puts itself on the defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound
the highest instinct for purity places him who was affected with it in the most extraordinary and dangerous isolation as a saint for it is just holiness the highest spiritualization of the instinct in question
occasionally to the waking call comes to late the chance which is permission to take action when their best youths and strength for action have been used up in sitting still and how many a one just as he sprang up his found with horror that his limbs are benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy
and whoever thou art what is it that now pleases thee
only name it whatever i have i off thee
but you mis understand him when you complain about it
there must be a sort of repugnance and me to believe anything define about myself is there perhaps some enigma therein
probably but fortunately nothing from my own teeth perhaps it betrays the species to which i belong but not to myself as it is sufficiently agreeable to me but what has happened to you
i do not know he said hesitatingly perhaps the harpies of flown over my table
to suffocate with his memories to him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul and only seldom finds his table laid and his food prepared the danger will always be great nowadays however it is extraordinarily so
and to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice politeness
it was about mon when captain waver entered the straggling village or rather hamlet of tivy lon closer which was situated the mansion of the proprietor
the houses seemed miserable in the extreme especially to an ey accustomed to the smiling neatness of english cottages
occasionally indeed when such a consummation seemed inevitable a watchful grandam with her close cap is staff and spindle rush like a sybil and frenzy out of one of these miserable cells dashed into the middle of the path and snatching up her own charge from among the sun burnt loiterers saluted him with a sound cup and transported him back to his dungeon the little white headed varlets screaming all the while from the very top of his lungs are shrilly traveled to the growling remonstrances of the enraged matron
the evil and remedy such as it is still exists but this is remote from our present purpose and is only thrown out for consideration of the collectors under mister dense dog bill
yet the physiognomy of the people when more closely examined was far from exhibiting the indifference of stupidity their features were rough but remarkably intelligent grave but the very revers stupid and from among the young women an artist might have chosen more than one model whose features and form resembled those of minerva
this avenue was straight and of moderate lengths running between a double row a very ancient horse chestnuts planted alternately with sycamores which rose to such huge heights and nourish so luxuriantly that their bows completely overarched the broad road benny
it was one of those effects which of painter loves to represent and mingled well with the struggling light which found its way between the bows of the shady ark that vaulted the broad green alley
the house which seemed to consist of two or three high narrow and steep roofed buildings projecting from each other at rid angles formed one side of the enclosure
it had been built at a period when castles were no longer necessary and when the scottish architects had not yet acquired the art of designing a domestic presidents
neither did the front indicate absolute security from danger
stables and other offices occupied another side of the square
two battlemented walls one of which face the avenue in the other divided the cour from the garden completed the enclosure
this work of art was the wonder of the country ten miles round
the court was spacious well paved and perfectly clean there being probably another entrance behind the stables for removing the litter
everything around appeared solitary and would have been silent but for the continued plashing of the fountain and the whole scene still maintained the mastic illusion which the fancy of waverley had conte up
chapter thirty three a confidant
mister morton replied the far from making any claim upon his good opinion his only wish and the sole purpose of his visit was to find out the means of deserving it
evil to him that thinks otherwise said mister morton or who holds church government and ceremonies as the exclusive gauge of christian faith are moral virtue
mister morton seemed particularly struck with the account of waverley's visit to donald being ween
when i was a young man like you mister waverley any such heir brained expedition i beg your pardon for the expression would have had inexpressible charms for me
he certainly possesses talents beyond the rods fere in which he moves and being neither destitute of ambition nor encumbered with scruples he will probably attempt by every means to distinguish himself daring the period of these unhappy commotions
mister morton then made a careful memorandum of the various particulars of labor leas inter view with donald being lean and the other circumstances which he had communicated
he had neither sympathy with my innocence nor with my wretchedness and the petrify accuracy with which he attended every form of civility while he tortured me by his questions his suspicions and his inferences was as tormenting as the racks of the inquisition
they held conventicles in the open fields and being treated with great violence in cruelty by the scottish government were than once too gars during those reins
since that time their numbers have gradually diminished but a good many are still to be found in the western counties and several with the better temper than insano seven of now taken arms for government
it had no ornamentation being exceedingly plain an appearance
here said one of their guides as the procession halted before the little stone building is the palace of toirm who was our queen
what that little cabin
exclaimed trot a course
did you suppose of palace would be like one of our handsome residences asked the woman evidently surprised
these intruders are very peculiar people remarked man in the crowd
they seem very ignorant poor things said another in reply
the people must way outside for there is no room for them in the palace
so i followed her through the low archway and in a room beyond very simply furnished sat young girl engaged and darning a pair of pink stockings
she was a beautiful girl of about seventeen years of age not fat like all the rest of the pinkies but slender and well formed according to our own ideas of beauty
her complexion was not a decided pink but as soft rosy tint not much deeper than that of trot skin
what is it carrey she asked the woman
the queen dazed upon our friends with evident interest
she smiled a little sadly at trot seemed to approve of button bright opened frank face and was quite surprised because cap'n bill was so much bigger than her own people
are you a giant
perhaps you are trying to rider kill me she continued regarding the sailor's face closely
there is nothing majestic about me as you know very well
cory do you consider majesty a proper word to use when addressing it queen
even an america everybody boughs loaded our president and the blue skins are so fright of their boolooroo that they tremble whenever they go near him
but surely that is all wrongs said tomin gravely
therefore i am a mere agent to direct the laws which are the will of the people and i'm only a publick servant obliged constantly to guard the welfare of my subjects
in that case said button bright youre entitled to the best there is to pay for your trouble
if i lived as luxuriously as my people do and had servants and costly gowns the good pinkies would say that their queen had more than they themselves and it would be true
no our way as vest
the queen nothing with the power to execute the laws to adjust grievances and to compel order
i have won great privilege
after my death the pink marvel statue of me will be set up in the grand court with the statues of the other kings and queens who have ruled this land and all the pinkies and ages to come will then honour me as having bent a just and upright queen that is my reward
a mis fortune of birth placed me here and i cannot escape my fate
it is much more desirable to be a private citizen happy and care free
yes it was wet and sticky all right agreed the sailor but the big frog helped us and we got through all right
you are not like my people the pinkies and there is no place for you in our country
in all our history you are the first people from outside our borders who have ef stepped a foot in our land
we do not hate you as you say to blueskins do nora we savage or cool but we do not want you here and i'm really puzzled what to do with you
i'll look in the great book first
the savage philosopher the duel mind
the original attitude of the american indian toward the eternal the great mystery that surrounds and embraces us was his simple as it was exalted
it was silent because all speech is of necessity feeble and imperfect therefore the souls of my ancestors ascend to god in wordless adoration
none might exhort or confess or in any way metal with the religious experience of another
among us men were created sons of god and stood erect as conscious of their divinity
that solitary communion with the unseen which was the highest expression of our religious life is partly described in the word ban day literally mysterious feeling which has been variously translated fasting and dreaming
the first th day or religious retreat marked and epoch in the life of the youths which may be compared to that of confirmation or conversion in the christian experience
knowing the gods sets no value upon material things he took within no offerings are sacrifices other than symbolic objects such as paints and tobacco
at the solemn hour of sunrise or sun that he took up his position overlooking the glories of earth and facing the great mystery and there he remained naked erected silent and motionless exposed to the elements and forces of his arming for a night and a day to two days and nights but rarely longer
when he returned to the camp he must remain it a distance until he had again entered the vapor bath and prepared himself for intercourse with his fellows
it was not then hoy from ignorance or improvidence that he failed to establish permanent towns and to developed material civilization
to the untutored sage the concentration of population was the prolific mother of all evils moral no less than physical
in this type of prayer there was no beseeching and favour or help
from the sun as the universal father proceeds the quickening principle in nature and in the patient and fruitful womb of our mother the earths are hidden embrees plants and men
this is the material or physical prayer
nothing of the marvellous cit astonish him as that a beast should speak or the sun standstill
who may condemn his superstition
here is the supreme mystery that is the essence of worship without which there can be no religion and in the presence of this mystery are attitude cannot be very unlight that of the natural philosopher who beholds with aw the divine in all creation
in his own thought he rose superior to them hes corned them even as a lofty spirit absorbed in its stern task rejects the soft beds the luxurious food the pleasure worshipping gallons of the rich neighbor
the historians of the white race admit that the indian was never the first to repudiate his oath
he had neither a national arming or an organized church
her attitude in secret meditations must be such as to instill into the receptive soul of the unborn child the love of the great mystery and the sense of brotherhood with all creation
the ordeal is best met alone where no curious or pitying eyes embarrass her where all nature says to her spirit tis love tis love the fulfilling of life
miss wilde mother has not only the experience of her mother and grandmother in the accepted rules of her people for a guide but she humbly seeks to learn a lesson from ants bees spiders beavers and badgers
in due time the child takes of his own accord the attitude of prayer and speaks reverently of the powers
indeed the distinctive work both grandparents as that of acquainting the youths with the national traditions and beliefs
the family was not only the social unit but also the unit of government
the remoter degrees of kinship or fully recognized and that not as a matter of form ony first cousins were known as brothers and sisters the name of cousin constituted a binding claim and our rigid morality forbade marriage between cousins and amy known degree or another words within the clan
when she fell the whole ray fell with her
before this cam came upon us she could not find anywhere ha your home than that created by the indian woman
his daily devotions were more necessary to him th daily food
whenever in the course of the daily hunt the red hunter comes upon a scene that it strikingly beautiful or sublime a black thunder clouded with the rainbows glowing arch above the mountain a white waterfall in the heart of the green gorge a vast prairie tinge with the blood red of sunset he pauses for an instant in the attitude of worship
when he becomes an old man he lost to make a notable effort to prove his gratitude
he cuts off the choicest moral of the meat and cast it into the fire the purest and most et real element
the hospitality of the wig onand is only limited by the institution of war
our honour is the guarantee for his safety so long as he is within the camp
love between man and woman is founded on the mating instinct and h not free from desire and self seeking
but to have a friend and be true under any in all trials int the mark of a man
this bond is between man and man is usually formed in early youth and can only be broken by death
wean carnation in the converses spirits
therefore he court's death and battle on the other hand he would regarded as disgraceful to be killed in a private quarrel
the men blacken their faces and widows or breathe parents sometimes gash their arms and legs till they are covered with blood
giving themselves up poly to their grief they are no concerned about an eat earthly possession and often give away all that they have to the first comers even to their beds in their home
it was prepared by dressing in the finish clothes together with some personal possessions and ornaments wrapped in several robes and finally in a secure covering of rawhide
as a special mark of respect the body of the young woman or warrior was sometimes light out in state in a new tepee with the usual household articles and even with a dish of food left beside it not that they suppose the spirits could use the implements are eat the food but merely as a last tribute
if a man were slain in battle it was an old custom the place body against a tree or rock in a sitting position always basing the enemy to indicate his undulated defiance and bravery even in death
at every meal time a dish of food was plunder it and some person of the same sex and age as the one who was gone must afterwards be invited in to partake of the food
at the end of a year from the time of death the relatives made a public feast and gave away the clothing and other gifts while the lock of hair was interred with appropriate ceremonies
it is well known that the american indian had somehow developed a co power and although in the latter days there have been many imposts and allowing for the vanity and weakness of human nature it is fair to assume that there must have been some even in the old days yet there are well attested instances of remarkable prophecies an other mystic practice
no doubt many predictions have been colored to suit to new age and unquestionably false prophets fs and conjures had become the pests of the tribes during a transition period
this was carried out to the letter
this was only one of his remarkable prophecies
another famous medicine man was morn on the rum river about one hundred and fifty years ago and lived to be over a century old
at the age of about seventy five years he saved his band from utter destruction into hands of their ancestral enemies by suddenly giving warning received in a dream of the approach of the large war party
five years later he repeated the service and again saved his people from awful slaughter
there are many trustworthy men and men of christian faith to vouch for these in similar events occurring as foretold
at another time when i was fourteen years old re had just left fort ellis on the assent of bone river and my youngest uncle had selected a fine spot for that camped
many amiens believed that one may be borne more than once and there were some h claim to have full knowledge of a former inclination
there was a well known sou war prophet who lived in the middle of the last century so that he is still remembered by the old men of his band
sloe
this was the first big battle in which our regimented ever been engaged
i did not pretend to tell of what command distinguished itself of heroes of blood in wounds of shrieks and groans of brilliant charges of cannon captured et cetera
about daylight on sunday morning chalmers brigade relieved gladdens
as glad and rode by us a courier rut up and told him something
on sunday morning a clear beautiful and still day the order was given for the whole army to advance and to attack immediately
we were supporting and alabama re gade
that's ride my brave first tennessee give him the hail columbia
the fact was kept from the troops
we had the pass over the ground where troops had been fighting all day
i had heard and read of battlefields sin pictures of battle fields of horses a man of cannon and wagons all jumbled together while the ground was strewn with dead and dying and wounded but i must confess that i never realized the pomp and circumstance of the thing called glorious war until i saw this
i had been feeling mean all the morning as if i had stolen a sheep but when they ordered to charge was given i got happy
officers could not curb the men to keep in line
on monday the tide was reversed
but as i said before reader a private soldier is but an automaton and those nothing of what is going on among the generals and i am only giving the chronicles of little things and events that came under my own observation as i saw them then and remember them now
should you desire to find out more about the battle i refer you to history
about the time he pulled trigger a stray ball from some direction struck him in the side and he fell off dead and his horse becoming frightened galloped off dragging him through the confederate lines
a monday morning i too have captured me a mule
it was wise in his own conceit
i free only thought it would be pleasant to split the difference without mule and i would gladly have done so if i could have gotten one half of his no
mule did not desire across while i was trying to persuade him with a big stick a rock in his ear and o twisted on his nose
so he got a large t inch rope tied one and the round the mule's neck on the other to the cass and ordered the driver to whip up
the rope however was stronger than the mules know and he was finally prevailed upon by the strength of of the rope to cross the creek
i'm wh take in the rope off he shook himself and seem to say you think that you are mighty smart folks but you are a little too smart
we remained sever months but so we were on the tramp again
the federal army was concentrating at nashville there was no rest for the weary
our army stopped at murphy's borough
from time to time different regiments were sent forward to do picked duty
the yet picket lines were not a half mile off
i am a vid you know the responsibility resting on me
says he i would not trust aces on his word oath or bonded march i say
i soon found out that he caught side of the relief on the road and was afraid to shoot i quickly made up my mind
my gun was at my feet and one step would get it
i made a quick glance over my shoulder and grabbed my gun
he divined my motive and fired the ball missed its aim
i think we must to kill the good many in the old field because we were firing all the time at the solid line as they advanced upon us
we kept falling back and firing all day and were relieved by another regiment about dark re rejoined our regiment
line of battle was formed on the north bank of stones river on the yankee side
bad generalship i fought it was christmas
the private cood but he was how general you see
i call lieutenant colonel friar son's attention to the yankees and he remarked well i don't knowe whether they are yan he are not but if they are they will come out of they mighty quick
the yank is marched over the hill out of sight
we were ordered forward to the attack
we were right upon the yankee line on the lookers and turn pipe
we were not twenty yards off from the yankees and they were pouring the hot shot and shells rid into our ranks and every man was yelling at the top of his voice seize fire and you are firing on your own man sez firing you were firing on your own men
oakley color bearer of the fourth tennessee regiment ran right up in the midst of the acy line with his colors begging his men to follow
the leaden hale storm swept them off the field they fell back and reformed
we were at that time at least a hundred yards and advance of the brigade cheat him all the time calling upon the men to come on
i saw and felt that he was not fighting for glory but that he was fighting for his country because he loved that country and he was willing to give his life for his country and the success of our cause
i thought it had been torn for my shoulder
as i went back to the field hospital i overtook another man walking along
i looked at at pretty close and i said great god
he was walking along and all at once he dropped down and died without a struggle or a groan
but it could not bear the thought a wearing dead men' shoes
he was stone dead but i dropped at foot quick
before we arrived at the house we saw a body of yankees approaching and as we started to run back they fired upon us
our picket said run in and reported a night attack
advance into tennessee
yank says what are you do in johnny
we passed a rounded la crossed the chat huc and travelled back over the same root on which we had made the arduous campaign under joe johnson
outside of these occasional reminders we could see no evidence of the desolation of the track of an invading army
we saw the united states flag flying from the ramparts and thought the yank would probably be asleep or catching life sir maybe engaged in the game of seven up
he walked up and says hello boys what is it boss
a yankee alla says knocker
they persuaded eloquently
a man in the well
the voice appeared to be overhead
right before me i saw the long dry grass all bending towards a common center and i knew that it was an old well and that my comrade had fallen in it
but how to get him out was the unsolved problem
the poor fellow state in that well all night
we looked all around and thought that the coast was clear
i don't think it gun was lowed though because we did not hear the ball whistle
we walked over this floating bridge and soon found ourselves on the tennessee side of tennessee river
we had beef for supper that night
how every pulse did beat and leap and how every heart did throb with a motions of joy which seemed nearly akin heaven when we receive the glad intelligence of our onward march towards the land of promise and of our loved ones
we were inured to privations and hardships had been upon every march in every battle and every skirmish and every advance and every retreat in every victory and every defeat
he wanted to go by home and tell his wife and children good by and to get his clothes it was no go
but after while jim says gentlemen i gaining b law
you see jim knowed the law
those old soldiers had long long ago forgotten about that old law the long gone past but jem had treasured it up in his memory low these many years and he thought it would ser him now as it had no doubt frequently done in the past
the third day was reported that the yankees had taken position on the murphy's borough pike
a regiment was sent to the attack it was jem's regiment
he hadn't seen anything to shoot out but he blazed away he loaded and fired the second time when they were ordered to retreat
but is laughter a synonym of joy
such perfect completeness is not in nature
had gwynplaine when a child been so worthy of attention that his face had been subjected to transmutation why not
according to all appearance industrious manipulates of children had worked upon his face
it seemed evident that a mysterious and probably a cult science which was to surgery what alchemy was to chemistry had chiseled his flesh evidently at a very tender age and manufactured his countenance with premeditation
gwynplaine was a mountain bank
he showed himself on the platform
it was gwynplaine's lap which created the laughter of others yet he did not laugh himself
the outside did not depend on the interior
no one could escape from this rice
all his emotions whatever they might have been augmented his strange base of joy or to speak more correctly aggravated it
an ever lasting laugh
the moans believed the absolute occasionally gives way and at god himself sometimes apt cates for a time so also of the will
the whole of existence resembles a letter modified in the postscript
with this exception when plains lap was ever lasting
the joyous convulsion of laughter was as a tribute paid they submitted to it gladly but almost mechanically
besides we must remember that they had in those times means of putting patience to sleep and of suppressing all suffering only then it was called magic while now it is called anesthesia
besides this face those who had brought him up had given him the resources of a dimness and an athlete
w plane had yellow hair
his hair having probably been died with some corrosive preparation had left it woolly and rough to the touch
its yellow bristles rather amain than ahead of hair covered and concealed a lofty brow evidently made to contain thought
the operation whatever it had been which had deprived his features of harmony and put all their flesh and t disorder had had no effect on the bony structure of his head
what true things are told in stories
in gwynplaine's evil thoughts never ripened and he had therefore no remorse
what was this nothing
from sixteen eighty to seventeen o four a great change had taken place
the wheels were all of the same size and high as wagon wheels
this green color had succeeded in drawing attention to the carriage which was known in all the fair grounds as the green box
on the roof from a tub painted green like the rest smoke arose
the astonishment with which the villagers regarded this machine was overwhelming
this was the old establishment of ursus its proportions augmented by success and improved from a wretched booth into with theater
unknown people had worked upon his face he on the other hand had worked on his mind and behind this well executed mask he had placed all that he could have thought
the effective his appearance had been surprising
some believed it to be natural others declared it to be artificial an as conjecture was added to reality everywhere at every cross rod on the journey in all the grounds of fairs and fates the crowd ran after gwynplaine
the curiosity of one place exhausted they passed on to another
this fortune had allowed ursus who was the administrator gwynplaine success to have the chariot of his dreams constructed that is to say a caravan large en to carry at theatre and to so science and art in the highways
for these red phoebean venus that we may conform to english pronunciation
phoebe cooked venus grubb the temple
ursus and ho tok charge of each other
this hut in a corner at the back to the right of the door served as bedchamber and dressing room to ursus in gwynplaine
the caravan was divided into three compartments partition from each other
aloft under the arch of the roof contained the scenes and on opening a trap door lamps appeared producing wonders of light
ursus was the poet of these magical representations he wrote the pieces
then i look perhaps like what i am
this opening looked for all the world like a mouth of hell in the words of the itinerant puritan preachers who turned away from it with horror
uses was in everything in the peace in the company in the kitchen in the orchestra
it was established at south work
the dome of saint palls was a delight to ursus
saint paul is a saint only with extenuating circumstances
he entered heaven only by the artist's door
it might have been ordered for the green box
it was a theater ready made
against this wall was placed the green box which they were able to draw into the yard owing to the height of the gate
the placard w plain the laughing man taken from its nail in the green box was hung up close to the sign of the inn
by the side of the door was constructed off hand by means of an empty barrel a box for the money taker who was sometimes phoebe and sometimes venus
we are in london said ursus we must be prepared for the gentry
they began their performances
with that exception there are success became so great that no mount to bank memory could recall its parallel
all south work ran in crowds to admired the laughing man
the merry andrews and mount to banks of tins o field were aghast at gwynplaine
gwynplaine ate up their publick
besides the small fry the swallows of swords and the grimace makers real performances took place on the green
even this comedian of jaws and claws was eclipsed in success
that success was prodigious still it remained local
it took a hundred and thirty years for the name of shakes burt to penetrate from england into france
the glory of gwynplaine had not passed london bridge
these were remarkable talents
besides this he harangued like cicero as we have just seen sold as drugs attended sickness and even healed the sick
ursus was satisfied with the applause of southwark but by no means astonished
at every performance the yard of the inn transformed into a pit was filled with a ragged and enthusiastic audience
the emptying of tankards did not decrease their success
this connoisseur was suddenly fascinated and had adopted the laughing man
he did not come every evening but when he came he led the public applause grew into acclamation success rose not to the roof for there was none but to the clouds for there were plenty of them
which clouds seeing that there was no roof sometimes wept over the masterpiece of ursus
his enthusiasm caused ursus to remark this men and gwynplaine to observe him
they had a great friend in this unknown visitor
one evening ursus was in the side scene which was the kitchen door of the green box seeing master nicholas standing by him showed him this man int a crowd and asked him
what a pity that he should not be a lord
he would make a famous scoundrel
at that hour there was no one in the fair ground except perhaps some reeling drunkard making staggering shadows and dark corners
on the second of the month at two in the morning our precious cargo luggage was taken on board the goods ship fal gary
but in the cause of science men are expected to suffer
well and have we affair wind
my uncle was delighted for myself moody and dissatisfied i appeared almost to expected glimpse of the ghost of hamlet
but not goes or anything else appeared upon the ancient walls
the fact is the castle as much later than the time of the hero prince of denmark
no mister hardwigg said the captain no fear of that
at all events we shall get there some day
on the eleventh day we sighted cape portland over which towered mountain medals yoke which the weather being clear we made out very readily
the vulgar kept off the coast sparing to the westward
on all sides were to be seen whole schools of wales and sharks
nearly the whole population of the town was on foot to see us land
the fact was that scarcely any one of them but expected some goods by the periodical vessel
then without further remark he put his finger to his lips frown darkly and descended into the small boat which awaited us
he was however but a civil servant a magistrate the governor of the island barn tramp
the professor knew whom he had a deal with
this mud scholar spoke no languages safe icelandic and latin
when therefore he addressed himself to me in the language of horace we at once came to understand one another
now harry said my uncle rubbing his hands on' goes well the worst difficulty is now over
in the me time there is not an hour to lose
very likely i may find there some manuscripts from the hand of sak nu some
i shall be glad to consult them
they were now however absent on duty
though not very large it appeared not likely to be filled for centuries
i have got the slightest doubt that in high winds its red tiles were blown out to the great annoyance of the pastor and congregation
thanks to the heat of these residences grass grows in the roof which grasses carefully cut for hay
i saw but few inhabit in stirring my excursion but i met a crowd on the beach drying salting and loading codfish the principal article of exportation
the men appeared robust but heavy fair haired like germans but of pensive mean exiles of a higher scale in the latter of humanity than eskimos but i thought much more unhappy since with superior perceptions they are compelled to live within the limits of the poor circle
i began to enjoy the exhilarating delights of travelling a life of desire gratification and liberty
hans are extraordinary guide went first walking with a steady rapid unvarying step
our two horses with the luggage followed of their own accord without requiring whip or spur
geographers of divided into four parts and we had across the south west quarter which in vaulted suit vest furder
we took our way through poor and sparse meadows which made a desperate effort every year to show a little green
they very rarely succeeded in good show of yellow
i could not help smiling to seem look so big on his little horse his long legs now and then touching the ground made him look like a six footed centre
snow tempest impracticable roads rocks icebergs nothing stops him
we may do so was my reply but what about our worthy guide
i should have a violent attack of the cramp if i were not to have some sort of exercise
my arms are right but my leger getting a little stiff
here and there could be seen an isolated farm some solitary bur or ascent house built of wood earth fragments of lava looking like beggars and the highway of life
a few straight hows and sheep were only seem occasionally
little did i expect however the spectacle which awaited ass when we reached the peninsula of snaffles where a glomeris of nature's ruins form a kind of terrible chaos
it consists simply of a few houses not what in england or germany we should call a hamlet
i took occasion to consult the map to see where garter was to be found
these sacred edifices are however very much like these people who do without watches and never miss them
tito re salt water upon the back of a little horse seemed to me absurd
and any case i shall trust rather to my own intelligence than theirs
but my uncle wasn't no humour to wait
at length the starting little pony spreading out his legs in a stiff and ludicrous attitude got from under the professor's legs and left him standing with both feet on a separate stone like the colossus of roads
he says tied replied my uncle translating the danish word for my information
i thoroughly understood and appreciated the necessity for waiting before crossing the feud for that moment when the sea at its highest point is in a state of slack water
accustomed as i had been to the steam fairy boats of the el i found the long oars of the boatman but sorry means of locomotion
but this power of discernment was denied them and only in after years with the love ones of their own fire sides close about them was the whole picture revealed
one dark night at the head of a score of his tribe he fell upon will bigg alan's camped his object being the abduction of the princess
while the attack was successful in away its main purpose failed
a counter attack was made upon wonga and he was driven deep into the wilderness with great loss
three days later minnetaki became news him's wife at the hudson day post
from that hour dated one of the most sanguinary feuds in the history of the great trading company a feud which as we shall see was destined to live even unto the second generation
meanwhile two children came to bless the happy union of n some and his lovely indian life
the other was a girl three years younger and new some insisted that she be called minnetaki
curiously enough the blood of lobby rein almost pure to his indian forefathers while minnetaki as she became oder developed less of the wild beauty of her mother and more of the softer loveliness of the white race her wealth of soft jet black hair and her great dark eyes contrasting with the lighter skin of her father's blood
wabi on the other hand was an indian in appearance from his moccasins to the crown of his head swore thee sinewy and agile as a lens and with every instinct in him crying for the life of the wild
one of nu son's chief pleasures and life had been the educating of his wooden bride and it was the ambition of both that the little minutia in the ways of white children
consequently both mother and father began their education at the post they were sent to the factor school and two winters were passed in poor arthur that they might have the advantage of thoroughly equipped schools
the children proved themselves unusually bright pupils and by the time wabi was sixteen and minnetaki twelve one would not have known from their manner of speech that indian blood rain in their veins
it was at about this time in their lives that the wounds became especially daring in their depredations
at last so daring did he become that the provincial government placed a price upon his head and upon those of a number of his most notorious followers
but each week added to his loneliness and his longs for metal ki a his forests
necessity had become his grim master and the following week he was doing to work
a thousand plans were made a thousand adventures pictured and the mother with smile and laugh and plan with them
but in time the end of it all came and wile be went back to the princess mother to minnetaki and to his forests
there were tears in the boy's eyes when they parted and the mother cried for the indian boy who was returning to his people
spring came and pass and then summer
we shall make more money up hear the winter than you could earn in detroit and three years
no hunt wolves the country is alive with them and the government gives a bounty of fifteen dollars for every scalp taken
three weeks later came will they go on's reply
on the tenth of october he would meet ride spruce wood on the black sturgeon river
there was little time to lose in making preparations and the fourth day following the receipt of wabi's letter found raw in his mother waiting for the train which was to whirl the boy into his new life
chapter seven the home coming
colonel lait teal that regarded the white flag with feelings in which triumphant sadness were mingled strangely
but the emotions of harry and as comrades were for the moment those of victory only
boats put out both from the f end the shore
the smoke itself which had formed a vast cloud over the harbor forts and city was now drifting out to sea leaving all things e sharply in the dazzling sunlight of a southern spring day
that white flag and those boats going out mean that sumter ours
but the negotiations were soon completed
all the amenities were preserved between the captured garrison and their captors
the great state of virginia mother of presidents went out of the union at last and north carolina tennessee in arkansas followed her but maryland kentucky in missouri still hung in the balance
lincoln had called for volunteers to putt down a rebellion but harry heard everywhere and charleston that the confederacy was now securer
the progress of president davis to the new capital set in the very face of the foe was to be one huge triumph of faith and loyalty
there was not a single note of gloom
europe which must have its cotton which favour the success of the south
an extraordinary wave of a motions swept over the south carrying everybody with it
bor regard at once wrote in order
colonel kenton rites wisely
we need kentucky and i understand that a very little more may bring the state to us go with your father i understand that you have been a brave young soldier here and may you do as well up there
harry feeling pride but not showing it saluted and left the room going at once to madame d lens where he had left his baggage
he intended to leave early in the morning but first he saw his friends and told them good by
har gave his farewells with deep and genuine regret
whether their manner was grave or frivolous he knew that these were good friends of his and he sincerely hoped that he would meet them again
it was a different harry who stir at home late in april
four months had made great changes he bore himself more like a man his manner was much more considered in grave
he had seen great things and he had done his share of them
he gazed upon a world full of responsibilities and perils
but he looked back at charleston the gay the vault on the beautiful with real affection
it was almost buried now and flowers and foliage
he was going home after victory
he soon left charleston out of sight
he felt the difference as soon as he reached the hills of his native state
people were cooler here and they were more prone to look at the two sides of a question
the air too was unlike that of south carolina there was a sharper tang to it
it whipped his blood as it blew down from the slopes and crests
it was afternoon when he reached the little station of winton and left the train a tall sturdy boy the superior of many a man in sighs strength and agility
there were never before such times an old con tacking
bill skull in as gang then mountaineers were up
he did not say the last as a boast but merely evan assurance to the livery man who he saw was anxious on his account
if you've got pistols just you think once before you is shoot said collins
harry thanked him through his saddle bags across the horse a powerful bay and giving a final wave of his hand to the sympathetic liveryman rode away
this was not the fashion of a year ago when they exchanged a friendly word or two but harry knew its cause now nobody could trust anybody else
but he saw nothing that moved there no signal lights twinkled
one winter evening as soon as his work was over for the day josephs locked the door of his smithy washed himself well put on clean clots and taking his violin set out for testbridge mary was expecting him to tea
it was the afternoon of a holiday and she had closed early
was there ever a happier man than joseph that night as he strode along the footpath
he pressed his violin case to his heart as if it were a living thing that could know that he loved it
earth was gone and heaven was all
bless am i hear now my god and bless shall i be there then
when he reached the suburbs the light of homes with shining through curtains of all colors
just then he was a no mood to think of the sorrows
the nettle in the dark said joseph
he was in a mood from music was he not
he laid down his violin and seated himself where mary told him in her father's armed cheer by the fire
letty finding herself not quite equal to the emergency came in her turned to call mary she went as quietly as if she were leaving a tiresome visitor
the music was broken in joseph left alone with the dumb instruments
but in his hands solitude and a violin were sure to marry in music
they sat down and listened in silence
her heart seemed to swell up into her throat and it was all she could do to keep from weeping
a little longer and she was compelled to yield and the silent tears flowed freely
letty too was overcome more than ever she had been by music
let but a mood be strong enough and the soul clothing itself in that mood as with a garment can walk abroad and haunt the world
it cried aloud that eternity was very longed and like a great palace without a quiet room
nor was this exactly the shape the thing took to the consciousness of the musician
i love thee i love thee cried the violin and the worship was entreaty that knew not itself
hast thou yet to learn that the love of the human is love is divine is but a lower form of the part of a love of god
when thou lovest man or woman or child yea or even dog aright then wilt thou no longer need that i tell thee how god and his christ would not be content with each other alone in the glories even of the eternal original love because they could create more love
he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen h shall a love god whom he have not seen
a sobs like a bird new borned burst from mary's bosom
that enchantment had possessed him usurping as it were the throne of his life and displacing it when it ceased he was not his own master
he started to conscious confusion only neither knowing where he was nor what he did
how it happened he never could tell but he brought down as violin with a crash against the piano that then somehow stumbled and all but fell
in the active recovering himself he heard the neck of his instrument part from the body with a tearing discordant cry like the sound of the ruin of a living world
his violin was broken but his being was made whole
his treasure taken type of hisself and a woman given him instead
is dislike him he murmured
you'll all be over if you don't a a care
looks like a cup of bushes down there i ain't sure can you make it out
yes agree to that does look like bushes
don't live around like perfectly still warned the guide are you hurt
and that tumbles enough to knock the sense out of fill grown man
i could not think of allowing any of my chargers to dick so terrible a risk at
no i am the lighter of the two urged hadad
i am the one to go after walt if any one has to i'll go down mister thomas
master te this right decided the guide gazing at the two boys approvingly
i protest shouted the professor
you have bother was at the boom we elected to you to take care of this end
be sure to fast of him securely to the loo before you give the signal to hall up warm the guide
are you ready yes
he too with his head to look up
the bloomin said tis body swaying giddily from side aside and
cautiously placing a hand against the rock this city himself ted wisely concluded that hereafter it would not beg to be too curious
slowly but steadily the slender lying was paid out amid at tens silence on the part of the little group at the top of the canyon
after what seemed to them hours a sharp call from the depths reached their ears
ly quickly make best the line do a tree
i see and call tad his voice sending oll and i natural to those about
he has so far to the right of me that i can't reach him
lodged in the branches of opinion tree i think it is but he doesn't answer me
lige leaning over the brink was able to follow the boy's movements by the aid of the thin ark of light made by the torch in tad's hand
but from the cautious movements of the light far beloved them the guide understood that the lad was at work carrying up his part of the task of rescue to the best of his ability
maybe you think he sey some sort of a pic down there a laredo
shall we haul up asked lish making and bigg of thon of his hands yes hul away
sure saying answered the boy
nor was the sense of security increased when and shipped in his position the torch fell from miss grasp the fagot scatter as they slipped down between the limbs of the tree and whirling in ever dish circles until finally he heard them platter on the walks below
he no doubt would bring food of some kind with him
with a shout the boys dash pale mill to meet the pack train and falling in behind the slow moving boroughs urged them on with the riser shouts and sundry resounding sleeps on the animal's flanks
called water is the most gorham thing we've touch since last night
we did not and must have come to live some time to that i and dug its way out laughed hadad
and we've got a surprise for you and not stacy swelling with pride
jam explained chunky stretching his neck and eyeing the dish longingly
now fall too young gentlemen directed the professor
i afraid to admit that i am hungry to
he buried his biscuit under a layer of jam aver could she spread thick coating of honey
president brown i withdrawn my criticism i offer human humble apologies
i reckon there are smiled the guide we are in the bar country now
yes the cress full of caves
this announce let filled the boys with excitement
but i know it all supper who will witness his dog if it is not out
supper having been finished the party gathered about the cat fire for their evening cheat after which it monism stacy to keep it the distant and not to go borrowing troubled the voice turned in for a sound sleep
as yet they had been unable to a chip any fancy writing with their ponies owing to the rugged nature of the country through which they had been journeying
the boys were nail all anxiety to start while the ponies after their sunday rest were almost as sill of life as were their owners
the little animals were becoming more surefooted everyday and ned said that before the trip as finished jimmy would be able to walk a slack rope
i early struck with bade so that the party reached the promise tableland shortly before tim at lock in the forenoon
a tipperary cap was quickly pitched
the great green filled creed on all sides by tall trees made the place an ideal one for their purpose
it was a beautiful race the little indian pooty sime to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the contest stretching themselves alter their full links and with heads on a level with their backs fairly flew across the great plot of green
all agreed the tad superior horsewhip alone had won the race for him
gallop mid the camp the boy fetched to sombre which he carried well out into the fail and tossed away
then bidding the boys rid up near the spot to watching he drew off some ten rods and wheeling spurs cory to ard
grasping the pummel with the left hand a happier to dive he birched toward the ground
they saw his long hair almost brushed the grass what it his hand swept down in up and once more ted butler rose standing in his strips uttering a cowboy year as he waved as on barrow and high
that bays howled with delight that is all did save tics he brown
tad is an experienced whiter
the first time he rode swiftly by it getting over to look a bad as he passed holding to the pavel firmly with his left head
what sat for demanded needed wonderingly
h it close to be i couldn't get it explained chucking the boys roared
why don't you move the pooty
once more cecy approached the some book his pony running well and as he drew near it they saw him rise in the saddle just as tad but bor had done a few minutes before
if the lil it when he freed his left flic from a stirrup he threw his body sharply to the right reaching for the hat without taking the precaution to grasp the palm
as a result instead of stopping when he reached the hat the boy kept on going
chapter four the first night in camp
even if i can't seeing i can be that
no of the rage why not demanded the boy
aloud laugh followed the chunky's spits
the pony did most of it admitted the land i just gave him his head and that's all there was to it
walter had gone out with a second guard in the others had gathered around the cat fire for their knightly story telling
none be will be fit p duty to morrow
we've got a hard drive before and everye man must be fit this a fiddle
ho guarded curly aims
the can boy did this very thing but within an hour he found himself alone the others having turned in one by one
the lads down that a pair of blankets of u sign to each of them with an ordinary wagged she doubled for a tarling
these they spread out on the ground gazing boots wrapped in coats for pillows
cecy brown proved the only troubler in the lot glaring that he couldn sleep a week on such a bed as that
the horses of the out bit save those that were o night duty and two or three others the had develop a habit of straying had been turned loops early in the evening for animals on the trail or seldom stick them
in spite of their harm couches the pony rider slept soundly even professor seppy in himself never waking the whole night through
sax crumbled turned over and went to sleep again
you won't be so fast to wake up hard working cowboys after that i reckon
mi bey bates came running toward him not daring to call out for fear of waking the camp
ii there his sloppy filled with thinking nation that anyone should attempt to out a pony from the right side
sa cy browns left leg swung over the saddle
where are they asked the boy
keep agoing and if your lucky held run plum into them was the jeering answers the sleepy cow and spurred their ponies on toward camp muttering their disapproval of taking a lock much boys on the cattle drive
almost before the echoes of his voice and died away a shrill a voice piped up from the tail land of the chuck wagon
grow pile grow pile
who is the ranger this morning asked the foreman glancing a out of his men
a rangers a wrangler answered big foot stonily
he said fellow whose all the time making troubles asked spacing innocently
oh no this kind of a wrangler isn't laughed the foreman
he's a troubled cure not a troublemaker makes it for itself
pal to tell the young gentleman what would become of you if you were to serve bad meals to this output of couplings
how asked dead
we had better start the drive this morning
what are fusses made about you my dear little friends
you surely cannot suppose that in a natural state you would be forced to climb regularly up one tall bar stick such as i see you upon now
your cousin the wild convolvulus whom i left in the fields this morning does no such thing i assure you
my young plans require hat or they would not live and the pots we are kept in protects from those cruel wire worms who delight to destroy our roots
why not allow your silver tufts till luxor eat in a natural manner
still the rose tree stood out that there must be some grated bandages in a garden's care for she could not pretend to be ignorant of her own superiority to all her wild relations and the woods
then the wind took another frolic round the garden and made up to the large white lily int whose refined ear he whispered a dow as to the necessity or advantage of her thick powerful stem being propped up against a stupid ugly stick
he really grieved to see it
did that lovely creature supposed that nature who had done so much for her that the fame of her beauty extended throughout the world had yet left her so weak and feeble that she could not support herself in the position most calculated to give her ease and pleasure
indeed not a flower escaped his mischievous suggestions
echoed the flowers tremulously as with a sort of fearful pleasure they awaited his approach
making a sort of eddying circuit round the garden he knocked over the cum bal vel pole tore the strips from the stick that held up the white lily loosed all the carnation flowers from their fastenings broke the rose tree down and leveled the sweet peas to the ground
meanwhile how fared it with the flowers
oh that she were once more climbing up the friendly fur pole
the honeysuckle escaped no better and the carnation was ready to die of vexation had finding that her coveted freedom had leveled her to the dirt
before the day closed the gardener came whistling from his farm work to look over his pretty charges
but for the sight that awaited him he was not prepared at all
weeds meanwhile sprang up and a dreary confusion reigned in the once orderly and brilliant little garden
the mistress had returned and the young lady was with her and hurried at once to her favourite garden
in this position she remained until a gentle hand was laid upon her shoulder
i am not thinking about the garden mamma replied the young girl without lifting up her face we can plant new flowers and tie up even some of these afresh
in those very early times there was a man named du clan and he was the son of prometheus
after jupiter had bound prometheus on mount caucasus and had sent diseases and cares into the world men became very very wicked
these men he said to his mighty company are nothing but a source of trouble

when at last the queen gave birth to a daughter the king was so overjoyed that he gave a great christening feast the like of which had never before been known
one of the young fairies overhearing her and fancying she might work some mischiefs to the little baby we and hid herself behind the hangings in the hall so as to be able to have the last word and undo any harm the old fairy might wish to work
the turn of the old fairy had now come and she declared while her head shook with malice that the princess should pierce her hand with a spindle and die of the wound
it is true i cannot entirely undo what my elder has done
now fifteen years after the princess was born she was with the king and queen at one of their castles and as she was running about by herself she came to a little chamber at the top of a tower and there sad an honest old woman's spinning but she had never heard of the king edict
she had no sooner taken up the spindle then being hasty and careless she pierced her hand with the point of it and fainted away
he knew that she would not awake for a hundreds years
one said it was an enchanted castle another that witches this there but most believe that it was occupied by great ogre which carried thither all the children he could catch and ate them up one at a time for nobody could get at him through the wood
the young prince at these words fell himself on fire
scarcely had he come to the wood when all the trees and thorns which had made such an impenetrable thicket opened on one side in the other to offer in the path
he entered a large fore cord and stood still with amazement and awe
but the faces of the men were rosy and the goblets by them had a few drops of wine left
he entered the guard room there the guards stood drawn up in line with carbines at their shoulders but they were sound asleep
he passed through one apartment after another where were ladies and gentlemen asleep in their chairs are standing
i have waited long for you
they talked for four hours and had not then said half that was in their heads to say
meanwhile all the rest of the people and the castle had been awakened at the same moment as the princess and they were now extremely hungry
the lady in waiting became very impatient and at length announced the princess that they all waited for her
then the prince took the princess by the hand she was dressed in great splendour but he did not hint that she looked as he had seen pictures of his great grandmother look he thought her all the more charming for that
the violins and ho boys played old but excellent pieces of music and after supper to lose no time the grand almoner married the royal lovers and the chapel of the castle
he turned to show them the castle but behold
when she said good night to beamy and went to her chamber over that were the loved parent and friend would fall asleep no more she felt as if she went walking along to her tomb
at the time mary had noted nothing of these things now she saw them all as for the first time in minute detail while slowly she went up the stair and threw the narrowed ways and heard the same wind that raved alike about the new grave and the old house into which latter for all the bales banked against the walls it found many a chink of entrance
when she opened the door of it the bright fire which beany undesired had kindled there startled her the room looked unnatural uncanny because it was cheerful
she stood for a moment on the hearth and in sad dreamy mood listened to the howling swoops of the wind making the house quiver and shake
this was her dream as nearly as she could recall it when she came to herself after waking from it with a cry
she was one of a large company at a house where she had never been before a beautiful house with a large garden behind
it was a summer night and the guests were wandering in and out at will and threw house and garden amid lovely things of all colors and odors
but she knew nobody and wandered alone in the garden oppressed with something she did not understand
at the end of it she was in a place of tombs
she entered and the servants soft plated in silent were busy carrying away the vessels of hospitality and restoring order as if already they prepared for another company on the morrow no one heeded her
she was lost lost utterly with an eternal loss
she knew nothing of the place had nowhere to go now where she wanted to go had not a thought to tell her what questioned to ask if she met a living soul
but living soul there could be none to meet
she had lost him years and years before and now she saw him he was there and she knew him
he came to her side and she gave him no greeting
i know it and there is no waking
the old time was but a thicker dream and this is truer because more shadowy
her only life was that she was lost
shall i pour out my soul into the ear of a mist of fume from my own brain
thus was she borne away captive of her dead neither willing nor unwilling of life and death equally careless
with bac came a pang of intense pain
she herself should have been the poem a lyric in a white gown and green scarf coming to him through the long grass under the blossomed boughs
her hands should have been full of blue bells and she should have held them up to his face and neatly defense as he sprang forward to take her in his arms
you see that she knew exactly how at triste is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and that the cheaper weekly journals
she had to the fool allowed of her reading in her environment the literary sense
and curiously enough she was hardly curious at all about what he might have to say
she only wished for may and the orchards instead of january and the dingy dusty waiting room the plain faced preoccupied travellers the dim desolate weather
the setting of the scene seemed to her all important
it was bitterly cold but the embankment was more romantic than a railway carriage
he had been late he had offered no excuse no explanation
but here the only thing that occurred to her was to stop and look in one of the shops till he should ask her what she was looking at
the keen wind thrust itself even inside the high collar of her jacket
her hands and feet were aching with cold
she would have shared his sorrow and shown herself half wife path angel from heaven in this dark hour
she said how frightfully called is
and yesterday had a letter from her and she seems to expects to think and i thought i had to tell you darling
a shock of unbelievable relief tingled through her sot that was all what was it compared with her fears
what opinion would he form of the purity of her mind the innocence of her soul if an incident like this failed to shock her deeply
following the tingle of relief came a sharp sickening pinch of jealousy and mortification these inspired her
i don't wonder you were afraid to tell me she began you don't love me you've never loved me i wasn't idiot to believe you did
those four true words wounded her more than all the rest
couldn't help it then how can i ever trust yo
do you think i'm not sorry now
no it's only painful for both of us
i didn't think a decent man could do such things she was pulling on her gloves go home and glowed over it all
he stood up suddenly do you mean it
are you really going to throw me over for thing like this
and he strode down between the marble tables and out by the swing door and was a very goods it
at the corner he remembered that he had gone away without pang for the tea and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy that error
he checked the sillam pulse
so he had listed and went to south africa and he never came home covered with metals and glory which was rather his idea to the few simple words of explanation that would have made all straight and repaid her and him for all the past
the last strains of the ill treated ill fated in t maso had died away and after them had died away also the rumbling of the wheels of the murderous barrow organ that had so gaily executed that along with the nine other tunes of its repertory to the admiration of the house mid at the window of the house opposite and the crowing delight of the two babies next door
the young man drew a deep breath of relief and lighted the wax candles in the solid silver candlesticks on his writing table for now the late summer dusk was falling in that organ pleased heaven made fool the measure of the days appointed torture
then there was silence than a sigh and the sound of light moving feet on the gravel
and again he listened with a quiet pleasure
never had any act seemed so impossible
there is a seat in the garden at the side of the house again she hesitated
then she turned towards the quarter indicated and disappeared round the laurel bushes
look here he said this is all nonsense you know you are tired out and there're something wrong what is it
do drink this and then tell me perhaps i can help you
he hurriedly cut cake and pressed it upon her
he had no time to think but he was aware that this was the most exciting adventure that had ever happened to him

her little foot tapped the gravel impatiently
he told me to stay on at the hotel and i did and then one night when i was at the theater my mid a horrid french thing got in paris packed up all my trunks and took all my money and paid the bill and went

i shall lock up all the doors in windows in the house and then i shall give you my latch key and you can let yourself in and stay the night here there is no one in the house
i will catch the night train and bring my mother of to morrow then we will see what can be done

all the same he added irrelevantly you shall have the lath key
you are kind she said for the third time and reached her hand out to him he did not kiss it then only took it in his and felt how small and cold it was then it was taken away
the lady in the guitar certainly passed the night at hill view villa but when his mother very angry and very frightened came up with him it about noon the house looked just as usual and no one was there with the charwoman

he gave discussing up with a slight shrugged of the shoulders
stevie accustomed too about disregarded had got up from the kitchen table currying off his drawing to bed with him
the sheet of paper covered with circles dropped out of his fingers and who remain staring at the old tourist as if rooted suddenly to the spot by his morbid horror and dread of physical pain
his scared eyes blazed with indignation it would hurt terribly his mouth dropped open
comrade oc pen's face twitched with exasperation
i don't say that protested my calls gently
his vision of truth had grown so intense that the sound of a strange voice failed to rout it this time

he looked dubiously at his brother on law but he did not ask him fr information
mister verloc perceived with some surprise that he did not know really what to say to stevie
he stood still in the middle of the parlor and looked into the kitchen in silence
he watched him gesticulating and murmuring in the kitchen
step he proud round the table like thing sighted animal in the cage

through the influence of honorable thomas l hammer he was admitted at west pointing eighteen thirty nine
at this time grant was not taken with war and probably evinced little interest in army tactics
grant acted as mustering officer until being commissioned colonel of the twenty first illinois volunteers he took the field
general hello in speaking of the battles said
indeed if ever a general deserved honor grant had won it he had opened the mississippi navigation and had captured nearly one hundreds thousand prisoners and arms
he was now commander of all the federal forces
the capture of leave was a far more difficulty undertaking
time wore away and on the ninth of april eighteen sixty five grant captured the confederate army under lee thus virtually ending the war

she was indeed a clever bird
she popped into her new house and sat there comfortably peering out through the windows slits with her sharp little eyes
and she saw all the other birds hopping about and twittering helplessly
then all the other birds chirped eagerly yes yes let us ask her to teach us
so in a great company they came fluttering hopping twittering up to the em tree where mother magpie nestled comfortably in her new house
oh wye mother mag pie dear mother meg pie they cried teach us how to build our nests like yours for it is growing night and we are tired and sleepy
the magpie said she would teach them if they would be a patient diligent obedient class of little birds
and where each word perched there it was to build its nest
she began to show them how to weave the bits of things together into nests as they should be made
and some of the birds who were attentive and careful soon saw how it was done and started nice holes for themselves
i've thought that was the way to begin
certainly of course screamed the jackdaw
here wood pigeon said mother bag pie you must pin so sticks through and across chris cross chris cross so
chris cross chris cross so interrupted the woodpigeon

ferdinand meditates over his good fortune
in moments of deep feeling alike sudden bursts of prosperity as in darker hours man must be alone
it requires some self communion to prepare ourselves for good fortune as well as to encounter difficulty and danger and disgrace
this violent and triumphant revolution in his prospects and his fortunes was hardly yet completely comprehended by our friend ferdinand our mine and when he had left a note for the generous mirabel whose slumbers he would not disturb at this early hour even with good news he strolled along up charles street and to the park in one of those wild and joyous reveries in which we brood over coming bliss and create a thousand glorious consequences
fernand felt his freedom as well as his happiness
it was indeed her handwriting
restless with impending joy he sauntered to the bridge and lean over the balustrade gazing on the waters in charmed and charming vacancy
how many incidents how many characters how many feelings flitted over his memory of what sweet and bitter experienced did he not chew the cood
four and twenty hours ago and he deemed himself the most miserable and forlorn of human beans and now all the blessings of the world seemed showered as his feet
the most s gifted individuals in the land emulated each other improving which entertained for him the most sincere affection
he could not flatter himself that he indeed married at such singular blessings and yet with all his faults which with him were but the consequences of his fiery youths fernand had been faithful to henrietta
his constancy to her was now rewarded
as for his friends the future must prove his gratitude to them
it was indeed dancing on her volcano
and now all had ended so happily
was it not all a dream of his own creation while his eye had been fixed in abstraction on that bright and flowing river
he might be enchanted but that was the talisman
in the present unsettled though hopeful state of affairs ferdinand would not go home
in exactly ten minutes it is in the power of every man to free himself from all the tumult of the world the pangs of love the throbs of ambition the ware and ter of play the recrimination boudoir the conspiring club the rattling hell and find himself in a sublime sylvan solitude superior to the cedars of lebanon an inferior only in extent to the chestnut forest of aetolia

grant was only a few miles away but although the commander and chief he knew nothing of the hardest fought battle of the civil war until it was over
my own regiment was in the advance
our brigade was fearfully outnumbered
there were no breast works yet that one little p grade of hamilton's division stood there in the open and repulsed assault after assault
not balaklava nor the almo saw such fiting it was the dull to the death

one daring revel was shot down and bayonet it clear behind the line of company be where he had broken through to seize the flag of my regiment
that night the enemy slipped away leaving hundreds and hundreds of his dead and wounded w the field
with a few lanterns our men then went about and ty to gather up the wounded the dead were left till morning
it was not a question of who was dead or wounded but who was not
fifteen officers of our little half regiment were dead or wounded
i remained awake all night talking with a comrade who shared my blanket with me poor jimmy king
he is survived the war only to be murdered later on a plantation and mississippi
when morning came the firing opened and for all that day the battle raged fiercely at the left and cent her left weet in the worst of it too

i hasten back to the lines
the cloud or rebels we had seen divided itself into three columns
a perfect blaze of close range musketry too mo them down my grass
they lay in heaps of dozens even close up to the works
that night i stood guard under an oak tree on the battlefield among the unburied dead
indeed we of the rank and file had little confidence and grant in those days
rose crans protested it was in vain
it required months a great events to make grant the hero of the army which he afterward became
for some reason the dead at hatchie bridge were not buried
a week after the battle my brother rode by there on a cavalry expedition and made the horrible discovery that hogs were eating up the bodies of our dead heroes that too was war

let me enter i pray you to pass in late under your roof
it's surely a terrible storm outside said the merchants eldest daughter as the wind rattled the tiles of the roof and the rain beaten torrents against the doors and windows
he is old as well as poor she said
if we decide to show mercy to this poor beggar it is not for you to oppose it
but we should not forget our promise to our father cried the youngest daughter
however in spite of all she could say the elder sisters opened the door and admitted the bigger
it is a fearful knight to send away a beggar said the eldest sister wh they were eating
while they were talking the beggar had taken the apples which the girls were to eat for desert and had sprinkled a sleeping powder over them
the two eldest ate their apples but the youngest could not eat that night she threw the apple away
she did not stir and he knew that the sleeping powder had thoroughly done its work
then she heard him go down the stairway and unbolt the heavy doors which led into the store
it was the youngest one who deceived me cried the robber chieftain
perhaps we can outwit her yet cried another
the merchant's daughter at first did not answer but as he kept on calling to her she finally asked him what it was that he wanted
i promise you i will do you no harm
you shall not come int to my father's house
has the charm out to me then said the robber
when she returned his hand was sticking through the whole e door
the cries incursions of the robbers filled the air
they tried in vain to break down the great doors
all my worries about you were foolish
he had little enough to break or bite and once when there was a great famine in the land he could hardly procure even his daly bread and as he lay thinking in his bed one night he sighed and said to his wife what will become of us
how come you feed our children when we have no more than we can eat ourselves
oh you simpleton said she then we must all for die of hunger you had better plain the coffins for us
but she left him no peace till he consented saying ah but i shall miss the poor children
and as soon as their parents had gone to sleep he got up put on his coat and unbarring the back door went out
ah father said hams i am looking at my white cat sitting upon the roof of the house and trying to say good by
but in reality hansel was not looking at a cat but every time he stopped he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path
but her husband felt heavy at heart and thought it were better to share the last crust with the children
early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed and gave them each a s lace of bread which was still smaller than the former piece
we are going into the forest to hugh wood and in the evening when we ready we will come infect you again
hansel thought the roof tasted very nice and so he tore off a great peace while gretel broke a large round pain out of the window and sat down quite contentedly
come in and stop with me and no harm shall come to you and so saying she took them both by the hand and led them into her cottage
the old woman behaved very kindly to them but in reality she was a bick at old witch who waylaid children and built the bread house in order to entice them in but it soon as they were in her power she killed them cooked them innate them and made a great festival of the day
then she took up hansel with her rough hand and shut him up in a little cage with a lat door and although he screamed loudly it was of no use
gretel began to cry but it was all useless for the old witch made her do as she wanted
ble she cried in a passion get some water quickly they handsome fat or lean this morning i will kill and cook him
dear good god help us now she prayed
creep in said the witch and see if it is hot enough and then we will put in the bread but she intended when gretel got in to shut up the oven and let her bake so that she might eat her as well as hansel
see i could even get in myself
and she got up and put her head into the oven
and now as there was nothing to fear they went back to the witch's house where an every corner were caskets full of pearls and precious stones
then they began to run and rushing into the house they fell upon their father's neck
not having heard from captain benny dick for some little time randal thought it desirable in sidney's interest to make inquiries at his club
the sailing master announced that he had orders to take the vessel back to her port with no other explanation than that the crews was over
this alternative in the captain's plans terminating the voyage a month earlier than his arrangements had contemplated puzzled randal
randal waited while in london on the chance that bennydeck might pay him a visit
he is staying at this hotel to try the air of sidon e and he finds that agrees with him
had her beauty fascinated him
ranal wrote to accept the invitation determining to present himself before the appointed hour and to question catherine privately without giving her the advantage over him of preparing herself for the interview
after months of separation he received a visit from herbert
you distressed me herbert more than words can say
he drank the wine greedily
whatever reviving effect it might otherwise have produced on him it made no change in the threatening gloom of his manner
he put down the empty glass taking no notice of his brother's question
randal he said you know where sydney is
i will do neither the one nor the other
you don't know what it is to be used to seeing a pretty creature always nicely dressed always about the room thinking so much of you and so little of herself and then to be left alone as i am left out in the dark
i'm alone do you hear that alone
i have encourage enough to do it for myself
oh why did i engage that governess
i'm afraid he said
i tried it yesterday it set my brains on fire i'm feeling that glass i took just now
he paulus and put his hand to his fever head
was his mind wandering into some other train of thoughts
you can't do it
let me hear what it is first
i feel for you he hard he said warmly
she shall have your message all that i can do to persuade her shall be done
let me rest a little he pleaded if i'm not in the way
he mentioned the name of one of the old servants set mount moran who had attached himself to randal after the break up of the family
on the next day but one randal arranged his departure for sym so as to arrive at the hotel an hour before the time appointed for the dinner
the new number of a popular weekly journal had that day been published randal bought it
after reading one or two of the political articles he arrived at the columns specially devoted to fashionable intelligence
randall looked again at the first words in the paragraph
with his own suspicions steadily contradicting him he arrived at the hotel obstinately believing that the charming widow would prove to be a stranger
missus norman and her little daughter were out driving with a friend and were expected to return in good time for dinner
missus presty was at home she was reported to be in the garden of the hotel
how nice of you to come so soon she began
she added looking at him suspiciously
but you ought to have known that we are only half an hour behind you out sidon them in the matter of news
the report is premature my good friend
but if these newspaper people waited to find out whether report is truer false how much gossip would society get in its favourite newspapers
you are to understand that catherine is a widow
sit down said missus presty
y shall hear how my divorce daughter and my poor little grandchild were treated at sandy seal after you left us
you would have seen her pining for the company of other children and would have had no mercy on her
he was introduced to missus norman and to missus norman's little girl and we were all charmed with him
when he and i happened if he left together he naturally wondered after having seen the beautiful wife where the lucky husband might be
and the captain of course concluded after having been introduced to kitty that missus norman was a widow
w stories have been printed i do assure you where a stories have been printed
before i consented to answer the child's inquiries i came to an understanding with her mother
honestly
after that i had her mother's authority for telling kitty that she would never see her father again
she asked directly of her father was dead
that will do missus presty your defenses thoroughly worthy of your conduct in all other respects
randal pass this over without notice
a very wise decision she remarked
have you any message for captain bennydeck
not at the hotel just now
it was a relief to randal in the present state of catherine's relations towards benedict to return to london without having seen his friend
good bye dear randal
arrived at the station randal found that he must wait for the train
while he was walking up and down the platform with a mind doubly distressed by anxiety about his brother and anxiety about sydney the train from london came in
what are you doing here he asked
you have been to the hotel he burst out you have seen catherine
we have both seen the same newspaper of course and you have been the first to clear the thing up that's it isn't it
not satisfied with gossip in private the greedy public appetite devours gossip in print and wants more of it than any one editor can supply
supposing the report had been true
in the meantime after what missus presty had confessed the cruel falsehood which had checked poor kitty's natural inquiries raised an insuperable obstacle to a meeting between father and child
he had promised to do his best towards persuading catherine to grant sydney and interview
even the chance of successfully confiding her to benny dee's protection had lost something of its fair promise since randal's visit to side them
be the results however what they might randal could see but one plain course before him now
considerations of delicacy seemed to forbid taking this liberty even with an intimate friend
what happy or future could await her especially she justified randal's pest experience of all that was candid and truthful in her characters then to become his friend's wife
shall i say that she may expectant early visit from you when i see her to morrow
he added sidney's address in a postscript and despatched his letter that evening
but it might perhaps be excusable to infer that the marriage had not yet been decided on and that the captain's proposals were still waiting for catherine's reply
go do you hear
but u mess th five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seems centered in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throats swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry
and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speak a cry frightful in its silence
devon rushed towards the old man and made him in hale powerful restorative
davy unable to bear the side of this touching emotion turned away and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man
for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and prays
what do you mean sir
oh you rave sir exclaimed villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken i rave
do you know the assassin asked morrel
noirtier looked upon morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made valentine happy and thus fixed his attention
said morrel sadly yes replied mater
the old land's eyes remained fixed on the door
as well yes
must i leave alone no
but can he understand you yes
gentlemen he set in the horse voice give me your word of honour that this horrible secret shall f ever remain buried amongst ourselves the two men drew back
my father has revealed the culprit's name my father thirst for revenge as much as you do yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this secret do you not father
morrel suffered and exclamation of horror and surprised to escape him
the old man made assign in the affirmative
it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of flier whose tears silently rolled on his cheeks
but he stopped in the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone
mater was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips
the nearest said the district doctor is a cood italian albay who lives next door to you shall i call on him as a pass
govern said villefort be so kind i was seat you as to accompany this gentleman here is the key of the door so that you can go in an out as you please you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my child's room do you wish to see him
i only wish to be alone you will excuse me will you not
i am going sir and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine
but with full ravishment the hours of prime singing received they in the midst of leaves that ever bore a burden to their rhymes
all waters that on earth most limpet are would seem to have within themselves some mixture compared with that which nothing doth conceal
thou makest me remember where and what procyta that moment was when lost her mother her and she herself the spring
i do not think there shown so great a light under the lids of venus when transfixed by her own son beyond his usual custom
yee are new comers and because i smile began she peradventure in this place elected to human nature for its nest
some apprehension keeps you marvelling but the p sal delicacy giveth light which has the power to unclouded your intellect
the good supreme soul in itself delighting created man good and this goodly place gave him as handsome of eternal peace
by his default short while he sojourned here by his default to weeping and to toil he changed his innocent laughter and sweet play
this every other savor does transcend and notwithstanding slaked so far may be thy thirst that i reveal to thee no more
between her steps and mine were not a hundreds when equally the margins gave a turn in such a way that to the east ey faced
nor even thus away continued far before the lady hoy turned herself unto me saying brother look and listen
now helicon must needs pour forth for me and with her choir geranium must assist me to put inverse things difficulty to think
then back i turned to my face to those high things which moved themselves towards us so sedately they had been distance by new wedded brides
and i beheld the flame lets onward go leaving behind themselves the air depicted and they of trailing pennons had the semblance so that it overhead remained distinct with sevenfold lists all of them of the colors whence the sun's bow is made and delia girdle
these standards to the rearward longer wor th was my sight and as it seemed to me ten paces where the outermost apart
the interval between these four contained a chariot triumphal on two wheels which by a griffin's neck came drawn along
not only rome with no such splendid car air gladdened africanus or augustus but poor to it that of the sun would be
three maidens at the right wheel in a circle came onward dancing one so very red that in the fire she hardly had been noted
the second was as if her flesh and bones had all been fashioned out of emerald the third appeared as snow but newly fallen
in rear of all the group here treated of two old men i beheld unlike in habit but like in gate each dignified and grave
and when the car was opposite to me thunder was heard and all that folk august seemed to have further progress inter died
and one of them as if by heaven commissioned singing vy sponsor dai bono shouted three times and all the others after
as soon as on my vision smote the power sublime that had already pierced me through air for my boyhood i had yet come forth
to the left hand i turned with that reliance with which the little child runs to his mother when he has fear or when he is afflicted
to say unto virgilius not a draw hum of bloods remains of me that does not tremble i know the traces of the ancient flame
dante because virgilius has departed do not weep yet do not weep yet a while for by another's sword thou needs must weep
i saw the lady who ere while appeared veiled underneath the angelic festival directed her eyes to me across the river
look at me well in sooth im beatrice
yee keep your watch in the eternal day so that nor night nor sleep conan steal from you one step the ages make upon their path
therefore my answer is with greater care that he may hear me whose weeping yonder so that the sin and dle be of one measure
but by the large yes of celestial graces which have such lofty vapors for their reign that near to them our sight approaches not
as soon as ever of my second d age i was upon the threshold and changed life himself from me he took and gave to others
so low he fell that all appliances for his salvation were already short saved showing him the people of perdition
confusion and d may together mingled forced such a yes from out my mouth that sight was needful to the understanding of it
whence she to me in those desires of min which led thee to the loving of that good beyond which there is nothing to aspire to
and what allurements or what vantage is upon the forehead of the others showed that thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them
he translated at an early age chiefly between eighteen forty five in eighteen forty nine a great number of poems by the italians contemporary with dante or preceding him and among other things he made aversion of the whole vanua prose and verse
this book in its original form was received with favor and settled the claim of rosy to rank as a poet translator or indeed as a poet and his own right
the life blood of rhythmical translation is this commandment that a good poem shall not be turned into bat one
the only true motive for putting poetry into a fresh language must be to endow of fresh nation as far as possible with one more possessions of beauty
poetry not being in exact science literality of rendering is altogether secondary to this chief law
often would he avail himself of any special grace of his own idiom and epoch if only his will belonged to him often would some cadence serve him but for his author structure some structure but for his author's cadence often the beautiful turn of a stanza must be weakened to adopt some rhine which will tally and he sez the poet reveling in abundance of language where himself as scanty supplied
and if you have time it would be a great service to translate the analyses of the poem which i omitted
on january twenty fifth he wrote many a many thanks for a most essential service most thoroughly performed
my notes which you have taken the trouble revising are of course quite paltry and useless
it is therefore and on all accounts unnecessary to say much more of the work here than it says for itself
throughout the vat on wallah there is a strain like the first falling murmur which reaches the ear and some remote meadow and prepares us to look upon the sea
a word should be said here of the title of dantes oo biography
this has induce some editors of the vun wamba to explain the title as meaning early life
thereafter this sonnet bread and me desire to write down inverse for other things touching my condition the witch things it seemed to me that i had not yet made manifest
which thing being thus there came a day when certain ladies to whom it was well known they hadn't been with me at diverse times in my trouble's together for the pleasure of gentle company
but when i still spake not one of them who before have been talking with another addressed me by my name saying to what and lovest vow this lady seeing that thou canst not support her presence
and now that it hath pleased her to th i this love my master of his great goodness hath placed all m be attitude there where my hope will not fail me
then those ladies began to talk closely together and as i have seen snow fall among the rain so was their talk mingled with size
and i declare that when i speak thereof love sh such perfect sweetness over me that if my courage failed not certainly to him my listeners must be all resigned
whatever her sweet eyes are turned upon spirits of love to issue then some flame which through their eyes who then may look on them pierce to the hard steep chamber everyone
to her i went along in whose much strength my weakness is made strong
so to the road thou shalt be reconciled and find the lady and with the lady love
the second begins here an angel the third here dear song i know
the first part is divided into four
in the third i say what it is i purpose to speaks so as not to be impeded by faint heartedness
and the fourth repeating to whom my purpose speaking i tell the reason why i speak to them
in the second i tell what is understood of her on earth here my ladies desired
the second part is divided into two four and the first i speak of her as regarded the nobleness of her soul relating some of her virtues proceeding from her soul in the second i speak of her as regards the nobleness of her body near eating some of her beauties here love saith concerning her
this second part is divided into two for in the one i speak of the eyes which are the beginning of love in the second i speak of the mouth which is the under love
and at the first it seemed to me that i saw certain faces of women with their hair loosened which caught out to me thou shalt surely die after the witch are their terrible and unknown appearances said unto me thou art dead
and so strong was my fancy that i wept again and very truth and said with my true voice o excellent soul how blessed as he that now look at the pon bey
whereby other ladies who were about the room be coming aware of my discomfort by reason of the moan that she made who indeed was of my very near kindreds led her away from where i was and then set themselves to awaken me thinking that i dreamed and saying sleep a longer and be not disquieted
when being aroused i opened mine eyes and knew that it had been a deception
in my hue was such that they looked at each other and thought of death saying under their breath most tenderly o let us comfort him then unto me what dream was thine that it hath shaken me so much
and therewithal such a bewilderment possessed me that i shut mine eye for peace and in my brain did cease order of thought and every helpful thing
then saw i many broken hinted sights in the uncertain state i stepped into
these wilding fancies then carried me to see my lady dead
the second part begins here i was a thinking the first parti abides into two
this lady's right name was jan but because of her comeliness or at least it was so imagined she was called of many but he ma via spring and went by that name among them
and in his speech he laughed and laud again then while it was his pleasure remain i chanced to look the way he had drawn near and saw the ladies jan and beatrice approach me this the other following one and a second marvel instantly
the second part begins here saying be now the third here then while it was his pleasure
he lives thy loss he dies from every limb mangled by thee lightnings of godhead shine from which thy darkness hath not where to hide
quench and paras toper
and flesh was raiment it how he was killed and buried from the dead how he arose to life with victory and reigned in heaven how all of us shall be glorious like him whose hearts to his our wed how they who die for love of reason give hypocrites tyrants softest all who sell their neighbours ill for holiness to hell how the dead saint condemns the bad who live how all he does becomes law for men how he at last to judge shall come again
the s world's thick vapours well your eyes unworthy of that glorious show blind his splendor bent upon his shame
money is false and light unless it be bought by a man's own worthy qualities in blood is such that its corrupt disease an ignorant pretense are foul to see
but pop ly on bestia
the people is a beast of muy brain that knows nodded own force and therefore stands loaded with wood and stone the powerless hands of a mere child guide it with bit and rain one kick would be enough to break the chain but the beast fears and what the child demands it does nor its own terror understands confused and stupefied by bug bea's vain
most wonderful
that penance half new blame which magdalen found sweet purging our shame self punishment is virtue al men know
organ of rut not reason is the lord who from the body politic doth drain lost for himself instead of toil and pain leaving us leans crickets on dry sward
well too with he like love would pilch oar horde with pleasure to ourselves slicing our vain and vigour to perpetuate the strain of a life thy s filth of life within a stored
heaven help that body which a little mind housed in ahead lacking ears tongue eyes in senseless but for smell can tyrannize
due to thee their praise of maiden pure of teeming motherhood
