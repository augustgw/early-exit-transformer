he decided to right her care of the wes side post office and ask for an explanations as well as to have her meet him

preface to the second edition
this is a mistake l perfectly natural one
on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last advises to the printer
then i had much pleasure in reading it but was indeed surprised that the many little points of similarity between two books in spite of their entire independence to one anthers
i regret that reveals have in some cases b inclined to treat the chapters of machines as in attempt to reduce mister darwins theory to an absurdity
i am surprised however that the book at which such an example of the specious missus of analogy would seem most naturally leveled should have occurred to no re youre neither shall i mention the name the poore though i should fancy that the hint given suffice
but this hand effective which i have little reason to complain for i was allowed almost to called them life long self to see hers to their faces and they said it was quite true but that it did not matter
i must notin clud without expressing my must sincere thanks to my critics to the public for the lani sey and considerations with which they a treated my ventures
it was written in the upper rags a district of the canary province as it then was a new zealand at appeared christ church in the press news paper je thirteenth eighteen sixty three
i also rod about this time the substance of what ultimately he came the musical banks and the trial of a man for being in a consumption
i see for my second preface that i took the book to monsieur's chapman and hall may first eighteen seventy one and on their rejection of it under the advice of one who is attained the highest drank among living writers i let it sleep till i took its mister trubner early in eighteen seventy too
i ti its u looked for success meanly to too early favourable reviews the first in the palm ges of april twelfth and the second in spectator apt twentieth
there was also another cause
the first addition of iran solan about three weeks i had not taken molds and as the demand was strong it was set up a get immediately th
i made a few further very trifling alterations before m to were taken but since the summer of eighteen seventy too as ne aits were from time to time wanted they have been printed forster was that made
i have still fairly well satisfied with those p of ear that were repeatedly re written but from those that had only single writing i would gladly cut out some forty of fifty pages if i could
this however may at the for the copy rate will probably expire and a little over twelve years
if the reader will excuse me i will say nothing of my antecedence nor of the circumstances which led me to leave mat of country the nit it would be tedious to him and painful to myself
it will be seen that i did not succeeded my design and that however much i may have met with that was new and strange i have been unable tore any pecuniary advantage
no one he who is himself honest will doubt my being so
i reached my destinations and one of the last months of eighteen sixty eight but i dare not mention the season lust the reader should gathering which tis fere i was
she than catt introduced and bad with extreme rapidity men took up their fifty thousand or on hundred thousand acres of country going inland one behind the other till in a few years there was not an acre between the sea and the f ranges which was not taken up and stations either for shep cattle were spotted about intervals of some twenty or thirty miles over the whole country
i was delighted with the country and the manner of life
i was to see the sheep not necessarily close at hand or to get them in a single mob but to see enough them here and there to feel easy that nothing had gone wrong this was no difficult matter for there were not av hundred of them and being all breathing us they were pre quiet
there were good many shep which i knew as two or three blacks and blacke lamb or too and several others which had some distinguishing mark where by i could tell them
it is surprising how soon the eye becomes the customs to missing twenty sheep out of t three hundreds
it was a monotonous life that it was very healthy and one does not much mind anything when one as well
the country was the grandest that can be imagined
so lonely and so solemn with the sad grat clouds above and no sound save lost lamb leading upon the mountainside as there was little hart were breaking
each must cy louder and wer father yett may lu be with them both that they may find their own at nightfall
i had no money but if i could only finde workable country i might stocky it with borrowed capital and consider myself a mid man
there was no one in the whole world who where the smilest idea save those who were themselves on the other side of it if indeed there was anyone at all could i hoped cross it
i would try the near arrange and see how far i c ago
shortly after passing one of these chapels we came suddenly upon a village would started up out of the mist and i was alarmed less i should be made an objective curiosity or dislike
my guides however were well known and the natural politeness of the people proved them from puy meed to any inconvenience but they could not helping me nor e i them
the streets were narrow an unh but very fairly clean
the vine grades many of the houses and there were some with sign boards on which was painted a bole and the glass that made me fee much at home
even on sledge of human society there a stunted growth of shops which taken r vegetative somehow though in an air herc andante of the blest
each feature was finished el lids e lashes and ears being almost invariably perfected
their expressional was divine and as they glanced in e timidly but with parted lips and great bewilderment i forgot all thoughts of their conversion and feelings that were far more earthly
even a middle agly were still comely and the old great here women at their cage doors had a dignity notes majesty of their own
the mens handsome as the women beautiful
i have always delighted in and reverenced beauty but i felt simply o abashed in the presence of such a splendid type a compound of all that his bestest in egyptian greek in italian
the children or infinite in number and exceedingly mary i need hardly so that they came in for their fu shire of the prevailing beauty
i expressed by signs my admiration and i pleasure my guides and they were greatly pleased
the country was highly cultivated every ledge you being planted with chestnuts walnuts and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering
i saw a few sheep would rounded noses and enormous tiles
in about four hours of walking from from the time we started and after passing two or three more villages we came upon a considerable town and my guides made many times to make the understand something but i gathered no angling of their meaning excepted that i needed the under no apprehension of danger
sufficed that i found myself take him before the chief magistrate and by his orders was placed in an apartment with two other people who were the first i had see looking anything but l handsome
in fact one of them was plainly veryain much out of health and copped violently from from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppressed
the other look pale and ill but he was marvellously self contained and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him
they felt my pulse l looked to my tongue they list that my chest they felt all my muscles and at the out of each operations they looked at the cheap nodded and s som the ina quite pleasant as though i were all right
but by a my they came to myer watch which id hid away in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search
i can there was a very carriage whose wheels in spite a rust decay i could see had been design originally for iron rails
we passed many cases and at last came no one in which there were several clocks two or three old watches
the dese was diffrent but the thing was clearly the same
had some effecting calming him
he began presently to relent and spoke to me in a kinder manner
imagine there were several kinds of old fashion christmases but could hardly be worse than at chid my chambers or horror of horrors at the clubs or my cousin lucy's notions of what she calls the festive season
festive yes
the reply was written in a spelling feminine hand it was a little vague
it appeared that the terms would be five gees but there was an no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover
no whole thing was a trip lad
there was nothing set about the sort of a comminations which would be provided nothing ab a kind of establishment which was maintained or the tablet which was kept
now it is a remarkable thing that i have always had an extraordinary predilections for the ne mag i d do not know w
i have never known a madge and yett for from my boyhood upward i have desired to meet one
under such circumstances shee was hardly likely to be lily herself but her name was m and it was the accident of her christian name which decided me to go
i had no allusions
i did not expected princely entertainment
all night it had been blowing and raining
i felt quite lily myself as i mingled with the christmas crowd looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous
i even bought something forage are i mean missus wilson
it was a horrible journey
he was impervious to reason
it is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that i made at warm for the officials however cold i might have been myself
when at last i reached croft in my journeys end who turned up at the stations staff consisted of a half wed individual who was stationed master porter and clerk combined and a hoping lad who did whatever else there was to do
no one had come to meet me the village was but half mile and hanger dean that the house for which my steps were bent about four miles by the road how far it was across clouded fields my informant did not mentioned
there was a trap at the boy and blunderbuss but that required fetch
when the trap did appear it looked to me uncommonly like an opened spring cart
in it i was deposited with my luggage
i did not know what he meant
i did not ask i was beyond it
i was chill to the bon wet tired hungry
i had long been wishing an old fashion christmas had been completely extinct before i had thought of adventuring and quest of one
he we be that might be so
there be the door and front of you y go up thy steps if you can find him
there's a knocker if none of them haven twisted it off
they pared to be no knocker though whether it had been twisted off was more than i could say
no answer th i allowed a more than decent interval
bettering again suggested the driver hard
maybe there up toed some of their games and once rousing
the bell reverberated through what seem like an empty house
presently feet were heard advancing longed the passage several pairs it seemed and i light gleaming through the window over the door
a voice inquired whose there
the informations was greeted with what sounded on commonly like a corse of laughter
there was a rush of retreating feet and expostulating voice th darkness again and silence
who lives on the people mad
i told the belle again
after a vast am of unfastening the door was opened and on that threshold there stood a girl with a light it candle in her hand
i mister christ of her from london
we lost the key of the cellar and theres nothing out except water and i don't think you'd care for that
her fathers a most remarkable person to say the least
but it is quite plaint to me that all the arrangements from for my wedding are going to be made by the snows
i d do not know when it is going to be but it will be either next week for the week after certainly at the earls possible moment and i shouldn't be at all surprised learn that all mary ends things have been already bought and perhaps some of the marked
it is most delightful
it might just as well be someone else is wedding so u important is the part which i am s to play in it
p instance look at there behaviour in the matter of the ring
the accident in questioned occurred upon the sunday evening
the girls fading but youd don't seem to notice it
i gasped positively guessed
thats it on your accounted
from a cousin of ours whose in that line
i nevers saw a people like the snelling for possessing relatives in allsorts of lines
i was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a profit out of mars anden casement ring but i handed over the amount
it is from her actions in that matter that my suspicion springs
there she's a cottage or it may be a pins di for all io
whence she heard of my engagement with mary anne she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honey moon in her cottage or pig sty and that i should pay her rent fort it
there were no signs of faltering about her flow of language
i found that is a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations
it turned out that she had a little money of her own ab a hundred thirty pounds a year
and of course i had my expectations and she had hers
it was plain that together we should manage most comfortably delightfully in fact
i shall make papa give me five hundred pounds at least
a bird in the handes worth tow in a bush and it will be something to have bous
i know what mamma can af fort to give i will sae ifs she gives it
and i will see that there is no shirking about the boys or about the girl's either
i have drown up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present and i shall tell them what they ought to give it won't be my ful di i don't yet it
of course there are some people with whom you can't be perfectly plain but i shall be as plain as i can there's away and a manner of doing that kind offing
hers has been prodigies
she has a neck of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she once which is a little short of miraculous
i notice that they are generally persons who have already tendered their offerings
the fact of having given mary ana wing present seems to fill them with a feeling of ran chorus a city which to me is inexplicable
such as the selfishness of human nature
but why and that accounts they should pity me i ought together fail too understand
we have allan giving mar presence and i suppose you mister widing have been giving her something too
that was what missus ma fierce and said to me only the other day
and what inquired missus ma parson has marian given you her love
someone one sniggered
i canna pretend explain wh except on the suppositions that romances dead it least in that circle of society in which the snelling s move
as it is unless i a mistaken some of the rending will be on o side and they know it
pus the cards are for the wedding
where going for a honey mo to eerily and the south of france
a second cousin of mary ends is in the cooks toss line
he has given us free passes all the way to the end of our journey and all the way back again and coo pons for freeboard and lodging at the hotel it's wedding present
b sides which we can always se the pops and railway passes which we don't use
he was young no spear had touched him no poison lurked in his wine
i tell you it is not poison she ceded
since his birth he hasp been guarded so closely that the clever as poisoners of the east could not reach him
as you will know there are ten men and ten women who so duty is to taste his food and wine and fifty armed warriors gard his chamber as they guarded now
a l confused mong wain
the man shrugged his bad shoulders and turned back into the arabas chamber
this man was clad in browne camel here roll and sandals and a green turbine was on his head
not until the heavens were in the proper order could they performed this necromancer
with a long stain finger nail he m the constellations on the marble til floor
the slant of the moon pressed evil for the king of via the stars are inter moil the serpent in the house of the elephant
point of contact inquired the other
all discarded portions of the human body still remain part of it attached to it by intangible connections
but at the urgent entreaty of the princes of colza who loved bu a chant vy he gave her a lock of his longed black hair as a token of remembrance
by which a soul is drawn from its body and across gulfs of echoing space returned the man on the mat
on the days under the golden the king ceded out again wat by awful proces us
they see to snap the silver cord that bes me too my dying body
the cluster around me their hands are twen their eyes are red like flame burning in darkness
the fingers ser me like fire
i know now but brings me too the p
there they strove to break the silver cord of life and thrust my soul into the body of a f naw their sorcery summed up from hell ahhh
your cry and the group of your fingers bought me back but i am going fast
there was the old imperious not in his favoring whisper
you i have never disobey me o p my last command
se my soul creams
they also found a martian caller the year had been divided into ten more less equal months and one of them had been dah
ble chamber as lodges hevening going deeper and deeper into the old sea bottom of cars
that took the centre of interest away from archology and started a new burst of activity
the civilian specialist in other fields and the space force people who had have been holding tape lines and making sketches and snapping camers were all flying to lower curtis to find out at home much ox gen there was and what kind of life supported
they had four five species of what might loosely be called birds and something that could easily be classed as a reptile and a cius mane the size of a cat with bird like claws and a herb o almost identical with the pig like thing in the big dar hole amir and another like a dese with a single horn in the middle of its forehead
the daily news cast from from terror showed a corresponding shift in interest at home
toadies found the motions
it was locked for from inside and we hit burn it down with the torch that's where they are
gloria standish who had dropped in for lunch was on the maas fairly screaming into a radial f extension doesn't i of them
well of course their dead what i questioned
martha remembered the clots door on the first survey they hadn't attempted opening it
now it was burned away at both sides and way still hot along the edges on the floor of the big office room in front
a flood bight was on in the room inside and lad was going around looking at things while the space force officer stood by the door
mass su aside thats what it was nice whats in the corners
yes charcoal
so they just came in here and l the charcoal and sat drinking together till they all fell asleep
the terry public wed here about martians and if live martians couldn be found a roomful of dead ones was the next best thing
tolly latimer the discover was beginning to cash on his attentions to gloria and his engi with s he was always either making voice and image talks were tell cast or listening to the news from from the home planet
without questioned he had become overnight the most widely known archologist in history
not that im interested in all for myself he disclaimed afterdeck from terror two days after his discovery
bring it to the public attention dramatis it
so i believe i shall go back at these four a while and' see what i can do

an instant later it crashed over pining mark favour beneath it

for minutes no one stirred among the wreckage
then tom who had been stoned by some falling de breezed himself to a sitting position
tom's eyes focus in horror on the their wreckage in vel by stilled billowing dust
the sky was visible through several gaping halles in the roof which was sagging dangerously on it supporting tresses
the young in enter had just noticed his friend lying pin beneath the heavy beam nearby
his friend's e lids flickered
we'd better not tried him mob him tom decided will get an ambulance
they picked their way through the regis and emerged on a scene of frightful destruction
let see about getting help for mister favour
and the only truck we had available was in that burning shed the superintendent added bitterly
anyhow we want to help got a job force
within minutes tome was in charge of clearing away rubble and extricating any one who might be trapped inside the buildings
the telephone line was soon repaired and a steady stream of rescue vehicles began arriving from harness fire trucks three ambulances and private cars riven by volunteers
the two girls were as much have said as tom's mothers tom laughed
misters swift came into the living room jest then and told tom how worried missus swift and sandy had been
he smiled guiltily as he added but im must mit i was more than a little concerned myself

then the shinning of the wet leaves is delightful and the steamy fragrance and a burst of budd song from a multitude of thrushes and finches and warblers that have nests in the chaparral
a thousand thousand voices are heard but so finally blended they seem a pork of the nighted itself and make a deeper silence

when at last the queen gave birth to a daughter the king was so overjoyed that he gave a great christening feast like of which had never before ben known
one of the young fairies overhearing her and fancying she might works some mischiefs the little baby went and hin herself behinde the hangings in the hall so as to be able to have the last word and und any harm the old fairy might wish to work
the turn of the old fairy had now come and she declared while her head shook with malice but the princess should pearce her hand with a spindle and die of the wound
it is true i cannot entirely und what my elder has done
now fifteen years after the princess was borne she was with the king and queen at one of their castles and as she was running about by herself she came to a little chamber at the top of the tower and there sad and honest old woman spinning but she had never heard as the king z eat it
she had no sooner taken up the spindle then being hasty and careless she pierced her hand with the po of it and fainted away
he knew that she would not awake for a hundred years
one said it was an enchanted castle another that w is this there but most believe that it was occupied by great ogre which carried thither all the children he could catch and eight them upo one of a time for nobody could get at him through the wood
the young prince at these words fell himself on fire
scarce m had he come to the wood when all the trees and thorns which had made such an im penna abble thicket opened on one side in the other to offer in the path
he entered a large four cord and stood still with amazement an all
but the faces of the men were rosy and the goblets by them had a few drops of wine left
he entered the guard room there the guards stood had drawn up and mind with carbines at their shoulders but they were sound asleep
he passed through one apartment after another where were ladies and gentleman sleep in their chairs are standing
i waited mon fort you
they talked for four hours and it not then said half that was in their heads to say
meanwhile all the rest of the people in the castle had been awakened at the same moment is the princess and they were now extremely hungry
but lady and waiting became very impatient and at length the nouns to the princess that they all waited for her
then the prince took the princess by the hand she was dressed in great splendor but he didn not h that she looked as he had seen pictures of his great grandmother look he thought her all the mor charing for that
the violins and how boys played old but excellent pieces of music and after supper to lose no time the grand oman married the royal lovers and the chapel of the castle
he turned to showed on the castle but behold
when she said goodnight to bey and went to her chamber over that were the loved parent and friend would fall sleep no more she felt as if she went walking longed to her toob
at the time mary had noted nothing of these things now she saw them all alice for the first time in my new to tale while slowly she went up the stair and threw the narrowed ways and her the same wind that raved like about the new grave in the old house into which latter for all the bil spank against the walls if found many a chink of entrance
when she opened the door that the bright fire which beany undesired had kindled there startled her the room looked unnatural uncanny because it was cheerful
she stood for a moment on the hearth anden sad dreamy mood listened to the howling swoops of the wind making the house quiver and shake
this was her dream as nearly as she could recall it when she came to herself after waking from it with a cry
she was one of a large company at a house for she had never been before a beautiful house with a large garden behind
it was a summer knight and the guests were wandering in and outed will and threw house and garden amid lovely things of all colors and os
but she knew nobody and wandered alone in the garden oppressed was something she did not understands
at the end it she was in a place of tomes
she entered and the servants soft pled in silent were busy carrying away the vessels of hospitality and restoring order as if already they prepared for another company on the morrow no one heat did her
she was lost lost utterly with an eternal loss
she knew nothing of the place had no where to go now where she wanted to go had not have thought to tell her what questioned to ask if she met e living soul
but living soul there could be none to meat
she lost him years and years before and now she saw him he was there and she knew him
he came to her side and she gave a him no greeting
i know it and there is no waking
the old time was but a thicker dream and this is true because more shadowy
her only life was that she was lost
shallow i po out my soul into the ear of a mist of f from my own brain
thus was she born away captive of her dead neither willing nor unwilling of life and death equally careless
with bac a pang of intense pain
she herself should have been the poem a alaric in white gown and green scarf coming to him through the long grass under the blossomed bows
her hands should have been full of bluebells and she should have held them upo to his face and mably defence as he sprang forward to take her in his arms
you see that she knew exactly how trust his conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheaper wiggly journals
she had to the full it aloud of her reading in her environment the literary sense
and curiously enough she was hardly curious at all ab what he might have to say
she only wished for may and the orchard instead of january and the deny dusty waiting room the plain fac preoccupied travellers the dim desolate weather
the setting of the scene seemed to her all important
it was bitterly call but they embankment was more attic than a really carriage
he had been late he had offered no excuse no explanations
but here the only thing that occurred to her was to stop them and look in m of the shops till he should ask her what she was looking at
the ken wind thrust itself even inside the high collar of her jacket
her hands and feet were aging with cold
she would have shared his sorrow and showed herself half wife path angel from heavens in this dark hour
shes how frightfully cul is
and yester day had aw from her and she seems to expects to think and i thoughted tell you darling
a shock of u believe able relief tingle through hers who pat was all what was it compared with fears
what opinions what he form of the purity of her mind the en sents of her soul if an incident like this s failed to shocker deeply
following the tingle of relief came a sharp sickening pens of jealousy and mortifications these inspired her
i don't wonder you were afraid to tell me she began you don't love me you've never lovely i was any it to belie did
those four true words wounded her more than all the rest
couldn't help it then how can i over truste
do you think i not sorry now
no it's only painful bot of us
i don't think some maner do such things she was pulling on her glows go hm and glover at all
he stood up suddenly doan that
i really going to throw me over fore thing like this
and he strewed down between the marvel tables and out by the swing door and was a very good e ex it
at the cord he remember that he had gone away without pang for the tea and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy that ar
he checked the i pulse
so he had listed and went sale arica and he never came home covered with meets and glory which was rather his idea to the few subs of explanations that would have made all straight and repaid her and him for all the past
the last strains of the ill treat ill fainted into mezzanine away and after them had died away also the rumbling of the wheels of the murder spar organ that had so gaily executed that along with the nine other tunes of its repertory to the admirations of the house made at the window of the house opposite and the crowing delight of the two baby's next door
the young man drew a deep breth of relief and lighted the wax candles in the solid silver candlesticks on his writing tablet for now the late summer dus was falling and that organ please heaven made fool the leasure of the days appointed torture
th there silence th a sigh and the sound of light moving feet on the gravel
and again he listened with a quiet pleasure

there is a seat in the garden at the side of the house again shee hesitated
then she turned towards the quarter indicated in disappeared round moral bushes

when she returned his hand was sticking through the whole door
the cries and purses of the robs filled the air
they tried in vain to to break down the great doors
all my worries about you were foolish

and as soon as their parents had got to sleep he got up put on his coat and unbarring the back door went out
ah fathers said hand sol i am looking at my wait cat sitting upon the roof of the house and trying to say good by
but in reality hansome was not looking at a cat but every time he stopped he dropped the pebble out of his pocket upon the path
but her husband felt heavy at heart and thought it were better to share the last pros with the children
early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled the out of bed and ga them e sled of bread which was stills smaller than the former piece

then she took a handsome with her rough hand and shut him up in a little ka with the lat store and although he scream loudly it was of no use
whet began to cry but it was all useless for old which made her do as she mounted

and she got up and put her head into the oven
and now as there was nothing to fear they went back to the witches house where an every corner were caskets full of pearls and precious stones
then they began to run and rushing into the house they fellow upon their father's neck
not having heard from captain bick for some little time randal thoughted desirable innes interest to make inquiries at his club
the sailing master announced that he had orders to take the vessel back to her port with no other explanations than that the crews was over
this alternative in the captain's plans terminating the voyage month earlier than is arrangements had contemplated puzzled randal
randal waited while in london on the chance had pic might pay him a visit
he is staying at this hotel to try the air of side them and he finds that it grez with him them
had her beauty fascinated him
randal wot to accepting invitations determining to present himself before the appointed hour and to questioned catherine privately without giving her the advantage over him of preparing herself for the interview
after months of separations he received a visit from from herbert
he distress me herbert more than words can say
he drank the wine greedily
whatever reviving effected might otherwise had produced on him it made no change in the threatening gloom of his manner
he put downed the empt glass taking no notice of his brother's questioned
rand he said you know where syne is
i will do neither the one nor the other
you don't know what it is to be used to seeing a pretty creature always nicely dressed always about the room thinking so much of v you and so little of herself and then to be left alone as i am left out in the dark
i'm alone do you hear that alone
i haven't courage enough to do it from for myself
oh why did i engaged that governess
i'm afraid he said
i tried it yesterday its set my brains on fire um feeling that glass i took just now
he paused and put his hand to his fevered head
his mind wandering into some other train of of thoughte
you can't do it
let me here his first
i feel for you het he said warmly
she shall have your message all that i can doe to persuade her shall be done
let me rest a little he pleaded if im not in the way
he mentioned the name of one of the olds servant s mountain moran who had attached himself to rand after to the break up family
on the next day but one rand arranged his departure for side them so as to arrive at the hotel and hour before the time appointed for the dinner
the new re number of a pop weekly journal had that day been published randal bot it
after reading one or two of the political articles heeded that the calms specially devoted to fashionable intelligence
randal looked again at the first words in the paragraph
with his own suspicions steadily contradicting him he arrived that at the hotel obstinately believing that the charming widow would prove to be a stranger
missus norman and her little daughter w out driving with a friend and were expected to returning good time for dinner
missus presty was at home she was was reported to be in the garden of the hotel
how nice of you to come so soon she began
she added looking at him suspiciously
but you watt have known that weir only half an hour behinde you at side them in the matter of news
there report as premature m good friend
but if these news paper people waited to findin out whether report is tre false how much gossip would society get in its favorite news papers
you are to understand that catherine is a widow
sit down said missus presty
you shall hear how my divorce daughter and my poor little grandchild retreated at sandy seal after youll left us
you would have seen her pining for the company of other children and would have had no mercy on her
he was introduced to missus norman to missus norman's little girl and we were all charmed with him
when he i happen to be left together he naturally wondered after having seen the beautiful wife where the lucky husband might be
and the captain of course concluded after having been introduced the kitty that missus norman was a widow
wor stories have been printed i do as sure you were a stories he been printed
before i consented to answer the childs inquiries i came to an understanding with her mother
honestly
after that i had her mother's authority for telling kitty that she would never see her father again
she asked directly if her fathers was dead
that will do missus presty yet defences thoroughly worthy of your conduct in all other respects
raddle pass over without notice
a very wise decision she remarked
have you any message for captain py deck
not at the hotel just now
it was a relief to randal in the present state of catherine's relations towards ben to return to london without having seene his friend
good by dear randal
arrived at the stations randal found that he must wait for the train
while he was walking up and down the platform with a mind duly distressed by anxiety about his brother in anxiety about sneer train from london came in
water you doing here he asked
you have been to the hotel he burst out you have seen catherine
we have both seen the same newspaper of course and you have been the first de clear the thing up that's it is in it
not satisfied with gasp been private the greedy public appetite the vows gossip been print and once more it any one editor can supply
supposing the report had been true
in the meantime afterward missus presty had confessed the cruel falsehood which had checked po city's natural inquiries raised than in supper b obstacle to a meeting be tween father and child
he had promised to do his bestest towards persuading catherine to grants sidney and interview
even the chance of successfully confiding her to bey ex protections had lost something of its fair promise since randal visit to aside them
be the results however what they might randal could see but one plain course before him now
considerations of delicacy seemed to forbid taking this liberty even within intimate friend
what happy your future could await her especially she justified randal's past experience of all that was candid truthful in their character then to become his friends
shall i say that she may expect early visit from for you when i see her to morrow
he added signs a dress and a po script and despatched his letter that evening
but it might perhaps be excusable to infer that the marriage hadad not yet been decided on and that the captain's proposals were still waiting for catherine's reply
go do you here
but i less th five minutes the staircase grown beneath an extraordinary wit
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centered in his eyes which became blooded the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple though he was struck without lacy nothing was wanting toc complete this but the utterance of a cry
and the cry issued from his pours if we may u speak a cry frightful in it silence

davy unable to beare the side of touching emotion turned away and laft without seeking any further explanations and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnis on which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we morn extended his hand towards the young man
