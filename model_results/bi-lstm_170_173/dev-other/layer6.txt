as i approached a city i heard bells winging and little later i found the streets to stir with throngs of well dressed people in family groups winding their way hither and thither
looking about me i saw gentleman in a meat black dress smiling and his hand extended to me great cordiality
he must have realized i was a stranger and wished he tendered his hospitality to me i accepted it gratefully i clasped his hand he pressed on him
we gazed for a moment s lightly into each other's eyes
of course you are going there too i said to my friendly guide
yes he answered i cannot the worship i am a priest
an idle i whispered taken by surprise
they worship god they did not exist
but the greeks love their gods i protested my heart clamly my breast
no i said in a low voice
he was an idle then and not a god
it may ath int to see of light he created the beautiful the true the good yes our religion was divine
it had only one fault in trooped my guide what was that
i inquired without knowing what his aunts would be it was not true
produce him
i wish me to myself what blas for me
then taking heart i told my guide how more than once i had felt apollo's grading at presence in my heart and told him of the immortal lines of home were concerned the d vine apollo
do you doubt homan
i said to him homer the inspired barred
no no a paula is not an idle
he is a god and a son of a god
the air was heavy with incense a number of men and gorgeous vestments were passing to and fro thou in a kneeling before the various lights and images
observing my anxiety to understand the mean of all this my guide took me aside and in a whisper told me that a people were celebrating the anniversary of the birth the other beautiful saviour jesus the son of god
forget apollo he said with his as jest of severity his voice
there is no such person he was only an idle
if he would assert for apollo and all the universe would never find e one answering to his name or description
i won doe jesus i hasten turning toward him
will he not be here this morning
will he not speak to his worshippers i asked again
will he not permit them to touch him to caress his hand to class was divined feet to and held the ambrosial fragrance of his breath to bask and the golden light of his eyes to hear the music of his immaculate accents
i asked my eyes feel with wonder in my voice quitting with excitement
would not that then i vent to ask impatiently may ease as much of an idle is apollo
and if faith that jesus is a god pros him a god while will not faith in apollo make him re god
but i am determined not only to know if it is possible the whole truth about jesus but also to communicate that truth through others
but there is more of a moral tonic and the open and candid discussion of a subject like the one in hand then in the multitude of platitudes
i never to live or lecture in which i do not either directly or indirectly if full and free expression to my faith in everything that is worthy of faith
if i do not believe in dogma is is because i believe in freedom
oh he tears down but hes not build up is another crisis him about my work it is not true
no preacher a prey is more constructive
classing truth in a jail wagging the mouth of the student is that building up or tearing down
when bringe why the new torch to increase the lie of the world who was his f roard the stake

as intelligent beans would desire to know where this jesus whose wor she was not only costing the world millions of the people's money but which is also drawing to his service a time the energies the affections the devotions and the labor humanity is a myth or reality
a number of other dates were observed with a christian church of various times as the birthday of jesus the goss was give no date and appear to be quite uncertain really ignorant about it
yet there is no evidence that he was born on that day
why this descent sey and historical document to say nothing about inspiration

that in the absents of evidence or in offers a folly metaphysical arguments against this sceptical selves one
if we are to have any mythology at all he seems to argue why object to adding to it the mess of jesus
the immediate companions of jesus appeared to be another hand as mythical as he is himself
who was matthew who was mark
who were john peter judas and merry
there is actuly no evidence that they ever existed
if peter ever went to rome with the new doctrine hows it that no historian has taken note of him
here again we see the presence of a myth
he was the only one who saw them
peter paul john james judas i'll keep o the stage almost as exclusively
it is impossible to explain why the contemporaries of jesus the authors in the historians of the this time you not take notice of him
could they have been in a conspiracy against him
hows is his unanimous sides be a count for
how then are we to decide which the numerous candidates for divine honor should be human our votes
and such a faith is never free it is always maintained but a sword now and by heal fi hereafter
yet the most impossible utterances are put in juice mouth
only a mythical jesus could virtually hand over the govern of levers de corners who have petitions to press upon his attention
moreover give jesus could keep his promise there would be today no misery in the world no orphans no childless mothers no shipwrecks no floods no famines no disease no crippled children no one sanity no wars no crime no wrong
have these prayers been answered
how he self deluded profits these extravagant claims have produced
and who can number the bitter disappointments caused by such impossible promises
the same which a preachers of to day give he parried his aunts with many words in at lengths said that the promise was be taken with the provisions that what we asked for would be given if god thought it for our good
but he said if he as hevening in my name i will do it and if it were not so i would have told you
did he not mean just what he said
self effort and not prayer is a really against ignorance slavery poverty and more degradation
it was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of in congruity when with impressible persons love becomes solicitous ness hope sings to misgiving and faith to hope when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret and opportunities for ambition that had been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise
still to a close observer they are just as perceptible the difference is that their media of manifestation are less trite and familiar than such well known ones as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf
if anything will be darker than the sky it was the wall and if anything could be gloomier than the wall it was the river beneath

the shape went slowly along but without much exertion for the snow though sudden was not as yet more than two inches deep
at this time some words were spoken aloud one

then a mossul snow flew across the rather towards the fifth windows
the river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort which races middle and sides with the same delighting precision any irregularities of speeded being immediate corrected by small whir pul
the window struck again in the same manner
then a noise was heard apparently produced by the opening of the window

he determined to call immediately on the new incarnation
she if not far from the long fashionable hamptons shire square and he went thither with expectations of having a highly emotional time at least
but somehow the very bell pool seemed cold although she had sir earnestly asked him to come

she thought a little and then they went on to talk about her house which had been newly painted and decorated with greenish blue satin up to the height of a person's head an arrangement that somewhat improved her slightly faded tho still pretty face and was helped by the awnings over the windows

before durin d scored to the enemy i saw steeds white with foam and after the shout of battle a fearful torrent
these tidings came to urban

and the tis she said in the word she had spoken a welcome
and evil be tied me said he if thou returnest here until thou knows whether i have lost my strength so completely as thou dis say

my lord he added will it be displeasing to be if i asked whence thou comest also

the sax containing this last added to the goods already mentioned make a really heavy de kao and one is naturally anxious concerning it but everything that can be done by lashing in securing has been done
forage i originally ordered thirty tons of compressed oaten hay from melbourne
the scene is wholly enchanting and such a view from some sheltered sunny corner in a god in which blazed with masses of red in golden flows tends to feelings of inexpressible satisfaction with all things
a great massive people assembled

a third sledge stand across the break of the poop and this space hitherto occupied by they after which
the quantities to aha tons and the space occupied considerable
the ship was over two feet by the stern but this will soon be remedied
they must perforce be chained up and they had given what shelters afforded on deck but their position is not enviable
it is a pathetic attitude deeply significant of cold and misery occasionally some poor beast and mits a long pathetic wine
there are generally wanted too on watch which ease matters but it is a squash
later in the day the wind his ve to the westward heading u slightly
oats and atkinson with intermittent assistance or mothers or busy keeping the ponies on their legs
there was nothing forward but to grapple with the evil and nearly all hands were laboring for hours in the waists of the ship heaving coal sacks overboard and re lashing the petal cases et cetera and the best man a possible under such difficulty and dangerous circumstances
no sooner with some semblance of order restored th some exceptionally heavy way would tear away the lashing and the work had to be done all over again
from this moment above for the injure room became the centre of interest
the water gained his spite of every effort
the outlook apaid grim
the amount of water which was being made with the ship so roughly handled was most uncertain
williams had to confess he was beaten and must draw fires what was to be done
the built pompous depended on the main engine
on one occasion i was wast deep on standing on the rail of the pooh
the after god will organized in two poddies by evans to work buckets the men were kept steadily going on the choked hand pumps this seemed all that could be done for the moment and what imaged a count is the soul safe got of the ship from sinking practically and attempt to bail her out
occasionally a heavy sea would bear one of them away and he was only save by his chain
the fond had taken this morning meal and now lay crowed up on a bed of moss
when never the faun cot up he was quite contain to frisk about
the danger was certain now it was near
the hows had struck a trail where she turned and the fawn was sa
one was rolling the other had a gun in his hand what should she do
her tired lakes could not propel the ti at bode rapidly
the go saw the boat nearing her
in a moment more the boat was on her and the man at the oars had leaned over and cut her
i was tormented by thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctor's orders
the old men sees to give so much annoyance yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams
pill ere given them orders not to speak to me of this
this mid had stolen from me certain little things of some importance and in her fear being effected she would have had been very glad if i had died
accordingly she allowed me twice to take us much as i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask full i then covered myself and began to sweat and fell into a deep sleep
they say that my poor friend was on the point of falling to the ground so graved was he to hear this
afterwards he took an agly sta and began to beat the serving girl with all his mind shouting out ahhh traitress you have killed him for me then
she meane did have saved my life so led me a helping hand for i have sweat it and be quick about it
phil cure recovered his spirits dried and made me comfortable and i been conscious of a great improvement in my state began to reckon on recovery
just then the other doctor bernardino put in his appearance who had the beginning of my illness had refused to bleed me
my trenches coes that most able mame exclaimed oh power of nature
she knows what she requires and the physicians know nothing
that sim bot mice rubber nino made user saying if he had drunken ne the bottle he would have been cured upon the spot
afterwards he turned to me and asked i could have drunk more water
i answered no because i had entirely pointed my thirst
in like manner she was asking for what she wanted when the poor young men bag de to bleed him
if you knew that is recovery depended upon his drinking two flasks on water why did you not say so before
you might then have boasted of his kill
at this words the wretched quiet sulkily departed and never showed his face again
the very evening i was taken with great precautions in a chair well wrapped up and protected from the cold
do not permitting any irregularities for though he had escaped this time another disorder now would be the death of him
then he turned to me and said my ven v nuo be prudent c meet no excesses and when you are quite recovered i beg you to make me a madonna with your own hand and i will always pay my devotions to it for your sake
so i made my mind up and prepared to travel
that day many friends came to see me among others pierre laddie who was the best a dearest friend i ever had
next day that came as certain niccolo d monte ago who was also a very great friend of mine
i had harboured him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house upside down for the man was subjects to a species of dry scan which he was always in the habit of scratching with his head
meanwhile that able physician francs go d monte vari attended to my cure with great skill
there they sid at me to wait until the duke went by
many of my friends at court came up to greet me and expressed surprised that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shattered by illness this said that i ought to have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke
at this words my agostino the duke's taylor made his way through all those gentleman and said it that's all you want to know you shall know it at this very moment
george wass a painter whom i have mentioned happen just then to pass and myer agostino exclaimed there is the man who accused you now you know yoursel if it be true or not
as fy as i could not being able to leave my seat i asked george if it was true that he had accused me
he denied that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sword
myer agostino retorted you gallows bird
don't you know that i know it for most certain
george made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me
then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted it
the duke gazed at me and marvell i was deal alive afterwards he vade me take he to be an honest man and regain my hells
when i reached home n color montagu came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadfuls perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin written with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterward ta french leaf because my joy came from a quarter and a man who was able to destroy me
i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had endured me and told him all the affair about the mint
he repeated get hands quickly as you can and be of good courage for you will see you vengeance executed sooner than you expects
i the best attention to my health gave pierre thro bag lo advice about stamping the coins and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else
you want them to immortalized that ferocious tyrant
you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you are invent it fo and there devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mine to hang you without any fault of yours
it was firmly believed that duke alessandro was the sun of pope cleanin
mer francesco used also to say and swear by all he saints that if he could he would have robbed me of the dies for that meadow
i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more
i now send to florence to request lorn sen on that he would say me the reverse of the meadow
nic color da monte good to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher laud se not for it he had replied he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better event one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bring it without hesitation to the duke for this would be to my advantage
i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate im pressed the word forward to my best ability
this being so as he was a fellow of much humour we used often to laugh together about the great credit he had gain
i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling peas ready and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball
i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to hit my mark at two hundreds cubits which cannot be done by otherways of b loading
i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we made haste for rome
we have succeeded in a massing two hundreds ounces of silver enough i trust to erect a handsome bronze figure
to be sure it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priest's boasting about i could live it ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose
but the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrades thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of cana
here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in fairy boats that start as soon as sum twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked
when the boatmen a passengers heard the splash and saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made everye effort to save him but the wind was fair and the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him
when he saw this the room feign the utmost grief and dismay said to his fellow passengers this priest whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kio to visit the shrine of his patron and as i happened to have business there as well we settled to travel together
now last by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone
he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believed a story i'm pitied and tried to comfort him
then the rad and said to the boatmen
what thank you gentlemen added he turning to the og the travellers
they of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their onward journey and all with one voice agreed to what the ran and had proposed and so the matter was settled
when at length they reached the shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the ran it overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priests luggage and putting it with his own pursued his journey to kiote
fortune favouring his speculations he began to a mask great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself nothing and in the course of time he married a wife who bore him a child
since then allay gone well with me yet had i not been poor i had never turned to sassin nor thief
he would have fled into the house but the go stretched forth its withered arm and clutching the back of his neck scaled at him with a vindictive glare and a hideous ghastliness of mean so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear
at length undone by such ceaseless vexation took a bay fell ill and kept muttering oh misery misery the wandering priest is coming to torture me
now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest to lodged in the next treat
and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all over
three years ago at the cana fairy you flung me into the water and well you remember it
happily continued the priest i had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so i reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded and setting up a bronze figure to buda des fulfilling the wish of my heart
on my journey homewards i took a lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvelous ailment
thinking i could divine it cause i came to see you and am glad to find i was not mistaken
and would it not ill become me to bear malice
repent therefore and abandon your evil ways
to see you do so i should esteem the height of happiness
be of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that i am really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you
and a fit of madness i was tempted to kill and bobbio
fortune befriended me ever after but the richer i crew the more keenly i felt how wicked i had been and the more i foresaw that my victim's vengeance with some day overtake me
haunted by this thought i lost my nerve till one night i beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill
but how you managed to escape in her still alive is more than i can understand

no well managed family would think of building a new house without finding in what direction to pace the front door
after this manner has been settled and the houses fairly begun there are o casal crises in its construction upon which much depends
of these the most importance the day when the ruth was raised

on the day after the death often in the evening the body must we placed in the cask shaped cough and net until recently was a style commonly a using japan
now among the wealthier classes the long coffin has superseded the small square or round one but the smaller expense connected with the burial in the old way makes a survival of an old type a necessity for the majority of japanese
at an appointed time all the relatives assemble in the death chamber and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse
there' is no official ceremonial morning of parents for their children nor does custom require them to perform any of the last rights or attend the funeral
upon the younger brothers and sisters falls the duty of attending to all the last sad ministrations
when the body has been washed as as dressed in white in sil cabo time whenever the family inform it
the body to be placed in the coffin must be folded into a sitting posture the chin resting upon the knees the position of the mummies found in many aboriginal american tombs
this difficulty to us apparently impossible feet safely accomplished there are placed in the coffin and number of small things that the dead takes with him to the nest world
the single exception to this rule about metal is that small copper coins may be put in to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death
last of all the vacant spaces in the coffin e filled in with bags of tea
so long as the coffin is in the house it must be watched over continually
it is their duty to see that the incense burning before the coffins never allowed to go out while the food for the dead is renewed regular intervals by the mourners themselves
there are few enlightened japanese who will defend the present system of cruelty to the afflict it or who do not long for some change but so great as the force of conservatism in this regard so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack of respected the dead that reformed advances slowly
individual instance h occurring which some of the worst features of these customs are modified
a case and point is that of the late mister fu kisa a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countryman in modern ways and who in his death continued his teaching
in his will he provided that his body was to be buried without washing in the clothing in which he died
through these growing feeling and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies
just before the procession starts or religious ceremony is held at the house which is attended by the friends of the deceased and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery
on the day of the burial great bunches of natural flowers are sent to the dead each bunch so largest to require the services one man to carry it
sometimes with the gifts a man is sent to take part in the possession but if the giver fields too poor to higher a man this burden too falls upon the braved household for edict requires that all flowers sent be borne to the grave by uniform coolies wh march in the funeral train
another favour president at this time among buddhists is a cage of living birds to be borne to the grave th released thereon
it seems more like a bridal than a burial
during this period the spirit of the deceased is supposed to be still inhabiting the house and a tablet or shin is set up in the death chamber before which food and flowers are renewed daily

it happened that that afternoon a somewhat noted newspaper correspondent was passing the gram and on his way to an editorial convention in a neighboring city
she was a common street drunkard and yet the services of the tent were as impressive as any i ever witnessed in a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen
it struck me of course being a stranger in the place with considerable astonishment to hear voices like those one naturally expects to hear only in great churches or concerts at such a meeting is this
mister maxwell spoke at the fact that the dead woman had been fully prepared to go but he spoke in a peculiarly sensitive manner of the effect of the liquor business on the lives of man and women like this one
raymond of course being a railroad town and the centre of the great packing interests for this region is full of saloons
then followed what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service
it was one of the sym blest and at the same kind one of the most impressive sights i ever witnessed
there must have been a hundred of these women and i was told many of them had been converted at the meetings just recently
there was no answer and after one or two ineffectual attempts pony turned fearfully away

for answer mister king set her down hastily on the floor and took two or three turns up and down the room
oh i do so wish i might she said there's so much for a little girl like me
it will be so nice to have charlotte half some with me still no answer
i was writing a note to missus fargo said phronsie putting up her lips ricks

not to the young gracious the young mantle himself into a chair

which is a wonder interpolated pickering

for heaven's sake pickering cried his uncle darting in further the chair in its restless of top don't say that again
i've been a lazy daw all my life and a good for not but i hope i've not sunk to that
the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous fresh of a starry eyed flush cheek young woman who demanded
where is he pete miss billy gasped the old man
aunt hanna's cheeks too were flushed in her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way pet had said miss billy's name
it was one matter for her to objected this thing bill he was doing but quite another for pet to do it of course it's she
retorted aunt hana testily as if you yourself and bring her here with your crazy messages of this time of night pet where is he
interposed billy tell mister ver tre i am here or wait i'll go wright it and surprise it
pet had recovered himself by now but he did not even glanced toward aunt hannah
miss billie miss billy your an angel straight from heaven you are you are oh i'm so glad you came
it'll be all right now all right he's in the den miss billie
billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall aunt hanna indignant voice arrested her billy stopped
pet go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receive us peats lips twitched
but his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke
a flying figure brush by him and fell on it sees by the couch with a low cry bertram's eyes flew open
don ling found him there minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringe napkin that had been spread over bertrams tray
in the hall above aunt hanna was crying into william's gray w and duster that hung on the hall rack aunt hanna's handkerchief was on the floor back at hillside
then very gradually it dawned over them that there was after all something strange and unexplained it at all
as if to make sure that she was he or like this he drew her even closer bertin was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable
why of course stander dei i couldn't help thinking that maybee you had found out you didn't want me
demanded bertram angry and mystified
as for my not painting again you did' understand pet deary
she pulled herself half away from bertrams and circling arm
billy you a quivering sigh
good heavens is kate in this too bertram's voice with savage now
well she rote a letter
billy laughed gaily but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes
and you never did think for a minute billy that you cared for him
he had not been slow a marked that swift lowering for eyelids
billy was so glad bertram had turned the question on her love instead of arkwright
after a minute billy stirred in side happily
you see i wasn't in love with mister arright
and and you didn't care it special be for from his wink up
billy put a soft finger on his lips
virtue kissed the finger and subsided hoop he commented
well what is that is that kate too demanded bertram grimly
there was another silence then suddenly bertram stirred
billy i'm going to marry you to morrow he announced decisively
i don't know as i can trust you out of my sight till then you'll read something or hear something or get a letter from kate after breakfast to morrow morning that will set you saving me again and i don't want to be saved that way
i'm going to marry you to morrow i'll get he stopped short with a sudden frown can't found that law i forgot
hy days indeed sir
i wonder if you think i can get ready to be married in five days
don't want you to get ready retorted bertram promptly i saw marie ready and i had all i wanted of it
if you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace ruffling will do it afterwards not before but
besides i needed you to take care of me cut in bertram craftily
the tender glow on billy's face told its own story and bertram's eager eyes were not slow to read it
sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm
billy my dear
it was aunt hanna's plaintive voice at the doorway a little later
we must go home and will you is here too and wants to see you
you mean it'll be before october
aunt hand a glance from one to the other uncertainly
yes nodded billy to merely
yes id know that is a good while cut in bertram marly
we wanted it to morrow what we had to wait on a count of the new licence law
yet so strong was the effect upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectation of the word which should make him rich
a part of that impression was due to the engagement which he must now fulfill
to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes
because in his salad days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many chance step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that roar attachment
unable to think of work he left the house and wandered gloomily about re jo's park
he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marian who was fades instrument
he wrote to maria
will you let me hear or come seem
i scarcely thought of before as likely to kill himself
but why the je did he go all the way he there
i hop he would bring me subdues
poy i can only suppose
but i will see weal daown i hadn't come across biffin for a long time
was he still so merry poor
asked amy compassionately
i'm afraid sigh his book failed utterly
oh if i had imagined him stilly in such distress surely i might have done something to help you
perchance his death was impart attributable to that hopeless love
he sent me a copy of his novel she said and i saw him once or twice after that
having this subject to converse upon put the two more quickly at east that could otherwise have been the case
ay might take a foremost place among giving women
especially now that her father is threatened with blindness
is it so serious
even if mister ell recovers his side it is not at all likely that he will be able to work as before
our difficult is a so grave that
he paused and led his hand failed despondently
i have a good deal of will you remember and what i have set my mind upon no doubt i shall some day achieve
there was sons
the last three years he continued have made no slight difference in my position
recall where i stood when you first new be
just now i am in need of a little encouragement
you don't notice any falling off in my work recently
did you see my things in the current and so on generally
sometimes i believe i have detected you when there was no signature
her story at that girl's paper has attracted attention
and i could so easily put her of rest by renouncing all plain upon her
i surmise that that you yourself would also be put at rest by such a decision
joan look at me with that ironical smile he pleaded
i couldn't go about declaring that i was heartbroken in any event i must be content for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgments are pretty sure to be unfavorable what can i do
the case is too delicate i fear for my advice
well i'll go back to my scribing
again just beheld the white soft haid for a superfluous moment
yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry
baron could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companions smooth countenance
she had divined that there was some grave reason for this sons and the paining with which she approached was half caused by the anxious beats of her heart
he began abruptly
he gave her such details he had obtained then added
there are two of my companions fallen in the battle
i ought think myself a lucky fellow mary what
you would better fitted to fight your way jasper
more of the bat e nan
here no very well i don't
i have made up my mind about our affairs he went tor presently
yes
will you marry them and let us take their chins
you feel yourself indispensable to your father at present
i should be so afraid of the effect upon his health jasper
she paused and looked up at him touchingly
dear i can't feel it would be my duty to renounce she because my father had become blind
has one thing occurred to you
will he consent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is missus nor vay
and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him
she listened anxiously and reflected
as i have said there is a very serious doubt whether your father would accept money for you when you were my wife
it isn't your fault marian and well then there's only one thing to do
except jasper very father is helpless i must find means of assuring his support
do you think them insurmountable
that is just for i have decided is impossible m you shall have the plain truth
i don't trust myself
but shall you fac them willingly
put up your umbrella marian
what do i care for a drop of vain she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is it stake howe am i to understand you
everyone you speaks seems intended to d hearten me
why need y you can seal if that is the truth
is that what you mean by saying you distrust yourself
we must see each other again marian
how am i to live an hour in such uncertainty as this
i do wish it
her emotion had an effect on him and his voice trembled
there is no natural law that a child should surrender everything for her parents
you know so much more of the world that i did can't you advise me
this there no way of providing for my father
good god this is frightful marian i can't stand it
i will be faithful to you
he had made a pretence of holding his umber over her but marian turned away and walked to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a great tree her face averted from him
moving to follow he saw that her frame was shaken by soundless sobbing
in what could there be more selfishness
but i couldn't say on word that would seem to invite such misery as this
you don't love me jasper and that's an end of everything
happiness or misery come to us by fight
is if in my pow to make you happy
but if you had said you loved me before that i should have it always to remember
if i believe anything i believe that i did love you
what can you say to me more than you have said now
remember me as a man who disregarded priceless lu such as yours to go and make himself a proud position among fools a knaves indeed that what its come too
soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merited my perverse pride would revolt against it
what can be simper than the truth
it is a thing that happens everyday either in a man or woman and all would hor demands is the courage to confess the truth
marian will you do this will he let her engagement last another six mons but without how meeting during that time
that sings to be childish
the rain fell unceasingly and with it begin to mingle ano tum mist
just but delaid a moment then asked calmly
are you going to the museum yes
go home again for this morning marian you can't work
we must and i have no time to lose
goodby she gave him her hand
they looked at each other for an easton then marian left the shelter of the trim opened her umbrella and walked quickly away
jasper did not watch her he had the face of a man who was suffering a severe humiliation
his sister said very little for she recognized genuine suffering in his times and aspect
a fear wings ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest affection but who is very rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him
yes no morning he received her final answer i refusal
you will understand they surely you needed no fresh proof how utterly unworthy he is of you
you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you
several days passed before there came a reply
i must only ask that you will write to me without the least reference to these troubles tell me always about yourself and be sure that you cannot tell me too much
we had been but little of that minute had accurate knowledge of the interior of the covin it which was requisite for determination of the problem
several diffrent parties were therefore organized to examine the various routs supposed to be practicable within the northern and southern limits of united states
the only discrimination made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficulty of execution of all the surveys
he inquiries were made with regard to gun power which subsequently led to the use of a coarser grain for artillery
the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil wife
under instructions from the presents the list was therefore revised and modified accordance with this new element of geograpical distribution
after some further discussion of the question the visitors withdrew dissatisfied with the result of the interview
the quartermaster general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake and the appointing to the office had been confounded with his father who was a well known whig but that he the sun was a democrat
i assured the general that this was altogether immaterial adding that it was a very pretty quarrel as it stood and that i had no a desire to effect a settlement of it on any inferior issue
nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the fox hounded very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of sighs
if you want to hunt your harriers on foot sixteen inches is quite big enough almost too big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches as a useful height or even nineteen jes
it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule asked color it is so much a matter of individual taste
but puppies are usually sent out to walk and may easily be procured to be captain reared until their old enough to behinde to their work
he is of course finer but with the length of neck so perfect in the bigger hound the little shoulders of the same pattern and the typical quarters and second flies
and when he is fairly on a line of course he sticks to it as the saying his like a beagle
it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otterhound to get more size and power as their certainly was a welsh rough coated beale of good eighteen inches and an almost at dental contemporary that was called these beagle
that a great many of the true order were bred became very manifest as soon as the harrier and beagle association was formed and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hound show was reserved for them
then they seem to spring from every part of the country
one hears now of the jost him they house had place very noted indeed the halting the le park the stoke place the eden bird the servan the trinity foot the wood dale missus gude hills missus prices and missus turners
eyes brown dark casal poor hazel not deep set nor bulgy and with a mild expression
ears long set on low finding texture and hanging in a graceful fold close to the cheek
neck moderately long slyly arched the throat showing some du lap
shoulders clean and slightly sloping
forelegs quite street f well under the dog of good substance and round in the bone
feet round well knuckling up and strongly patted
coat smooth variety smooth very dense and not too fine or short
height not exceeding sixteen inches
all things which follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of god must always exist and be infinite or in other words are each herne anden infinite through they said attribute
proof conceive if it be possible supposing the proposition to be denied that the something in some attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of these said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought
in its nature infinite
must necessarily exist
we have now grated therefore thoughts not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of god does not naturally follow from its nature in so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of god which is against ohs
and beyond the limits of the duration of the idea of god supposing the latter at some time not to have existed for not to be going to exists thought would perforce have existed without the idea of god which is contrary to our hypothesis for we suppose that thought being given the idea of god ne sairly flowed there fr
barn mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from god's absolute nature
cory hands it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is ins colic phraseology god is cause of the being of things as sandy rm
corollary individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of god or modes by which the attributes of god are expressed in a fixed and definite manner
such a cour such a time you never did see
i was wishing somebody would give the conversation a start we an indiana made a break

never mind polly said jasper there's all next summer and after our winter and dressed in and all our hard work over music one of be fine those had jaunt round again and his eyes glistened
and you'll go on drawing and painting till you gets to be a great artist ran on polly enthusiastically and then will see something you've donelson del oh dear me polly pepper
tom sell one had been very sober during all this mary chatter and now in his seat across the narrow ale he drawed his heels impatiently on the floor
what's up little mother asked tom in surprise at her unusual manner it's this tom
when the news was circulated as it was pretty soon that the party was not to be broken into it all till paris was a completed story the jubilation was such as to satisfy even tom
oh isn't it oates peas beams in barley girl cried colly as they watched them intently
and his long arm went out and picked a jack an end of an urchin who incautiously regarding such quiet travellers is not worth minding had hovered two year while trying to tease the girls
and presently a woman came and took little blue pinafore off and then the rest of the girls unclasped their hands and the ring melted away in the game was over
i'm glad the girls overhear half fun said polly as grand pon is party moved off isn't it nice to think they do
two or three days of rest at marine put everyone in good shape and gave them all a bit of time to pick up on many little things that worked behind hand
that's my third letter polly announced jasper on the other side of the table now im going to begin on joe's
one too said polly counting why i thought i'd written three well this one is most finished jasper
dare said tom delighted to thick that no terrible result had really ensued from his words that after they were out had scared him mightily
i'll posts too polly give them here
then his face brightened and he said and she's right polly while polly fished up frank out of jew's little money bag that hung in her belt
do get the stamps pleased jasper and put them on and he took up her two letters and she gave the bag a little pat for jo's sake wishing it was his stubby black hair that her fingers could touch
i don't know where we are going to get nice wit paper for around robin said polly leaning her op on the table and her chin in her hands i know ejaculated tom whirling on his heel and dashing out
i want polly too said phronsie wriggling away from the pen that polly how d alluringly
phronsie who hadn't heard what polly said her small head being full of the responsibility of beginning the important letter and considering since it was to be done it was best to have it over with as soon as possible felt a scribbling a letters as fast as she could all them running down hill
it's all right grandi like it he said
i tell you you don't know my grand daddy he's got lots to fun in him he added
i won't cry any more declared phronsie wiping off the last tear trailing down nose
then i shall be all as well as ever said polly kissing the wet little face
we must put him little pictures said polly tried to make herself cheery as the work went busily on
polly you always do you think of the best things exclaimed jasper beaming at her which made her try harder than ever to smile
i wouldn't feel so badly polly he managed to a spur phronsie was absorbed with her work though ike could probably just his father did the chin bad boy
he seems to accomplished something every time he goes observed jasper dryly hello just look at a nil
oh dear me exclaimed adela as her scissors slipped now you've joggle the table again then she cup polly's eye
rather not much obliged tom bobbed as thanks
picture after picture cut from railroad guide books illustrated papers and it seemed to jasper gathered as if th magic with cunning little photographs broke up the letter and wound and and out with funny and charming detail of some of their journey
the rest of it is nice whispered jasper and a venture to say that h like that the best of all
mister king thought so too and he beamed at phronsie so you did he cried now that's fine i wish you'd write ne a letter some time
but what can i do so small and stupid and shy as i am
i must find some way to give a little ones a nice christmas
telle will like to have me go him and singing while he places harp in the streets
yes i will try and then if i do well will l a one shall have a mary christmas
but see bani is cold in the streets the wind bits in the snow freezes one fingers
she thanked tom and ran await to get ready for she felt sure her father would not release her anything
then she washed out little rance's frock and put it to dry because she would not be able do at the next day
she longed to make the beds and dressed the children over night she was in such a hurry to have all in order but as that c not be she sat down again and tried over all the songs she knew
when she had told her plan peter beni shook his head and thought it would never do botz begged so hard he consented at last that she should try it for one a week and sent her to bed the happiest little girl in ne york
as soon as her father was gone ta flew about and put everything in nice order telling the children she was going out for the day and they were to mind tom was mother who would see that the fire and the diner for the good woman left tessa and entred into her little plans with all her heart
poor tess's heart beat fast as she trenches away with tao who slung his harp over his shoulder and gave her his hand
it was rather a dirty hand but so kind that tessa clung to it and kept looking up at the friendly brown face for encouragement
see now have no fear give them bell monica that is marian will make the laugh whisper tom of tuning his hur
when fat ol french would nodded to her and it seemed to helper very much for she began to sing before she thought and that was the hardest part of it
but tombe shook is curly had and answered soberly yes i took you there first for their love music and hour out our country but up among the great houses we shall not always do well
but she had made half a dollar for tumble divided the money fairly and she felt rich with her share
her hands were covered with chilblains for she had no mittens but she had put them under her shawl and shuffled merrily away in her big boots feeling so gladly the week was over and nearly three dollars safe in her pocket
how gave the streets were that day
how breast g everyone was and howl bright the faces looked as people try it about with big baskets holly wreaths and young evergreens going to blossom into splendid christmas trees
but i can't so ill fill the socks full and be happy said tessa as she looked wistfully into the gay stores and saw the heavy baskets go by
who knows what may ha been if would do well returned tommo nodding wisely for he had plan as well as tessa and kept chuckling over it as he charged through the mid
we'll try one more street and then go home down so tired little one
at the fourth some people at them singing all their songs and gave nothing
tessa felt so grateful that without waiting for tommo she sang her sweetest little song all alone
i'll ask mamma said rose and away she went into the dining room close by
as the door opened test a sal looked to her like a fairy feast all silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine and tall glass pictures and smoking dishes that smelt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfaction
ah yes i shall come with much gladness and play u never in my life before cried too with a flourish of the old cap that made the children laugh
give these to your brother said the fairy prince stuffing nuts and oranges into tess hiss hands
i so tim so very kind i have no way to say thank you but runs i shall be for you a heavenly angel and i will sing my heart out for your tree cried tessa folding the mittens as if she would say a prayer of thankfulness if she knew how
she got up early to see if the socks were all right and there she found the most astonishing sight
four socks instead of three and by the fourth pin out quite elegantly was a little dress evidently meant for her o warm wool and dress all made and actually with bright buttons on it
tessa screamed a danced in her delight and of tumbled all the children to scream the dance with her making ar regular carnival on at small scale
in her long stocking she found all sorts of treasures for tumble had stuffed it full of queer things in his mother had made tinder bed into every imaginable shape from that pigs to full omnibuses
little lun sol was excepted with delight by the kind lady of her children and tess learn the song quite easily
arose from the crowd of children gathered to the festival

the senator took his seat in the pulpit with the minister on one side of him in the superintendent of the sundays school on the other
so aw they by the presence of a living united state senator that during three minutes not a spit ball was thrown
after that they began to come to themselves by degrees and presently the spell was wholly gone and they were reciting verses and poy hair
the usual sunday school exercises were hurried through and then the minister got up and board the house with a speech wilt on the customary sunday school plan then the superintendent put in his oar and then the town dignitaries had there say

then where am i yes where am i
my soul is lost in wonder at the thought
earth has no higher no grander position for me
then what is it what did my consciousness reply
ah think of that now i could hardly keep the tears back i was so grateful
they could not give him a costly education but they were good and wise and they sent him to the sunday school he loved the sunday school
i hope you love your sundays school i see by your faces that you do that is right
always love your teachers my children for they love you more than you can know now
and by and by the people made him governor and he said it was all owing to the sunday school
why the people gave him a towering illustrious position a grand imposing position
it was senator of the united states
that poor little boy that loved his fend a school became not man that man stands before you

welch go was a delightful child
there was know their such child there never had been and there never would be
while chica mother seraph alexandrovna was sure of
loch his eyes where dark and large her cheeks or rosy her lips were made for kisses and for laughter
but it was not these chimes in thella that gave her mother the keenest joy
she felt cold with her husband
he was always fresh and cool with a frigid smile and wherever he passed cold current sink move in the air
it even seemed at seraph my alexandrovna that she was in love with her future husband and this made her happy
the bread was also good looking she was a tall dark eyed dark haired girl somewhat he made but very tactful
he had connections in his wife came good influential people
this might at the proper opportunity prove useful
after their marriage there was nothing in the manner of serio m the stage to suggest anything wrong to his wife
later however when his wife was about to have a child sergeant wostov established connections elsewhere of a light and temporary nature
serpent alexandrovna found the sou and to her own astonishment was not particularly her she awaited her infant with a restless anticipation that swallowed every other feeling
spume alexandr their drifted farther and farther away from him
latch gav ran away stamping with her plump little legs over the carpets and hid herself behind the curtains near her bed
where's my baby girl the mother asked as she looked for l latch kun may believe that she did not see her
then she came at a little farther and her mother as though she had only just caught sight of her seized her by her little shoulders and exclaimed joyously here she is my lola
her mother's eyes glowed with passionate emotion
her mother went to hide
we l ga turned away as though not to see but watch sim much c stealthily all the time
where is mor much ca asked la lack
a smile of absolute bliss played on her red lips
l latch goes getting near her mother's corner
her mother was growing more absorbed every moment by her interest in the game her heart beat with short quick strokes and she pressed even closer to the wall dis arranging her hair still more the
l led cas suddenly glanced toward her mother's corner and screened joy
through the half close doors he heard the laughter the joyous outcries the sound of romping
even fiducia felt abashed now for her mistress now for herself
he liked coming here where everything was beautifully arranged this was done by crema alexandrovna who wished j surround her little girl from her very infancy only with the loveliest things
seraph the elks and dram addressed herself tastefully this too she did for l latch goa with the same end in view
one thing sergey mot esto vich had not become reconciled to and this was his wife's almost continuous presence in the nursery
it's just as i thought i knew that i'd find you here he said with a dur in condescending smile
nearly you see that the child she feeld its own individuality he explained in answer d seraphim that out sandro oa's puzzled plants
shes still so little said seraph thea alexandrovna
i don't insist it's your kingdom here
i'll think it over his wife answered smiling as he did coldly but genially
then they began to talk of something else
that mistress does it while that's one thing but that the young lady does it that's bad
why asked fiducia curiosity
this expression of curiosity gave her face the look of a wood in roughly paint to doll
yes that's bad repeated agatho with conviction terribly bad well
it's the truth i'm saying remember my words a gacha went on that the same assurance and secrecy
it's the carest sign
the old woman had invented this sign quite suddenly herself and she was evidently very proud of it
madam madam she said quietly in a trembling voice
seraphim alexandrovna gave a start
p doc's face made her anxious
what is it fiducia she asked with break concern as there anything wrong with lo latch ca
no madam said fiducia she gesticulated with her hands to reassure her mistress and to make her sit down
the latch cause sleet make god be with her
only i'd like to say something you see will l ges always hiding ourself that is not good
i can't tell you how bad it is said f elsa and her face express the most decided confidence
i understand nothing of what you are saying
you see mat i met a kind of omen explains porcia abruptly and the shame faced way
nonsense said seraphim alex and jog
who told you all this asked seraph ma alexandrovna in a steer low voice
no exclaimed seraph m alexandrovna and irritation as though she wished to protect yourself somehow from the sudden anxiety
what nonsense as though the luka could die
she saw clearly that there could be no a possible connection between the child's quite ordinary diversion in the continuation of the child's life
she made a special efforts that evening to occupy her mind with other matters but her thoughts turned in mound tar lees the fact that will l lech ca lub to hide herself
when the lunch who was still quite small and had learned a distinguished between her mother and her nurse she sometimes sitting in her nurse's arms made a sudden regis grimace and hid her laughing face and the nurse's shoulder
then she would look out with a sly glance
though she reproached yourself at once for this un sounded superstitious dread nevertheless she could not end her wholeheartedly into the spirit l lech ga favorite game and she tried divert will luka attention to something else
she eagerly complied with their mother's new wishes
seraph that alexandrovna tried desperately to amuse volga
perhaps but spa alexandrovna she is not as strongly drawn to the world as other children who attracted by many things
if this iss is it not as signa organic weakness
serve m sandro na herself began the game once or twice though she played it with a heavy heart
she suffered as though committing an evil deed with full consciousness
it was a sad day for seraph m alexandrovna
her mother covered her with a blue blanket
will latch carew her sleet little hands from under the blanket and stretched them m em brace her mother her mother bent down
she seemed so small and so frail under the blinded that covered her
serf alexandrovna remained standing over l lech ga bed a long while and she capt looking at the latch good with tenderness and fear
i'm a mother is it possible that i shouldn't be able to protector she thought as she imagined the various ills that might be fallow lath ca
she prayed long that night but the prayer did not relieve her sadness
several days passed will latch mere cock cold
the fever came upon her at night
when seraphim alexandrovna awakened by psha came to a latch gen saw her looking so hot so restless and so tormented she instantly recalled the evil omen and a hopeless dispirit of possession of her from the first moments
o doctor was called in everything was done that as usual on such occasions but the inevitable happened
and the lunch they grew feebler from hour to hour
nothing made her so unhappy as the reiteration of fiducia uttered between sobs she hid herself and hid herself ilka
fever was consuming rolla and there re times and she lost consciousness and spoken delia
three days past torture in like a night man
sir ema alexandrovna hid her face behind the curtains nearly latch bed how tragic
a wait my march goa whispered l logic
much ga white face became blurred in everything grew dark before lola
she met her husband
spa alexandrovna was standing by the coffin and looking dully at her dead child
sea my dear don't agitate yourself said ser gon loto solving a whisper
you must resign yourself to your fate
she'll be up in a minute persisted serf malea her eyes fixed on the dead little girl
same lot apo looked round him cautiously he was afraid of the unseemly and of the ridiculous
see my don't agitate yourself he repeated
he was confused in annoyed
her face seemed tranquil in her eyes were dry
she went into the nursery began to walk brown the room looking into those places were ll goa used to hide herself
she walked all about the room and then now and bang look under the table or under the bed and captain repeating cheerfully where's my little one where is my loath ca
after she had walked on the room once she began to make her quest in you
fiducia motionless with dejected face sat in a corner and looked frightened o her mistress and she suddenly burst out sobbing and she wailed loudly
she hid herself and hid herself are l latch guy at and jole soul
when she entered the parlour there were several people between her in l latch ga
there was ant oppressive feeling of heaviness and seraphim alex and johns had as she approached lola
will latch go lay there still im pale and smile pathetically
the little one did not reply
ser alexandrovna stood a erect side in a lost way smile and called loudly but latch ga
well much goes being carried out
captain bowl the commander of a small garrison at sabre permitted him to land but when the governor began to read his commission bull ordered him to be silent
what has happened mister prince was worth asked for he could see that the man was greatly excited governor ands was come again guessed mister prince why should that alarm us the fellow they'll get into boasting is not dangerous or liable to pon his threats into execution but he was grown dangerous declared mister prince the liberties of the coloni are involved
captain wadsworth became a little uneasy though he was still inclined to treat the matter lightly
we have surely refused to yield our char of voluntarily for it is the guardian of our political rights
that is true c and wadsworth continued mister prince and to subdue our stubbornness this foy has come to hartford with sixty arm men to demand the surrender of the charter and person
captain wer founded to his feete in a rage and placing his hand on the hilt of the sword declared he shall not have it
the day was well nice spent when he arrives and the members were engaged in a heated debate on a subject of the utmost importance
he consented however to await the discussion but as soon as it was ended he declared that he would have the charter
after that captain had taken two or three turns across the room he paused and asked
what is the assembly doing encaged in de bay
and will he wait until it ins ended he has promised to do so
mister prince twixt amazed eyes on the captain's face and read their a desperate determination captain he again
mister prince bowed and hastily returned to the house toward the assembly was in session
as soon as he was gone charles feed and said
yes charles you will answer but do you mean uncle
never did the bats take greater interest in a minor subject
what do you intend doing uncle will you fight them
remember the worth must be done right at the time not to seem nor to late
the sun was setting and the captain said
come charles let us hasten to the assembly
by no means but i want you to be fully in crest with a seriousness of your mission
take your place charles and be prepared to do your part wh for captain wadsworth
charles god is close to the long table used by the secretaries is possible without attracting special attention
the discussion went on darkness came and flighty candles were place on the table in two set on a shelf on the wall
those two candles on the wall were agreed anoints to charles until and saw a man station near them
though the lights were extinguished through the window the faint starlit dimly illuminated the scene
he followed him as rapidly ass he could
these was cloth behind him and when they were outsides used his arm
oh i had a care how you approach me
the soldiers began the crowd about the house when at a signal from capting wadsworth the train vance came on the scene and prepared to grapple with the soldiers
where is the charter
you have your soldiers at the door and we have the trainbands of communicate ready to defy us against violence
who of you has the charter
it was the boy cringing range governor
every member of the assembly shook their heads
we do not know him he does not living america where does she live
little did the captain or as you full sustain dream that their simple act would make the old tree historic
the tree in which the doin it was hitting was ever afterwards known as as charter oak
it remained the gris bearing fruit every year and tittle a little after midnight august eighteen fifty six when it was prostrated by a heavy storm of wind
when the order from the seizure of the charts was first made known he subtly ro islan sent a most loyal ages to the king sang
he formerly dissolved the assembly broke the seal of the colony which bore the figure of an anchor and the word hope a mine five in the inhabitants into his legislative council and assumed the function of governor but he did not take away the parchment on which the charter was written
from that time until before sonia of the coloni t mutual defense at the bering out of the friends and indian war the inhabitants of rode island or their share in the deferent at efforts especially when the hostile savages hung along their fren of new york like an ill omened cloud
the history is that commonwealth is identified with that of all new england from the beginning of king william's war soon after the expulsion of ands
colbert who had heard his uncle getting ready to run down to the water's edge
it's a schooner said mister bingen to mister mer and she of the very heavy cargo
to this chord was fastened a heavy rope or table
what's that board for asper as he saw board following the teel
that's the directions said how
they are printed in a number of languages and they tell the crew to carry the end of the cable high up to the mast and fastened it strongly there
oh i see said berg the lang will stretch then and the breeches boy will go out on a poly
it was clear day nail and much of the wicked storm had passed
with the daylight king girls of women to the beach
missus bobs missus muttering nearly and her mother besides story at man where all there flossie and freddy being obliged to say home with dinin' susan
of course the girls asked all sorts of questions and burton how tried to answer them as best they could
it seemed the long time before any movement of the cable showed that the boy was returning
nearer and ne eight came until now a man's head could be seen
the girls and woman were too frightened to talk and nelly clung close to her mother
a big roller dashing even finished the work for the lice birds and a man in the coorse felt banded upon shore
everybody gathered around that nellie with a strange face and a stranger hope broke through the crowd to see the rescued man
oh it is my father she screamed falling right into the ears of the drenched man
but the half drew and man rubbed his eyes as if he should not believe them then the next minute he pressed his little daughter to his heart unable to speak a word
and his george bring out there anxiously asked the brother
safe and well came the welcome answer
i guess our prayers were her last night
she had come another man exclaimed the people as this time a big nan dashed on sands
while i declare we did land on a friendly shore
just as mister bingham said th lie saving work turned out to be a social affair for there was a great time greeting nell's father and how's uncle
and how on his father too put in man
what am morning that was it sunset beach
i'm so glad we prayed said little flossy faddy when she heard the good names
a beautiful day had grown out of the dreadful storm
and everybody was so happy
dene the vessel that had struck on the sand fire was now safely anchored near shore and the sailors came in and out in rowboats back and forth to land just as they wished
then we had to go back to work at the logs went on the captain and then one of o crew took a fevers
that was what delta so
finally we had every wall bowed on the schooner and we started off
we can't it on getting home less wee when this last storm struck us and droll out of our horse
boat the value asked mister bobbsey who was down turn the city
the value repeated the captain aside so that the strangers might not hear
while i am a rich man now and so as my mate mc groan for that would was contracted for by the largest and richest piano firm in this country and now it is all but delivered to them and the money in our hands
yes indeed it would have taken us a lifetime to a kim way with much money as we have earned in the yer
nay be a emily will take you down to the city on her shopping toward suggested nan
he made the clerks and move all the trucks from the isles and i guessed everybody was glad the army fell down
the wonderful fresh air that these men lived in night and day had brightened their eyes too so that even the plainest feast and the most award man among them was as nimble as in athlete from his perfected exercise
i don't know how to say good bide you knowing told dorothy and m next morning
oh that will be splendid declared man
you are quite rich now aren't you remarked dorothy
and dorothy went up and daown the room wi the pictures of cinderella's proud sisters
and we will be on hand thank you replied the joking dorothy
come nellie called missus v gluck lan i'm ready where's your hat
we might be able to manage that too nellie told him
my uncles a fireman and he can take us through his engine house
most of them my guess answered berg
well we have had a good vacation and i'm willing to go to work again
so am i declared man vacation was just long enough i think
mister bobbsey was down from the city of course to take the family home and now all hands even freddy and flossy were busy packing up
there were the shells to be looked after the fish nets besides downy the duck and scoop the cat
and so i little friends had spent all the vacation
his characters get joan call gar mad with jealousy or fall an epileptic fits all rave hysterically
if th ser ski had had less vision he would have been stringer
like them he is an novelist of torture
certain with the last of cruelty the lusted destruction for destruction's sake is the most conspicuous of the deadly sins in dust s gives men and women
he may not be a cruel author
but day and ever in balance they are always in demon could conflict
even the last is never hardly ever the lust of a mor or less same man
dost sky could not have describe the soon of nelson
this is a madhouse cries someone in thei
one resulted this is a multiplicity of action
even the talk is all actions more than o ideas
he saw his violent deeds not with the hand but with the suck
but one had noticed during this last two days that the other was wearing a silver watch on a yellow bade chain which he seems not to have seen on jan before
he took a knife and when his friend had turned away he approached him cautiously from behind took aim turned his eyes heavenwards crossed himself and praying fervently gods forgiven for crass sake
he never paints everyone he always projects dost tsi or a night marrow dos hev sky
that is why crime in punishment belongs to a lower range of fiction than ancren or fathers and sons
we sympathize indeed with the fears the bravado that despair that succeeded the crime
he is a grotesque made alive by she imaginative intensity in passion
one does not grudge an artist and abnormal character or two
he invent vicious greatest as dickens invents comic greatest
was very fond of hanging cuts and burying them with great ceremony
as for the cream is ov themselves he betrays the old farther and the oldest of his sons hating each other in fighting like brutal maniacs
serve him right shouted to meet breastless
if i haven't killed him i'll come again and kill him
it is easy to see why dost yet ski has become a popular author
no melodist ever poured out incidents upon the stage from such a horn of plenty
do skies always ready to show them all in at once
on two opposite pages of the idiot one finds the following character brought in by name general a puncheon prince s ad lider ivanovna lizaveta procopius you have genie peublo rich redon ski princess bo quinsy a gayer prince miskin coal vulgar ippolit valuer fir decker masts philipovna nina alexandrovna guna distant and general l vulgar
but the secret of dost skies appeal is something more than the multitude and thrill of his incidents and carters
mister marry boded faces are difficulty and attempts of definition
to him disk's work is the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life it is more than a record of a struggle it is for struggle itself
and those voices ta shape in certain unforgetable fragments of dialogue that had been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly in the in tavern certain surrounding darkness
ultimately they other creations not of a man who desired to be but of a spirit which sought to know
because they have possessed they are no longer man and women
this is all in i measured true
to say this is not to deny the spiritual content of dust dusk is work the anguish of the imprisons souls at battles with doubt and denial and despair
there is in dusky a suggestion of caliban trying to discover some better god than sir tables
the ultimate attitude of dust ski is as christian is the apostle peters lord i believe helped them light unbelief
and beyond the dark night of suffering and dissipating the night go ski still seized a light of christian compassion
or even by the compassion of others like prince miskin in the idiot
his work luck his face bears the mark of this terrible conflict
the nobles of the perfect image of the man
as to the man himself the vicomte deal gay described him as he saw him in the last years of his life
when he became excited on a certain points one could have sworn that one had seen him before seated i bent a police court awaiting trial or among baa boons who passed their time begging before the prison doors
at all other times he curried that look of sad and gentle meekness seen on the images of old staving saints
thus a portrait of the men one sees behind doc's novels the portrait one might almost have inferred from the novels
it is a figure that at once fascinates andrew pels
he is not by temperament a sinner
his music is a still small of west unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and storm
truth to tell mister hardy is near the sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet
he does not express life easily in beautiful words or an images
thus he writ in i found her out there of one who
there could not be an ugly and more pres could saturation this contained in the image in the lastline
and prosing ties in the choice of words as well as in images
take for example the use of the word domiciled in the passage in the same pal about
when we is strangers sought their catering care bailed smiles b spoke their thought of what we were
catering care is in appalling phrase
is a line of good poetry
you did not come and marching time drew on and war me numb yet lost for loss of your dear presence there then that i thus fan lacking in your make that higher compassion which can overbear reluctance for pure loving kindness sake greed die when is the hope stroked it sun you did not come
there a hens of the grand style of l rich poetry in these lines but pass look in youll make and as the hope hour stroked it some a discords that bread tumbling to the levels of victorian commonplace
he has a temperament sensitive beyond that of all but a fur recent writers to the pain and passion of human beings
one can remember pul after poem of his with a theme that might easily have serves for mister hardy too late christina the lost mistress the last ride together the statue and the bust to name a few
but what a sense of child there is in brownings tragedies
his world as a place of opulence not a poverty
to have loved them for an hour is with browning to live forever after in the inheritance of a mighty achievement
to have loved for an hour is in mister hardy's imagination to have deepened the sadness even more than the beauty of one's memories
for then i u distressed by hearts growing cold to me could lonely wait my end wass rest with equanimity
but time to make me grieve part steels lets part abide and shakes this fragile frame and eves with throbbings of mean tide
and despair by no means triumphant in what is perhaps the most attractive of all mister hardy's poems the oxen
you pictured the ma mile creatures where they dwelt in miss jury pen nor did it occur to one of us there to doubt over kneeling then
the mot of feat however or rather of delight in the memory of feet is not mister hydes prevailing mood
he can enter upon a wall without already gal darts as we see in the song men who march away
how long he cries in a pole wen some years ago
when shall the senor softer politian where of the dream have sway in each proud land and patriotism grown god lack scorned to stand bon slave to realms but circle earth and seeds
but perhaps his characteristic attitude to wars to be found not in lines like these but in that melancholy poem the souls of the slain in which the souls of the dead soldiers returned to their country in question a senior sole flame was to h their friends in relatives have kept their doughty deeds in remembrance
and general hel hold out her sweethearts sworn royal as doves
some fickle and fleet hearts found in new loves
and our wives que another resignedly d they on our deeds
mister hardy has tree bitter a sense reality to believe much in the glory of war
the farewell to mister hardy is the world of ancient human things in which war has come to be a hideous ere elevates
it may be thought it on the other hand that mister hardy's poems about war i no more expressive of tragic futility that his poems about love
futility in frustration are ever re caring seems in booth
his lovers lug his soldiers wrought in the great defeated of their glory
lovers are always savored both in life and in death
in beyond the last lamp we have the same mournful cry over severance
no shade of pinnacle a tree or tower while earth and jaws will fallen my mound and within the hour still unto yours one wer never haunted a two green coverts
they bring his face to face with an experience intenser that alone

they had not much to say as they knew that they were force
and by this act recur our sols as well
for whether inde state men would have been mow oman
therefore in the state of innocence man had no mastership of the animals
therefore in the state of innocence before men had it spade nothing dis bated that was naturally subjected to him
secondly dis prove by the oder of divine providence which h was governs in beery things by the super
certainly this is proved from a property man and bather animals
now what avers part pated is subject to what is essen shall and iver so
therefore to subjection of other animals to man is proke to be natural
they now h her on this come have been accepted from mastership of men as neither at press nor d for their reason accepted from the mastership of god was providence has m dens
this is signified by the fact that god led it they animals to men that he might gave the names expressive that their respected natures
so all animo was would have a bit men of the own court as in the presents days some domestic animals obey him
objection one it was seem that inessa ness ins man would not have had mastership over all other creatures
much l therefore will have a bad man in the state of distance
therefore since it is by this reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems feeding the stent l in since man had l been in
now a m reason has the position of the master and not of a subjects
i answer that we must me omit that in a primitive state there would have been some inequality at least as regard sex because generation depends upon dags dive sex and likewise as regards age for some would have been born of others nor would sere un he had been
there might also have been bodily disparity
the cory miles were rise on the parts of nature as bove described without any defect of nature
objection one he will sein that instead offn sence man would not have be ms over men
therefore in the state of innocence now not have been subjected m
in other sins mastership is referred in a general sends to anchor of subject and in this sense even pave has the office of governing and directing free men can be cut master
such a con of mastership would have existed in the statham between man and men for two reasons
but in the stead vincent there would have been l w ness fal age
on the contrary everything generated inspiring perfects but inca innocence children happy begot by generation
therefore from the first they would happen in perfect in bov au size and power
therefore in the state of innocence there was no need for women to be born on the contrary natures process in generation the happen in hon with never in which it was established by god
i have been told that mister van brandt is in pison for debt i said
and i saw my self last night that he had left you hopeless

his cruel creditors and more to blend and he is for the poverty that has fallen on us
even this negative defense of and ban stung me to the quick i ought to have spoken wore guardedly up him i said bitterly
i ought to have remembered that a woman can forgive almost any wrong than a man can inflict on her when he is a man whom she loves
she put her hand on my mouth and stopped me before i could say any more
how can you speak so cru to me she asked
you know to my shame i confess it to you the last time we met you know that my heart in secret is all yours
what wrong are you talking of
is it the wrong i suffered when there brat married meat with a wife living at the time and living still
do you think i can ever forget the great misfortune of my life the misfortune that has made me unworthy of you
it is no fault of mine god knows but it is not the less true that i am not married and that the little darling who was playing out there with her doll as my child
and you talk of my being your wife knowing that the child accepts me as her second father i said
it would be better and happier for us both if you had as little pride as the child pride she repeated
in such a position as mine
they helpless woman with a mock husband in prison for debt
am i to marry you for my food and shelter
and i to marry you because there is no lawful tie that bins me to the father of my child
that is he is he is not forsaken me he has been forced away
my only friend is it possible that you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife
the woman in my situation must be heartless indeed who could destroy your place in the estimation of the world in the regard of your friends
though wretchedest creature that walks the streets would shrink from treating you in that way
no what are men made of
how can you how can you speak of it
i yielded and spoke of it no more
everye word she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom i had loved and lost
bitterly as i hated the man who had parted us i loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake hopeless infatuation
i don't deny it i don't excuse it hopeless infatuation you have forgiven me i said
let me deserve to be forgiven
it is something to be your only friend
you must have plans her the future tell me unreservedly how i can help you
complete the good work that you have the gun she answered gratefully help me back to heal
make me strong enough to submit to a doctor's estimate of my chant su of living for some years yet
a doctor's estimate of your chances of living i repeated what do you mean

why we you hesitate
you know that there is nothing i will not do to relieve your anxiety
never let me tell you the plain true
there is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison
yes this is his position in two words a little while sence he obtained an excellent offer pointing abroad from a rich relative of his and he had mad all his arrangements to accept it
unhappily he returned to tell me of his good fortune and the same day he was arrested for debt
this merrit that had been set for her was plainly revealed in those war words
in the eye of the law she was of course a single woman she was of age she was to all intense and purposes her own mistress
what was there to prevent her of from insuring her life if she pleased and from so disposing of the insurance as to give vampa a directs interest in her death
thinks to the happy a exeter of my position th one certain way a protecting her lay easily within my reach
i could offer to leet the scoundrel the money that he wanted at an hour's notice and he was a man to excep my proposal quite as easily as i could make it
you are quite mistaken i replied
i am only doubting whether you plan for relieving mister van bu of his embarrassments is quite so the simply he supposed
are you aware as it delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to burr money in you policy of insurance
i know nothing about it she said sadly
will you let me ask advice of my lawyers
they are trust where the unexperienced men and i am sure they can be o use to you
cautiously as i had expressed myself her delicacy took the alarm
promise that you won't ask me to bottle money of you for mister van brandt she rejoined and i will accept to help gratefully
i could honestly promise that
my one chance of saving her lay keeping from her knowledge to course that i had now determined to pursue
i rose to go while my resolution still sustained me
kissed me she whispered before you go
it is only your goodness that overpowers me

d'artagnan uttered a welcome full of pleasure when he perceived his friend's son
