as i approached a city i heard bell's winging and the later i found the streets to stir with throngs of well dressed people in family groups winding their way hither and thither
looking about me i saw a gentleman in meat black dress smiling and his hand extent int to me great cordiality
he must have razed i was a stranger and wished she tendered his hospital to me i accepted it gratefully i clasped his hand he pressed min
we gazed for am s lightly to eh eyes
of course you are going there too i said to my friendly guide
yes he answered i cannot the worship i am a priest
and idle i whispered taken by surprise
they worship god they did not exist
but the greeks love their gods i protested my heart clamly my breast
no i said in a low voice
he was an idle then and not a god
it made a and to sea of light he created the beautiful the true the goods yes o religion was divine
it had only one fought interrupt in my guide what was that
i inquired without knowing what his answer would be it was not true
produce him
i wm to myself what blasts form me
then taking heart i told my guide how more than once i had felt apollo's grading at presence in my heart and hold him of the immortal lines of homeward concerned the divine apollo
do you doubt homer
i said to him homer the inspired barred
no no apollo is mile
he is a got and a son of a god
the air was heavy with incense a number of men and caroused vestments were passing to and fro thou in a kneeling before the various lights and images
observing lings to understand the mean of all this my guide took me side and in a whisper told me that a pop were celebrating the anniversary of the birth the other beautiful saviour jesus the son of god
forget apollo he said with his digestion of severing his voice
there is no such person he was only an idle
if you would assert for apollo and all the universe who would never find e when answering too his name were description
i want do he jesus i hasten turning toward him
will he not be here this morning
will he not speak to his worshippers i asked again
will he not permit them to touch him to caress his hand to class was divine feet to hell the em bal fragrance of his breath to bask in the golden lid of his eyes to hear the musick of his immaculate accents
i asked my eyes fee with wondering my voice quivering with excitement
would not that then i vented to ask impatiently make uses as much of an idle as apollo
and it faith that jesus is a god prism god while will not faith in apollo make him a god
but i am determined not only you know if it is possible the whole truth about jesus but also to communicate that truth through others
but there is more of a moral tonic in the open and caned discussion of a subject like the one in hand then in the multitude of platitudes
i never del live e lecture in which i do not either directly or indirectly if full and free spress into my faith and everything that worthy of faith
if i d do not believe in darm is because i believe in freedom

as intelligent beans would desire to nowhere this jesus whose wor sheh was not only cost in the world millions of the people's money but which is also drawing to his service the time the energies the affections the devotions and the labor humanity is a myth or reality
a number of other dayes were observed with a crean church of various times as the birthday of jesus the gos was give no date and appear to be quite uncertain really
yet there is no evidence that he was born on that day
why this discrepancy historical document you say nothing aboute inspiration
again matt he says that to escape that evil to signs of herr marian joseph with the infant jesus flat into egypt loops is nothing about this hurry flight nor of hero's intention to kill the infant messia

if we are to have any theology at all he seems to ague why object to adding too it the ms of jesus
the immediate companions of jesus appear to be on anther hand as mythical as he is himself
who was matthew it was mark
who were john peter jude and merry
there is actually no evidence that they ever existed
if peter every went to rome with the new doctrine hows it that no historian has taken note of him
here again we see the presence of am
he was the only one who saw them
peter paul john james jude i'll keep o the stage almost exclusively
it is impossible to explained while the contemporaries of jesus the authors in the historians of the time you not take notice of him
c they have been in a conspiracy against him
how is his unanimous sides be accent for
how then are we to decide which the a numerous cannes for divine honored should be human our votes
and such a faith is never free it is always maintained but a sword now and by hell fi hereafter
yet the most impossible utterances our put indued mouth
only am mythical jesus could virtually hand over the goverment levers to carters who have petitions to press upon his attentions
moreover g jes could keep his promise there would be to day no misery in the world no orphans no childless mothers no shipwrecks no floods no famines no disease no crippled children no insanity no wars no crime no wrong
have these prayers been answered
how me self to led prophets these extravagant claims have produced
and who can number the bitter disappointments caused by such impossible promises
the same w a preachers of to day give he parried his hands with many words in at length said that the promise was we taken with the provision that will we asked for would be given if got thought it for our goods
but he said if he as he thing in my name i will do it and if it were not so i would have told you
did he not mean just what he said
self effort and not prayer is a really against ignorance slavery poverty and more degradation
it was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sensed in congruity when with impressible persons love becomes sol sisters ness hope sins to misgiving and faith to hope when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at opportunities for ambition that had been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise

her tired lakes could not propel the tant body rapidly
the go saw the boat nearing her
in a moment more the boat was on her and the man at the os had leaned over and cut her
i was tormented by thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctor's orders
that old man seized to give so much annoys yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams
phi e had i g even them orders not to speak to me of this
this made had stolen from me certain little sings of some importance and in her fear being defect it she would have been veryain glad if i had died
accordingly she al me twice to take as much ass i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask fool i than cove myself and began to sweat and fell into a deeps sleep
they see that my poor friend was on the point of falling to the ground so graved was he to hear this
afterwards he took an ugly state and began to beat the serving girl with all his mind shouting out ahhh treacherous you have killed him for me then
she may did have saved my life so led mea helping hand for i have sweated and be quick about it

i answered no because i had entirely pointed my thirst
in like manner she was asking for what she wanted when the poor young men bag do to bleed him
if you knew his be recovery depend upon his drinking two flasks of water why did you not say so before
you might then have boasted of his kill
at this words the wretched qui sulkily departed and never showed his face again
the very evening i was taken with great precautions in a chair well wrapped up and protected from the cold
do not permitting and the irregularities for though he h escaped this time another disorder now would be the death of him
that he turned to me and said my van val be prudent c min no excesses and when you are quite recovered i dago make me a mad with your own hand and i will always pay my devotes tor it for your sake
so i made my mind up and prepared to treble
that day many friends came to see me among others pierre lady who was the best e dearest friend i ever had
next day that came a certain nicolo monte ago who was also a veryain great friend of mine
i had harboured him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house up site down for the man was subjects to a species of dry scab which he was always in the habit of scratching with his head
meanwhile that abble physician francs go the montes vari attended to my cure with great skill
there they sit at me to wait until the duke red by
many of my friends at court came up to greet me and expressed surprised that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shuttered by illness the set that i ought to have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke
at this words my augustino the dukes tailor made his way through all those gentleman and said it that's all you want to know you shall know it at this veryain moment
george is a painter whom i have mentioned happened just then to pass and my sere augustin exclaimed there is the man will accused you now you know yoursel if it be true or not
as fy as i could not being able to leave my seat i asked george if it was true that he had accused me
he denied that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sword
my sere augustin not retorted you gallows bird
don't she you know that i know it for most certain
george made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me
then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he haled
the duke gazed at me and marvel i was deal alive afterwards he v we take he to be an honest man and regain my hells
when i reached home nicolo da mont a gr came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin witting with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards tick french leaf because my jap came from a quarter and a man who able to destroy be me
i answered that i had done nothing to displeasing but that he had injured me and told him all the affair ab the mein
he repeated it get hens as quickly as you can and be off good' courage for you will see of vengeance executed sooner than you expected
i the bestest attention to my hells gave pier thro pale advice about that thing the coins and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else
you want them to immortal that ferocious tyrant
you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you i inveterate foe and there devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice a mind to hang you without any fault of yours
it was firmly believed that duke al sad rough was the sun of pope clement
miser francesco used also to say and swear by all he saints that if he could he would have robbed me of the dies for that meadow
i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more
i thou send to florence to request lorn senor that he would se me the reverse of the meadow
nicolo dar mont tale gr to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher lord see not for it it he had replied he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better event one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bringing it without hesitation to the duke for this would be to my advantage
i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate and pressed the world forward to my best ability
this being soul as he was a fellow of much humour we used offered to laugh together about the great credit he had gain
i therefore dismounted at once got my flinging pee ry and at a veryain long range brought two of them downed with a single ball
i never used to shoot with more th one ball and was usually able to hat my mark at two hundred cubits which cannot be done by other ways of loading
i lived at my foot and let the water run out then when i mounted we made haste for rome
we have succeeded in amassing two hundreds ounces of silver enough i trust to erect a handsome bronze figure
to be sure it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priest is boasting about i could live it ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compasses purpose
but the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrades thoughts journey cheerfully on till they reached the town of cana
here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in fairy boats that started soon as some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked
when the boatmen a passengers heard the splash saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made everye effort to save him but the wind was fair and the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundreds yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him
when he saw this the room famed the utmost grief in dismay it said to his fellow passengers this priest whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron and as i happened to have business there is well we settled to travel together
now last by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone
he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believed a story im pitied and tried to comfort them
then the run and said to the boatman
what thank you gentleman added he turning to the og travellers
they of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to there onward journey and all with one voice agreed to what the run and had proposed and so the matter was settled
when at length they reached this shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the r it o overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priest luggage and putting it with his own pursued his journey to ka
fortune favoring his speculations he began to a mass great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself nothing and in the course of time he married a wife who bore him a childs
since then allay gone well was me yet had i not been poor i had never turned to sassin nor thief
he would have fled into the house but the go stretched forth its withered arm and clutching the back of neck scaled at him with a vindictive glare and a hideous ghastliness of mean so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear
at length undone by such ceaseless vexation took bay fell ill and kept muttering oh misery misery the wandering priest is coming to torture me
now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest to lodged in the next street
and hiding his head under the cover let he lay quivering all over
three years ago had the coon a fairy you flung me into the water and well you remember it
happily continued the priest i had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so i reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded and setting up a bon figure to buda thus fulfilling the wish of my heart
on my journey homewards i took lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvelous ailment
thinking i could divine its cause i came to see you and am glad to find i was not mistaken
and wouldn it not ill become me to bar malice
repent therefore in abandon your evil ways
to see you do so i should esteem the height of happiness
be of good cheer now and looked me in the face and you will see that i am really living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you
and a fit of madness i was tempted to kill and babel
fortune be friend it me ever after but the richer i grew the more keenly i felt how wicked i had been and the more i fore saw that my victims vengeance with some day overtake me
haunted by this thought i lost my nerve till one night i beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill
but how you manage to escape in her still alive is more than i can understand
a guilty man said the priest with a smile shudders at the rustling of the wind were the chattering of a stork speak a murder's conscience praise upon his mind till he sees what is not

on the day after the death often in the evening the body must we placed in the casks shaped cough u that until recently was a style commonly uns in japan
now among the wealthier classes the longed coffin has superseded the small square or round one but the smaller expense connected with a burial in the old way makes his survival of an old typee u necessity for the majority of japanese
at an appointed time all the relatives assemble in the death chamber and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse
there's no official ceremonial morning of parents for their children nor does custom required them the perform any of the last rights or attend the funeral
upon the younger brothers and sisters falls the duty of attending to all the last sad ministrations
when the body has been washed as as dressed in white in sil cabo time whenever the family can ford it
the body to be placed in the coffin must be folded into a sitting posture the chin resting upon the knees the positions of the mummies found in many aboriginal american tombs
this difficult to us apparently impossible feet safely accomplished there are placed in the coffin in number of small things that the dead takes with him to the nest world
the single exception to this rule about mettle is that small comer coins may be putt to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death
last of all the vacant spaces in the coffin are filled in with bags of tea
so long as the coffin is in the house it must be watched over continually
it is their duty to see that the incense burning before the coffin is never allowed to go out while the food for the dead were new regular intervals by the mourners themselves
there are few and lighten japanese who will defend the present system of cruelty to the afflicted or who do not long for some change but so great as the force of conservatism in this regards so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack of respects the dead that reformed advances slowly
individual instance h occurring which some of the worst features of these customs are modified
a case and point is that of the late mister fuca ovah a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countryman in modern ways and who in his death continued his teaching
in his will he provided that his body was to be buried without washing in the clothing in which he died
through this growing feeling and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies
just before the processions starts or relig ceremony as held at the house which is attended by the friends of the deceased and which is substantially the same of that performed at the cemetery
on the day of the burial great bunches of natural flowers are sent to the dead each bunch so large as to require the services one man to cary it
sometimes with it gift a man is sent to take parting the possession but if the giver feels too poor to higher a man this burden too falls upon the braved household for et requires that all flowers sent beat borne to the grave by uniformed coolies whom march and the funeral train
another favour present at this time among buist is a cage of living birds to be borne to the grave th were leased there on
it seems more like a bri o than a burial
dinging this period the spirit of the deceased is supposed to be still inhabiting the house and a tablet her shine is set up in the death chamber before which food and flowers are renewed daily

she was a common street drunkard and yet the services of the tent were his impressive as any i ever witnessed and a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen
it struck me of course being a stranger in the place with considerable astonishment to hear voices like those one naturally expects to hear only in great churches or concerts at such a meeting as this
mister max well spoke at the fact that the dead woman had been fully prepared to go but he spoke in a peculiarly sensitive manner of the effective the liquor business on the lives of man in wen like this one
raymond of course being a railroad town and the center of the great packing interests for this region is full of s wins
then followed what was perhaps the queer part of the strange service
it was one of the simplest and at the same con one of the most impressive sties i ever witnessed

yet so strong was the effected upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectation of the wood which should make him rich
a part of that impression was due to the engagement which he must nowt fulfill
to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes
because in his sell days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many chance step step here had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that roar attachment
unable to think of work he left the house and wandered glumly aboute jan's park
he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marian who was fates instrument
he wrote to mara

i scarcely thought of beforn likely to kill himself
but why that coos did he go all the way out there

you don't notice any falling off my work recently
do you see my things in the current and so on generally
sometimes i believe i have detected you when there was no signature
her storing at that girl's paper has attracted attentions
and i could so easily put her of rest by renouncing all plain upon her
i surmise that that you yourself would also be put a rest by such a decision
john or g at me with that ironical smile he pleaded
i couldn't do about declaring that i was hearken in any of int i must be content for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgements of pretty sure to be young favorable what can i do
the cases too delicate i fear for my advice
well i'll g back to my scrip
again just beheld the white softe for a super moment
yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the rep made him angry
marian could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companions smooth countenance
she had divined that there was some grave reason for this sums and the ping with which he approached was half caused by the anxious beats of her heart
he began abruptly
he gave her such details as he had obtained then added
there are two of my companions fallen in the battle
i ought to think myself a lackey fell mary what
you are better fitted to fight your way jasper

you feel yourself indispensable to your father at present
i should be so afraid of e effected upon his health jasper
she paused and looked up of him touchingly
dea i can't feel it would be my duty to renounce she because my father had become led
has one thing occur to you
will he consent to receive in allowance from a person whose name is missus milby
and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him
she listened to anxiously and reflected
as i have said there is a veryain serious dle when ther father would accept money for you when you will more wife
it isn't your fault marion and well then there' only one thing to do
except jasper that he father is helpless by must find means of assuring his support
do you think them insurmountable
that is just for i have decided it is impossible m you shall have the plain truth
i don't trust myself
but shall you faced them willingly
put up yourn bal marian
what do i care for a drop of rain she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is it stake how am i to understand you
everye word you speak seems intended to disheartened me
why needed you conceal if that is the truth
is that what you mean by sign you distrust yourself
we must see each other agave marian
how a i to live an hour in such uncertainty this
i do wish it
her emotion had an effected on him and his voice trembled
there is no natural law but child should se reread to everything for her parents

this they no way of providing for my father
good god this is frightful marion i can't stand it
i will be faithful to you
he had made a pretense of holding his ap over her but mari and turned away and walked to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a grat tree her face averted from him
moving to follow he saw that her frame was shaken by soundless sobbing
in what can they be more selfishness
but i couldn't say on word that would seemed to invite such misery as this
you don't love me jasper and that's an end of everything
happiness o misery come top fight
is if h my pent to make you happy
but if you m had said you loved me before that i should have it always to remember
if i believe anything i believed that i did love you
what can you say to me more than you have said now
remember me as a man who disregarded priceless such as yours to go and make himself a proud position among fools and knaves indeed that one it come toy
soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merit it might verse pride would revolt against it
what can be simply of th the truth
it is a thing of happens everyday either in a man or woman and all would on a demands is the courage to confess the truth
marian we he do this will he let her engagement last for another six pons not without her meeting during that time
that seems to me childish
the rain fell unceasingly and with it begin to mingle un or tumor mist
jes but delayed a moment then asked calmly
are you going to the museum yes
go home again for this morning marian you can't work
i must and i have no time to lose
goodby she gave him her hand
they looked at each other for an easton then marry him left the shelter of the train opened her umbrella and walked quickly aw
jasper did not watch her he had the face of a man who is suffering aha humiliation
his sister said very little for she recognised genuine suffering in his times and aspects
of fear wigs ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest defection but who is very rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him
yester no morning he received her final answer i refusal
you will understand they surely you needed no fresh proof how utterly unworthy he is of you
you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you
several days past before their came a reply
i must only asked that you will write to me without the least reference to these troubles tell me always about yourself and be sure that y you cannot tell me too much

several diffrent parties were therefore organized to examine the various routs suppose to be practicable with in the northern hend southern limits of the united states
the only discriminations made was in the more probed and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all surveyes

the officers of these regiments were chosen partly bys selection from those already in service in the regular army and partly by pint from civil
under instructions from the president the lest was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geograpical distribution
after some further discussion of the questions the visors withdrew dis satisfied with the result of the interview
the quartermaster general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake and the appoint to the office had been confounded with his father who was a well known wig but that heat the sun was a democrat
i assured the general that this was all together immaterial adding that it was a very pretty quarrel as it stood and that i had no a desire to effects a settlement of it on any inferior issue
nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the fox hound avery much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size
if you want to hunter your hors on foot sixteen inches quite pig enough almost to big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches as a useful heigh or even nin hues
it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule asked color it is so much a matter out c individual taste
but puppies are usually sent out to walk and may easily be procured to be captain reared until their old enough to be hindered to their work
he as of course finer but with the lengths of neck so perfect in the bigger hound the little shoulders of the same pattern and the tib cope quarters pen second fins
and when he is fairly on a line of course he stick to it as the saying is like a beagle
it is quite possible therefore that the ble was crossed with the welch southern or otterhound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of goods eighteen inches canon almost at dental contemporary that was called the essex beagle
that a great many of the true order were bread became very manifest as soon as the harrier and bega associations was formed and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hou show was reserved for

all things which followed from the absolute nature of any attribute of god must always exist and be infinite or in other words are each carnal pen infinite through they said attribute
proof conceive if it me possible supposing the proposition to be denied that the something in sal attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of these said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought
in its nature infinite
must necessarily exist
le have now grated therefore thought not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of god does not naturally follow from its nature can so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of goot which is against our oaths
and bey on the limits of the duration of the idea of god supposing the latter at some time not to have existed for not to be going to exist thought would perforce have existed without the idea of god which is contrary to our hypothesis for we suppose that thought being given the idea of godness early flowed their from
bearing mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from god's absolute nature
clary hans it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is is ins colic phraseology god is cause of the being of things as sandy rm
clary individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of god or modes by which the attributes of god are expressed in a fixed and definite manner

that is why crime in punishment belongs to a lower range off fiction than ancona or fathers and serves

mister marry boarded faces the difficulty and attempts of definition
to h dost ask his work is the record of a great mind seeking for away of life it is mores in a record of a struggle it is the struggle itself
and those voices take shape and certain unforgetable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly me in tavern set in surrounding darkness
ultimately they other creations not a man who desired to be but of a spirit which sought to know

there is justa sky a suggestion of crab trying to discover some better god than sir tables
the ultimate attitude of dust sky is as christian as the apo peters lord at belie helped them might un belief

at all other times he curried that look of sad and gentle meekness seen on the images of olds devon sinks
thus a portrait of the man one sees behind aster usk novels the portrait when might almost have inferred from the novels
it is a figure that at once fascinates and repels
he is not by temperament singer

truth to tell mister hardy is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet
he does not expressed life easily in beautiful words are or images
thus he writ in i found her out there of one who
there could not be an ugly and more pres cons suguration this contained in the image in last line
and pros injuries in the te of words as well as in images
take for example the us of the word domicile in the passage in the same palm about

one can remember pal to pul of his with the seen that might easily have served for mister hardy too late christina the lost mistress the last ride together the statue in the bust to name a few
but what a sense of child there iss in brownings tragedies
his world as a place of opulence not of poverty
to have loved for an hour is with browning to live forever after in the inheritance of a mighty achievement
to have long for an hours is in mister hardy's imaginations to have deepen the sadness even more than the beauty of one's memories

mister hearty has tre bitter sensibility to believe much in the glory of war

it may be thought on the other hand that mister hard is ponds about war i no more expressive the tragic futility than his ponds about love
