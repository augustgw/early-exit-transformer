as i approached a city i heard bells ringing and little later i found the street to stir with throngs of well dressed people in family groups winding their way hither and thither
looking about me i saw a gentleman in a neat black dress smiling and his hand extended to me with great cordiality
he must have realized i was a stranger and wished he tendered his hospitality to me i accepted it gratefully i clasped his hand he pressed on him
we gazed for a moment slightly into each other's eyes
of course you are going there too i said to my friendly guide
yes he answered i conduct the worship i am a priest
an idle i whispered taken by surprise
they worshipped god they did not exist
but the greeks loved their gods i protested my heart clamly my breast
no i said in a low voice
he was an idol then and not a god
it made athene sea of light he created the beautiful the true the good yes our religion was divine
it had only one fault interrupted my guide what was that
i inquired without knowing what his aunts would be it was not true
produce him
i wish me to myself what blas for me
then taking heart i told my guide how more than once i had felt apollo's grading at presence in my heart and told him of the immortal lines of homer concerned the divan apollo
do you doubt homer
i said to him homer the inspired bard
no no apollo is not an idle
he is a god and a son of a god
the air was heavy with incense a number of men in gorgeous vestments were passing to and fro thou in a kneeling before the various lights and images
observing my anxiety to understand the mean of all this my guide took me aside and in a whisper told me that the people were celebrating the anniversary of the birth the other beautiful savior jesus the son of god
forget apollo he said with his digestion of severity his voice
there is no such person he was only an idol
if he would assert for apollo and all the universe would never find e one answering to his name or description
i won't you see jesus i hasten turning toward him
will he not be here this morning
will he not speak to his worshippers i asked again
will he not permit them to touch him to caress his hand to class was divine feet to in held the ambrosial fragrance of his breath to bask in the golden light of his eyes to hear the music of his immaculate accents
i asked my eyes feel with wondering my voice quivering with excitement
would not that then i venture to ask impatiently make uses as much of an idle as apollo
and if faith that jesus is a god pris him a god why will not faith in apollo make him with god
but i am determined not only to know if it is possible the whole truth about jesus but also to communicate that truth through others
but there is mar of a moral tonic in the open and candid discussion of a subjects like the one hand th in the multitude of platitudes
i never to live re lecture in which i do not either directly or indirectly if full and free expression to my faith in everything that is worthy of faith
if i do not believe in dogma is because i believe in freedom
oh he tears down but hes not build up is another chrism about my work it is not true
no preacher a priest is more constructive
clasping truth in jail yegg in the mouth of the student is that building up or tearing down

i wish to tell you something
the first less be impersonal the epithets irreverent blasphemer atheist and infidel are strung in a man not from pity but from envy
not having the courage or the industry of our neighbor who works like a busy bee in the world of men and books searching with the sweat of his brow for the real bread of life whether the open page afore him with his tears pushing into the wee hours the night his quest animated but fairest of all loves the love of truth we ease our own indolent conscience by calling him names

let us place ourselves entirely the hands of the evidence
as intelligent beings would desire to know where this jesus whose works was not only cost in the world millions of the people's money but which is also drawing to his service a time the energies the affections the devotions and the labor humanity is a myth or reality
a number of other dates were observed with a christian church of various times as the birthday of jesus the goss was give no date and appeared to be quite uncertain really ignorant about it
yet there is no evidence that he was born on that day
why this discrepancy an historical document to say nothing about inspiration
again mattie says that to escape the evil designs of herod mary and joseph with the infant jesus fled into egypt loops h nothing about this hurried flight nor of herod's intention to kill the infant messiah
when we come to the more important chapters about jesus we meet with quitter difficulties

the pagan osteria has become a christian easter
but in the actions of evidence or in offers a following metaphysical arguments against this epical senses one
if we are to have any mythology at all he seems to argue why object to adding to it the midst of jesus
the immediate companions of jesus appeared to be on other hand as mythical as he is himself
who was matthew who was mark
who were john peter judas and mary
there is absolutely no evidence that they ever existed
if peter ever went to rome with the new doctrine hows it that no historian has taken note of him
here again we see the presence of a myth
he was the only one who saw them
peter paul john james judas i'll keep out the stage almost exclusively
it is impossible to explain why the contemporaries of jesus the authors in the historians of this time you not take notice of him
could they have been in a conspiracy against him
hows is his unanimous size be accounted for
how then are we to decide which the numerous candidates for divine honors should be human our votes
and such a faith is never free it is always maintained but a sword now and by hell far hereafter
yet the most impossible utterances are put in juice mouth
only a mythical jesus could virtually hand over the government levers to corners who have petitions depress upon his attention
moreover if jesus could keep his promise there would be today no misery in the world no orphans no childless mothers no shipwrecks no floods no famines no disease no crippled children no insanity no wars no crime no wrong
have these prayers been answered
how me self deluded prophets these extravagant claims have produced
and who can number the bitter disappointments caused by such impossible promises
the same wis a preachers of today give he parried his aunts with many words and at length said the promise was be taken with the provision that what we asked for would be given if god thought it for our good

did he not mean just what he said
self effort and not prayer is a really against ignorance slavery poverty and more degradation
it was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity when with impressible persons love becomes solicitous ness hope sinks to misgiving and faith to hope when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret and opportunities for ambition that have been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise

the shape went slowly along but without much exertion for the snow though sudden was not as yet more than two inches deep
at this time some words were spoken aloud one

margaret was repairing her mother's worsted work and all the shrinking from the thought of the long evening and wishing bedtime would come that she might go over the events of the day again
margaret

very serious to a soul
mister lennox had never had the o pity of having any pointed conversation with a father after her refusal or else that would indeed a very serious affair
but she soon felt it was not about anything which having only lately and suddenly occurred could have given rise to any complicated thoughts and her father wished to speak to her
mister hale did not answer for a mere dot
margaret could not bear the sight of the suspense which was even more distressing to her father than to herself
but why dear papa do tell me
because i must no longer be a minister in the church of england
but nothing to the shock tree received on mister hale's last speech what could he mean
it was all the worse for being so mysterious

margaret i will tell you about it
we answer any questions this once but after tonight let us near the speak of it again
i can need the consequences of my painful miserable doubts but it is the effort beyond me to speak of what has calls me s m suffering
no not doubts as to religion nor the slightest injury to that he paused
margaret's sighed as if standing on the rage of summing horror

as he read this and glance at much more which he did not read he gained resolution for himself and felt as if he too could be brave and firm in doing what he believed to be right but as he ceased he heard margaret's low convulsive sob and his courage sang down under the keen sense of suffering
i have borne long with sou reproach they would have roused any mind less tor b and cowardly than mine
he shook his head as he went on
margaret i cried to do it i cried to content myself as simply refusing additional prevalent and stopping quietly here stranding my conscience now as i had strained it before
god forgive me
he rose and walk up and down the room speaking no words of self reproach and humiliation on which margaret was thankful to hear but a few

margaret did dislike it dicing from it more than from anything she had ever had to do in her life before
mister hale shook his head despondingly he pressed her hand in token of latitude
margaret was nearly upset again into a burst of prime
to durn her thoughts she said now tell me papa what up mana

margaret was all the stand

not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed and his son's handwriting
on receiving it he ran on tiptoe to his study and alarm and haste trying to escape notice closed the door and began to red letter
each time that these hens began to meet the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at anna mihalovna the latter very adroitly turned to conversation to insignificant matters
but for god's say be careful you know her it may affect your mamma

natasha smiled through her tears

sonya smiled do i remember me clus
i remember nikolinka too i remember him well she said

she felt that sonya was speaking the truth that there was such love as sonya was speaking of
she believed it could be but did not understand it
shall you write to him she asked
n that he was already an officer and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of herself and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had taken on himself
i don't know
sonia smiles no
it's because she was a log without fat one his spectacles that was her picture descry his namesake the new co bezukhov and now she's in love without singer he met natasha's italian singing master that's why she's ashamed
petya you're stupid said natasha
the countess had been prepared by aemi clo's heads at dinner
on retiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuff box while the tears kept coming into her eyes
the coats pretty ear to the keyhole and listen
at first he heard the sign of indifferent voices then an mihalovna's voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silence then both voices together with glad intonations and then fruit steps
ann mihalovna opened the door
when she heard this sonya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and unable to bear the looks turned upon her ran away into the dancing hall were old rounded at phil speeded with her dress puffed out like a balloon and flushed and smiling plumped down on the floor
the comtesse was cry
from all he says one should be glad and not cry
how charmingly he described said she reading the descriptive part of the letter and what a soul

the pavlovsk grounds held feast after feast celebrating awards they had received for the campaign and made expeditions to all moods to visit a certain carlin the hungarian who had recently opened arst on there with girls waitresses
the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading their cleanliness and discipline
the regiments had entered and left a tone with their bands playing and by the grands orders the men had marched all the wee in step a practice on which the guards prayed themselves the officers on footer pulse
boris had been corset and had marched all the way with berg who was already in combin of a company
boris during the campaign had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become acquainting with prince andrew bolkonski though whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in chief stuff
berg and boris humming rested after yesterday's march were sitting clean and neatly dressed at a round table in the clean quarters lotted to them plain chess
well how are you going to get out of that he remarked
at that moment door open
dear me how you have changed
he was about to embrace his friends but nicholas avoided him
he wanted to pinch him push him do anything but kiss him a think everybody did
but notwithstanding their space embraced him in a quiet friendly we and kissed him three times
they had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when young meant their first steps on lige roads each saw immense changes in the other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken was fir steps
i did not expect you to be he added
you know of course that his imperial highness wrote with our regiment all the time so that we in every comfort and every advantage
what receptions we had in polands
what dinners and balls i can't tell you
o you guard said rostov i say surface a wine
he went to his bed drew apart them under the clean pillow and sent for wine
yes and i have some money in o letters to give you he added
i'll don't mention it codes i quote understand said berg getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice
gore cross d arcs they invited you added boris
berg put on the keenest of courts without a spot or speck of dust stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and having insured himself from the way rostov looked at it that his court had been noticed left the room with a pleasant smile
oh dear what a beast i are muttered rostov as he read a letter why
well have you sent gabriel for some white all right les house
in the letter from his parents was enclosed the letter of recommendation to bagration which the old countess at ana mihalovna's advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to take it to his destination and make use of it
why have you thrown that away asked boris
is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want it for
he looked intently un inquiringly into his friend's eyes evidently trying in ving to find the answer to some question
which you believe it coat i was not at all alarmed cause i knew i was right
i came forward berg stood up and show how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self complacency than his did
well he stormed at me as the saying is stoned and stormed and stormed
it was not a matter of life but rather of death as the same is
albans and devils and two siberia said berg with a sagacious smile
still i remain silent of what do you think coat
the next day was not even mentioned in the orders of the day
that's the we coat said berg lighting his pipe and emitting lings a smoke
yes i was faints rostov smiling
rostov with a truthful young man and wow no account have told a deliberate lie
he began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened that imperceptibly involuntarily and inevitably he elapsed into falsehood
prince andrew who liked to help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed towards boris who had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what young man wanted
this spate of prince andrew's disagreeable ironical ton in spit of the contemn with which rostov from his fading army pointed view regarded all the little adjutant on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently won rostov fell confused blushed and became silent
ors inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without indiscretion one may ask about our plans
we shall probably advance replied bolkonski evidently reluctant to see more in the presence of a stranger
burnt at the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as which remote the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled
i was stir said rostov angry as if intending to insult e de camp
with a slightly contemptuous smile he said yes that im many stories now told them at that afar
but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy's fire
our stories have some wheat not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get re wars without doing anything
however he added rising you now my name and were to find me we don't forget i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted and as a man order than you my advices to let the matter drop
exclaimed prince andrew and was bo to them both he went out
and he was still more angry at having omitted to see it
he ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave a bors rode home
should he go to headquarters next and challenge that affected adjutant or really let the mit of drop was the question that wei him all the wee
icy sure some departed and not perhaps is out an annabel hing too to greet the island along with ashby knobs

eugenius would never admit this and would often tell him that one day or rosea he would certainly be reckoned with and he would often add in an accent of sorrowful apprehension to his uttermost bite

and say not one word unto me unless i speak first unto thee
i will do as far as i can lord said she according to die desire
i made said he at is vain to a temper seating forward
i cannot by any means refrain from sleep through weariness said he do thou therefore wash the horses and sleep not
and when she saw the donner day appear she looked around her to see if he were waking and thereupon he woke
and they left the wood and they came to an open country with meadows on one hand and mo was mowing the meadows
my lord he added will be displeasing to bee if i ask whence thou comest also
wilt thou foul my counsel said the you can take thy meal for me
what sort of meal he inquired
then they washed and took their repast
i go now lord said he to meet the night and to conduct him to his lodging
i will do lord said she as thou sayest
and after they had eaten and drank drain went to sleep and so did it also
the date seem unam point but throw the period the offices and men of the ship have been unremittingly busy
bows attacked the ship's stores surveyed re listen rested them saving very much space by unstoned and stowing the contents in the lazarette
without steam the leak can now be kept under with the hand pump by two daily efforts of a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes
as the ship was and in her present heavily late in condition would certainly have taken three to four hours each day
the large green tent was put up and props supports made forward
the anteroom staff and ants people on the engines scientists was stowing their laboratories the cook refitting his galley and so worth not a single spot but had its band of workers
the man space such as it is therefore extends from the fore hatch the stem on the main deck
under the forecastle of stalls of fifteen ponies the maximum the space would hold the narrow irregular space in fronts packed tight with fodder
neatly behind the forecastle vol cad is a small booby hatch the only enterest to the men's mess deck and bad weather
about the four hatch is the ace house
we manage to get three tons of ice one hundred sixty two caucasus of mutton and three cockades of beef beside some box of sweetbreads and kidneys into this space
the sax containing this last added to the goods already mentioned make a really heavy deck iago and one is naturally anxious concerning it but everything that can be done by lashing and securing has been done
forage i originally ordered thirty tons of compressed oaten hay from melbourne
the scene is wholly enchanting in such a view from some sheltered sunny corner in a garden which blazes with masses of red and golden flowers tends to feelings of inexpressible satisfaction with all things
a great mass of people assembled
kay i lunch with a party in the zeal and company ship r
telegram to say ter nova had arrived sunday night
a third sledge in across the break of the poop in the space hitherto occupied by they after w
the quantities to in half tons and the space occupied considerable
the ship was over two feet by the stern but this will soon be remedied
they must perforce be chained up and they given what shelters afforded on deck but their position is not enviable
it is a pathetic attitude deeply significant of cold and misery occasionally some poor beast ams a long pathetic wine
there are generally wanted two on watch which ease matters but it is a squash
later in the day the wind his vid to the westward heading us slightly
oates and atkinson with intermittent assistance or others were busy keeping the ponies on their legs
there was nothing for it but to grapple with the evil and nearly all hands were labouring for hours in the weights of the ship heaving coal sacks overboard and re lashing the petrol cases et cetera and the best man i possible under such difficulty and dangerous circumstances
no sooner with some semblance of order restored than some exceptionally heavy way would tear away the lashing and the work had be done all over again
from this moment above f a m the ino became the centre of interest
the water gained his spite of every effort
the outlook appeared grim
the amount of water which was being made with the ship so roughly handled was most uncertain
williams had to confess he was beaten it must draw fires what was to be done
the built pomps depended on the main engine
on one occasion i was wast deep and standing on the rail of the poop
the after god were organized in two parties by evans to work buckets the men were kept steadily going on the choked hand pumps this seemed all that could be done for the moment and what a magic account as the soul safe got of the ship from sinking practically an attempt to bil her out
occasionally a heavy sea would bear one of them away and he was only saved by his chain
the farm had taken this morning meal and now lay crawled up on a bed of moss
whenever the fawn cut up he was quite contented to frisk about
the danger was certain now it was near
the hows had struck a twel where she turned and the fawn was save
one was rolling the other had a gun in his hand what should she do
her tired lakes could not propel the tant board rapidly
the gat saw the boat nearing her
in the moment more the boat was on her and the man at the oars had leaned over and cut her
i was tormented my thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctor's orders
that old man ceased to give so much annoyance yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams
pilcher given them orders not to speak to me of this
this maid had stolen from me certain little things of some importance and in her fear being dejected she would have been very glad if i had died
accordingly she allowed me twice to take as much as i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask full i then covered myself and began to sweat and fell into a deep sleep
they say that my poor friend was on the point of falling to the ground so graved was he to hear this
afterwards he took an ugly date and began to beat the serving girl with all his mind shouting out ah traitress you have killed him for me then
she mayan did have saved my life so led me a helping hand for i have sweated and be quick about it
folia recovered his spirits dried and makee me comfortable and i been conscious of a great improvement in my state began to reckon on recovery
just then the other doctor bernardino put in his appearance who at the beginning of my illness had refused to bleed me
my trenches calls that most able man exclaimed oh power of nature
she knows what she requires and the physicians know nothing
that simplon mice rubber nino made uns saying if he had drunk another bottle he would have been cured upon the spot
afterwards he turned to me and asked if i could have drunk more water
i answered no because i had entirely pinched my thirst
in like manner she was asking for what she wanted when the poor young man begged you to bleed him
if you knew that recovery dependent upon his drinking two flasks and water why did you not say so before
you might then have boasted of his kill
at these words the wretched qui sulkily departed and never showed his face again
the very evening i was taken with great precautions in a chair well wrapped up and protected from the code
do not permit him any irregularities for though he has escaped this time another disorder now would be the death of him
then he turned to me and said my ban venal be prudent commit no excesses and when you are quite recovered i beg you to make me a madonna with your own hand and i will always pay my devotions to it for your sake
so i made my mind up and prepared to travel
that day many friends came to see me among others pierre lardy who was the best a dearest friend i ever had
next day that came a certain nicolo da monte auto who was also a very great friend of mine
i had harboured him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house upside down for the man was subject to a species of dry scab which he was always in the habit of scratching with his head
meanwhile that able physician francesco da monte vari attended to my cure with great skill
there they seated me to wait until the duke went by
many of my friends at court came up to greet me and expressed surprise that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shattered my illness this said that i ought to have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke
at this words myra agostino the duke's taylor made his way through all those gentlemen and said if that's all you want to know you shall know it at this very moment
george a painter whom i have mentioned happened just then to pass and myra agostino exclaimed there is the man who accused you now you know yourself if it be true or not
as fiercely as i could not being able to leave my seat i asked georgia if it was true that he had accused me
he denied that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sword
myra augustino retorted you gallows bird
don't you know that i know it for most certain
georg made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me
then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted
the duke gazed at me and marvelled i was still alive afterwards he bade me take he to be an honest man and regain my helth
when i reached home nicolo da monte grotto came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin written with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards take french leaf because my jap came from a quarter and a man who was able to destroy me
i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had endured me and told him all the affair about the mint
he repeated get hens as quickly as you can and be of good courage for you will see your vengeance executed sooner than you expect
i the best attention to my health gave piero bag lo advice about stamping the coin and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else
you want them to immortalizes that ferocious tyrant
you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you i inveterate foe and their devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mine to hang you without any fault of yours
it was firmly believed that duke alessandro was the son of pope clement
master francesco used also to say and swear by all his saints that if he could he would have robbed me of the dies for that meadow
i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more
i down sent to florence to request lorenzo that he would send me the reverse of the meadow
nicolo da montagu to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher lud sey not for it he had replied he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better event one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bring it without hesitation to the duke for this would be to my advantage
i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate impressed the word forward to my best ability
this being so as he was a fellow of much humor we used often to laugh together about the great credit he had gained
i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling peas ready and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball
i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to hit my mark at two hundred cubits which cannot be done by other ways of b loading
i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we made haste for rome
we have succeeded in amassing two hundred ounces of silver enough i trust to erect a handsome bronze figure
to be sure it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priest is boasting about i could live at ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose
but the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrades thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of cana
here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in faery boats that start as soon as some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked
when the boatmen a passengers heard the splash and saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made every effort to save him but the wind was fair and the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him
when he saw this the room feigned the utmost grief in dismay and said to his fellow passengers this priested whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron and as i happened to have business there as well we settled to travel together
now alas by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone
he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believed a story i pitied and tried to comfort him
then the roan and said to the boatman
what thank you gentlemen added he turning to the egg travellers
they of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to there onwards journey and all with one voice agreed to what the ran and had proposed and so the matter was settled
when at length they reached the shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the ran overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priests luggage and putting it with his own pursued his journey to kiote
fortune favouring his speculations he began to amass great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself nothing and in the course of time he married a wife who bore him a child
since then allays gone well with me yet had i not been poor i had never turned assassin nor thief
he would have fled into the house but the ghost stretched forth its withered arm and clutching the back of his necks scowled at him with a vindictive glare and a hideous ghastliness of mean so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear
at length undone by such ceaseless vexation took bay fell ill and kept muttering o misery misery the wandering priest is coming to torture me
now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest who lodged in the next street
and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all over
three years ago at the cana faery you flung me into the water and well you remember it
happily continued the priest i had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so i reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded in setting up a bronze figure to buddha dus fulfilling the wish of my heart
on my journey homewards i took a lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvelous ailment
thinking i could divine its cause i came to see you and am glad to find i was not mistaken
and would it not ill become me to bear malice
repent therefore an abandon your evil ways
to see you do so i should esteem the height of happiness
be of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that i am really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you
in a fit of madness i was tempted to kill and bobo
fortune befriended me ever after but the richer i grew the more keenly i felt how wicked i had been and the more i foresaw that my victim's vengeance would some day overtake me
haunted by this thought i lost my nerve till one night i beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill
but how you manage to escape in her still alive is more than i can understand
a guilty man said the priest with a smile shudders at the rustling of the wind or the chattering of a stork speak a murderer's conscience praise upon his mind till he sees what is nu
every well ordered jap his home with the old fashioned kind has its little shrine which is the centre of the religious life of the house

these must be kept carefully by the mother is is safeguard against the many evils that beset child life
visits to noted temples by relatives and friends often result in additions to the child's collection
all these are put together by the careful mother and preserved as jealously as queen alba kept the charred stick that governed the destiny of her son
as the children arrived at years of discretion these treasures pass out of the mother's faithful keeping into the hands of their actual owners and there usually kept scored away in some little used drawer or cabinet until death removes the necessity for any further safeguards over life
each animal brings its own kind of good or bad luck into the hour day or year over which it presides and only a skilful balances or prose and kinds can read on write the combinations and understand what the luck of any particular hour in any particular day of any particular year will be
for the greater events of family life the home prophesies are felt to be too uncertain whom this services of the fortune teller must be called him
no well managed family would think of building a new house without finding in what direction to pace the front door
after this manner has been settled in the houses fairly begun there are occasional crises in its construction upon which much depends
of these the most important as the day when the ruth is raised
the house owner then beside whether the days set by the builder is a lacking one for himself and his family
a present of money to each workman is also in order and will conduce to the rapid and faithful execution of the job of man when at last the house is finished in carpenters and plasterers already to leave that the local fireman who have assisted all along in the building is unskilled laborers often ascend to the roof and from the ridgepole cast down cakes for which the children and the neighborhoods scrambled joyfully
all come who can and those who cannot come sin servants provisions
on the day after the death often in the evening the body must be placed in the cask shaped cough a net until recently was a style commonly amusing japan
now among the wealthier classes the long coffin has superseded the small square or round one but the smaller expense connected with the burial in the old way makes a survival of an old type a necessity for the majority of japanese
at an appointed time all the relatives assemble in the death chamber and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse
there is no official ceremonial mourning of parents for their children nor does custom require them to perform any of the last rights or attend the funeral
upon the younger brothers and sisters falls the duty of attending to all the last sad ministrations
when the body has been washed as is dressed in white in sil cabo tine whenever the family can informed
the body to be placed in the coffin must be vaulted into a sitting posture and the chin resting upon the knees the position of the mummies found in many aboriginal american tombs
this difficult to us apparently impossible feet safely accomplished there are placed in the coffin in number of small things that the dead takes with him to the next world
the single exception to this rule about metal is that small copper coins may be put in to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death
last of all the vacant spaces and the coffin are filled in with bags of tea
so long as the coffin is in the house it must be watched over continually
it is their duty to see that the incense burning before the coffin is never allowed to go out while the food for the dead is renewed regular intervals by the mourners themselves
there are few enlightened japanese who will defend the present system of cruelty to the afflicted or who do not long for some change but so great as the force of conservatism in this regard so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack of respect for the dead that reform advances slowly
individual instance is occurring which some of the worst features of these customs are modified
a case in point is that of the late mister fucus area a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countrymen in modern ways and who in his death continued his teaching
in his will he provided that his body was to be buried without washing in the clothing in which he died
through those growing feeling and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies
just before the procession starts a religious ceremony is held at the house which is attended by the friends of the deceased and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery
on the day of the burial great bunches of natural flowers are sent to the dead each bunch so large as to require the services one man to carry it
sometimes with the gift a man is sent to take part in the possession that if the giver feels too poor to higher a man this burden too falls upon the bereaved household for etiquette requires that all flowers sent be born to the grave by uniform coolies whom march and the funeral train
another favorite president this time among buddhists is a cage of living birds to be born to the grave and released thereon
it seems more like a bridle than a burial
during this period the spirit of the deceased is supposed to be still inhabiting the house and a tablet or shrines set up in the death chamber before which food and flowers are renewed daily
he tarried at gen shore a few days and came up to garda where i then resided he was apparently without any business that would support him but he soon became acquainted with my son thomas with whom he hunted for a long time and made his home with him at my house winter came on and he continued his day
the enraged husband well knowing that he should feel a blow if he waited to hear the order repeated instantly retreated and went down to river to his cattle
we protected the poor man cope woman and gave her victuals and allan sympathized with her in her misfortunes display when her husband came to her acknowledged his former lents and that he had abused her without a cause for mister reformation and she received him with every mark of renewal of her affection

my sin thomas went with them with allan's horse and call eat the good
allen on finding that his enemies had gone came back to my house where he lived as before but of his return they were soon notified at niagara and nettles who married priscilla ramsay with the small party of indians came on to take him
nettles at length abandoned the chase went home and allen all in bats came in
by running in the woods his clothing had become tone into rags so that he was in a suffering condition almost naked
alan made his rouses himself and then built a raft on which he went d the river to his own place at mont maris
there an indian gave him some refreshment and a good gun with which he hastened on to little beards down where he found his core
not daring to risk himself at that place for fear of being given up he made her but a short visit and came immediately to gard
the love of liberty however added to his natural swiftness gave him sufficient strength to make his escape to his formal castle of safety
his pursuers came immediately to my house where they expected to have sound him secreted and under my protection
still unsatisfied and doubting my veracity they advise my indian brother to use his influence to draw from me the secret of his concealment which they had idea that i considered of great importance nor only to him but to my says i persisted in my ignorance of his situation and finally they left me
he came to my house in the night and awoke me with the greatest caution fearing that some of his enemies might be watching to take him at a time when and in a place where it would be impossible for him to make his escape
at that time allen lay in a secret place in the gulf a short distance above my flats in a hole that he accidentally found in the rock near the river

he could well conceit so much to her caprice since her staying at home could be no disadvantage to the cause that had prompted him to the stern counsel
it is already known that this road passed the hacienda of casa del corvo at some distance from the house and on the opposite side of the river
on reaching the corpse he dismounted let his horse in among tho underwood hitched him by looping his brighten rain around the topmost twigs of any lasting bow then detaching a long rope of twisted horsehair from the horn of his saddle and inserting his arm into its coil he glided out to the edge of the island on that side that lay towards the huss yander
be four forsaking the shadow of the corpse he cast a glance towards the sky and at the moon sailing supremely over it

the church bells were ringing and people on the avenue going by to service turned curious inquiring looks up at the great house and then went on talking with the recent events which had so strangely entered into and made history in the city
and all through his impassion appeal this morning there was a note of sadness and rebuke and stern condemnation that made many of the members pale with self accusation or with inward anger
raymond had voted to continue for another year this saloon
the christians of blame and stood condemned by the result
for that had been the fact in raymond for years the saloon ruled
president mars s there his usual erect handsome firm bright self confident bearing all gone his head bowed upon his breast the great tears rolling down his cheeks unmindful of the fact that never before had he shown outward emotion in a public service
what if he had begun to do as jesus would have done long ago
when had the first church yielded to such a baptism of tears
what had become of its regular precise conventional order of service undisturbed by any vulgar emotion and unmoved by any foolish excitement
they had been living so long on their surface feelings that they had almost forgotten the deeper wells of life
the meeting was tender it glowed with the spirit's presence it was alive with strong and lasting resolve to begin a war on the whisky power in raiment that would break its reign for ever
since the first sunday when the first company of volunteers had pledged themselves to do as jesus would do the different meetings had been characterized by distinct impulses or impressions
and all through it ran one general cry for deliverance from the saloon in a towle curse
grey and his wife were besieged by inquirers who wanted to know what loreen's friends and acquaintances were expected to do in paying their last respects to her
grey had gone up to virginia's and after talking it over with her and maxwell the arrangement had been made
i am and always have been opposed to large public funerals said grey whose complete wholesome simplicity of character was one of its greatest sources of strength but the cry of the poor creatures who knew loreen is so earnest that i did not know how to refuse this desire to see her and paid her poor body some last little honor what do you think mister maxwell
i will be guided by your judgment in the matter
i am sure that whatever you and this page thank best will be right
under the circumstances i have a great distaste for what seems like display at such times but this seems different
it happened that that afternoon a somewhat noted newspaper correspondent was passing through gammon on his way to an editorial convention in a neighboring city
she was a common street drunkard and yet the services of the tent were as impressive as any i ever witnessed and a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen
it struck me of course being a stranger in the place with considerable astonishment to hear voices like those one naturally expects to hear only in great churches or concerts at such a meeting as this
mister maxwell spoke at the fact that the dead woman had been fully prepared to go but he spoke in a peculiarly sensitive manner of the effect of the liquor business on the lives of men and women like this one
raymond of course being a railroad town and the center of the great packing interests for this region is full of saloons
then followed what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service
it was one of the simplest and at the same time one of the most impressive sights i ever witnessed
there must have been a hundred of these women and i was told many of them had been converted at the meetings just recently
there was no answer and after one or two ineffectual attempts fansie turned fearfully away
i'll try and she lid a quick on theon
two red spots burned on her cheeks and her pale blue eyes snapped
i'm sure i heard it raging up and down
i don't want any dinner said charlot drawing back
yes indeed said polly cheerily just as fine as can be
assuredly said old mister king with great satisfaction in polly's pleasure and at her success enjoying charlotte how
and after this there were no more quiet days for charlotte chatterton
oh bess me too phronsie in pleased surprise
yes grandpapa said phronsie coming in and shutting that are carefully i came on purpose to see you all along
so you did dear said mister king highly gratified and pushing away his writing table he held out his hand
oh no grandpapa cried phronsie in rapture i could never be to big for that so she perched up as of old honest name then she folded her hands and looked gravely in his face
well my dear what is it
asked the old gentleman presently you've come to tell me something i suppose
yes grandpapa i have said pony decidedly and it is most important too gad papa oh i do wish it so much and she'd clasped her hands tighter inside
well then phronsie if you wanted i suppose it must be said mister king quite as a matter of course
oh she left you everything she had phronsie a pupa of millions or so it is why
charlotte poor repeated the old gentleman
why no not exactly her father is rich but charlot i think they do very well especially as i intend to keep her here for a while and then i shall never let her suffer phronsie never indeed
grab paa said phronsie wasn't missus chatterton aunt to charlotte
if missus chatterton was aunt the charlotte persisted phronsie slowly it seems as if charlotte ought to have some of the money it really does grandpapa
maybe said the old gentleman with a short laugh and i shouldn't wonder if cousin une was sorry over a few other things too phronsie
wouldn't it make her very glad if i gave shall that some of the money
for answer mister king set her down hastily on the floor and took two or three turns up and down the room
oh i do so wish i might she said there so much for a little girl like me
it will be so nice to have charlotte half some with me still no answer
i was widing a note to missus fargo said phronsie putting up her lips for kiss
sure as i can be phronsie said old mister king smiling good bye dear
there there my sister's boy she'll never say that but come in come in
not to be ungracious the young manly himself into a chair
oh hang it uncle why can't you let me alone
which is a wonder interpolated pickering
i know you did uncle said pickering you've done everything that's good
for heaven's sake picker and cried his uncle darting in front of the chair and its breastless ought to don't say that again
i've been a lazy dog all my life and good for n but i hope i've not sunk to that
the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous fresh of a starry eyed flush cheeked young woman who demanded
where is he pete miss billy gasped the old man
aunt hanna's cheeks too were flushed and her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way pete had said miss billy's name
it was one matter for her to object to this thing billy was doing but quite another for pete to do it of course it's she
retorted aunt hannah testily as if you yourself to bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night pete where is he
interposed billy tell mister bertram i'm here or wait i'll go right it in surprise it
pete had recovered himself by now but he did not even glanced toward aunt hannah
miss billy miss billy you're an angel straight from heaven you are you are oh i'm so glad you came
it'll be all right now all right he's in the dad miss billy
billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall aunt anna's indignant voice arrested her billy stopped
pete go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receive us pets lips twitched
but his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke
a flying figure brushed by him and fell on it seized by the couch with a low cry bertram's eyes flew open
don ling found him there minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over bertram's tray
in the hall above aunt hannah was crying into william's gray w and duster that hung on the hall rack aunt hanna's handkerchief was on the floor back at hillside
then very gradually it dawned over them that there was after all something strange and unexplained it at all
as if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closer bertram was so thankful that he cid have one arm that was usable
why oh of course stammered billy i couldn't help thinking that maybe you had found out you didn't want me
demanded bertram angry and mystified
as for my not painting again you did' understand pete deary
she pulled herself half away from bertram's en circling arm
billie your quivering sigh
good heavens is kate and this too bertram's voice was savage now
well she wrote a letter
billy laughed gaily but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes
and you never did think for a minute billy that you cared for him
he had not been slow to mark that swift lowering for eyelids
billy was so glad bertram had turned the question on her love instead of arkwright's
after a minute billy stirred in sighed happily
you see i wasn't in love with mister arkwright
and and you didn't care it spec she'll be for from miss win up
billy put a soft finger on his lips
bertram kissed the finger and subsided humph he commented
well what is that is that kate too demanded bertram grimly
there was another silence then suddenly bertram stirred
billy i'm going to marry you to morrow he announced decisively
i don't know as i can trust you out of my sight till then you'll read something or hear something or get a letter from kate after breakfast tomorrow morning that will set you saving me again and i don't want to be saved that way
i'm going to marry you tomorrow i'll get he stopped short with a sudden frown confound that law i forgot
five days indeed sir
i wonder if you think i can get ready to be married in five days
don't want you to get ready retorted bertram promptly i saw marie at ready and i had all i wanted of it
if you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace ruffling will do it afterwards not before but
besides i needed you to take care of me cut in bertram craftily
the tender glow on billy's face told its own story and bertram's eager eyes were not slow to read it
sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm
billy my dear
it was aunt hanna's plaintive voice at the doorway a little later
we must go home and william is here too and wants to see you
you mean it'll be before october
aunt hannah glanced from one to the other uncertainly
yes nodded billy demurely
yes i know that is a good while cut in bert marly
we wanted it tomorrow what we had to wait on account of the new license law
yet so strong was the effect upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectation of the word which should make him rich
a part of that impression was due to be engagement which he must now fulfill
to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes
because in his salad days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many charms step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that raw attachment
unable to think of work he left the house and wandered gloomily about legions park
he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marian who was fate's instrument
he wrote to marian
will you let me hear or come and seem
i scarcely thought of bean as likely to kill himself
but why that deuce did he go all the way help there
i hoped he would bring me subdues
poverty i can only suppose
but i will see weal down i hadn't come across biffin for a long time
was he still so merry poor
asked amy compassionately
i'm afraid sigh his book failed utterly
oh if i had imagined him still in such distress surely i might have done something to help you
perchance his death was in part attributable to that hopeless love
he sent me a copy of his novel she said and i saw him once or twice after that
having this subject to converse upon put the two more quickly at east than could otherwise have been the case
amy might take a foremost place among living women
especially now that her father is threatened with blindness
is it so serious
even if mister yule recovers his side it is not at all likely that he will be able to work as before
our difficult is a so grave that
he paused and let his hand failed despondently
i have a good deal of will you remember and what i have set my mind upon no doubt i shall some day achieve
there were psalms
the last three years he continued have made no slight difference in my position
recall where i stood when you first knew me
just now i am in need of a little encouragement
you don't notice any fling off at my work recently
did you see my things in the current and so on generally
sometimes i believe i have detected you when there was no signature
her storing at that girl's paper has attracted attention
and i could so easily put her of rest by renouncing all plain upon her
i surmise that that you yourself would also be put at rest by such a decision
jon look at me with that ironical smile he pleaded
i couldn't go about declaring that i was heartbroken in any event i must be content for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgments are pretty sure to be unfavourable what can i do
the case is too delicate i fear for my advice
well i'll go back to my script
again just beheld the white soft hand for a superfluous moment
yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry
baron could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companions smooth countenance
she had divined that there was some grave reason for this sums and the paining with which she approached was half caused by the anxious beats of her heart
he began abruptly
he gave her such details as he had obtained then added
there are two of my companions fallen in the battle
i ought to think myself a lucky fell i marry what
youre better fit him to fight your way jasper
more of the great remain
here no very well i don't
i have made up my mind about our affairs he went tom presently
yes
will you marry them and let us take their chairs
you feel yourself indispensable to your father at present
i should be so afraid if the effect upon his health jasper
she paused and looked up at him touchingly
dear i can't feel it would be my duty to renounce you because my father had become blind
has one thing occurred to you
will he consent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is missus norway
and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him
she listened anxiously and reflected
as i have said there is a very serious doubt whether your father would accept money for you when you were my wife
it isn't your fault marian and well then there's only one thing to do
except jasper that if father is helpless i must find means of assuring his support
do you think them insurmountable
that is just what i have decided is impossible marion you shall have the plain truth
i don't trust myself
but shall y face them willingly
put up your un bella marian
what do i care for a drop of vain she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is at stake how am i to understand you
every word you speak seems intended to dishearten me
why need you conceal if that is the truth
is that what you mean by saying you distrust yourself
we must see each other again marian
how am i to live an hour in such uncertainty as this
i do wish it
her emotion had an effect on him and his voice trembled
there is no natural law but a child should surrender everything for her parents
you know so much more of the world that i did can't you advise me
do that no way of providing for my father
good god this is frightful marian i can't stand it
i will be faithful to you
he had made a pretence of holding his umbrella over her but marian turned away and walked to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a great tree her face averted from him
moving to follow he saw that her frame was shaken by soundless sobbing
in what can there be more selfishness
but i couldn't say on word that would seem to invite such misery as this
you don't love me jasper and that's an end of everything
happiness or misery come to us by a fight
is if in my power to make you happy
but if you had said you loved me before that i should have it always to remember
if i believe anything i believe that i did love you
what can you say to me more than you have said now
remember me as a man who disregarded priceless love such as yours to go and make himself a proud position among fools and knaves indeed that when its come to
soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merited my perverse pride would revolt against it
what can be simpler than the truth
it is a thing that happens every day either in a man or woman and all honor demands is the courage to confess the truth
marianne will you do this will you let her engagement last for another six months but without her meeting during that time
that sins to be childish
the rain fell unceasingly and with it began to mingle an autumnal mist
jasper laid a moment then asked calmly
are you going to the museum yes
go home again for this morning marian you can't work
i must and i have no time to lose
good bye she gave him her hand
they looked at each other for an instant then marian left the shelter of the train opened her umbrella and walked quickly away
jasper did not watch her he had the face of a man who was suffering a severe humiliation
her sister said very little for she recognised genuine suffering in his times an aspect
a few weeks ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest affection but who is very rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him
yester d morning he received her final answer by refusal
you will understand they surely you need no fresh proof how utterly unworthy he is of you
you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you
several days passed before there came a reply
i must only ask that you will write to me without the least reference to these troubles tell me always about yourself and be sure that you cannot tell me too much
we had then but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of the covenant which was requisite for determination of the problem
several different parties were therefore organized to examine the various routs supposed to be practicable within the northern and southern limits of the united states
the only discrimination made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the surveys
he inquiries were made with regard to good powder which subsequently led to the use of a coarser grain for artillery
the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil wife
under instructions from the president the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution
after some further discussion of the question the visitors withdrew dissatisfied with the result of the interview
the quartermaster general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake at the appointing to the office had been confounded with his father who was a well known wig but that he the son was a democrat
i assured the general that this was altogether immaterial adding that it was a very pretty quarrel as it stood and that i had no a desire to effect a settlement of it on any inferior issue
nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the foxhound a very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size
if you want to hunt your hairs on foot sixteen inches is quite big enough almost too big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches as a useful height or even nineteen inches
it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule asked color it is so much a matter of individual taste
but puppies are usually sent out to walk and may easily be procured to be captain reared until they are old enough to be hindered to their work
he is of course finer but with the length of neck so perfect in the bigger hound the little shoulders of the same pattern and the typical quarters and second fives
and when he is fairly on a line of course he sticks to it as the saying is like a beagle
it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otterhound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of good eighteen inches and an almost identical contemporary that was called the essex beagle
that a great many of the true order were bred became very manifest as soon as the harrier and beagle association was formed and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hound show was reserved for them
then they seem to spring from every part of the country
one hears now of the chum the house had place very noted indeed the halted the lee park the stoke place the edinburgh the surbiton the trinity foot the wood dale missus jug ahs missus prices and missus turners
eyes brown dark hazel poor hazel not deep set nor bulgy and with a mild expression
ears long set on low finding texture and hanging in a graceful fold close to the cheek
neck moderately long slyly arched the throat showing some du lap
shoulders clean and slightly sloping
forelegs quite street full under the dog of good substance and round in the bone
feet round well knuckling up and strongly padded
coat smooth variety smooth very dense and not too fine or short
height not exceeding sixteen inches
all things which follow from the absolutely nature of any attribute of god must always exist and be infinite or in other words are each tarnal and infinite through the said attribute
proof conceive if it be possible supposing the proposition to be denied that something in some attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of these said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought
in its nature infinite
must necessarily exist
we have now granted therefore thought not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of god does not naturally follow from its nature in so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of god which is against our apotheosis
and beyond the limits of the duration of the idea of god supposing the latter at some time not to have existed for not to be going to exist thought would perforce have existed without the idea of god which is contrary to our hypothesis for we suppose that thought being given the idea of god necessarily flowed therefrom
bar in mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from god's absolute nature
corollary hence it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is inn's colic phraseology god is cause of the being of things as sandy rum
corollary individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of god or modes by which the attributes of god are expressed in a fixed and definite manner
such a call such a time you never did see
i was wishin somebody would give the conversation of start we indian made a break

never mind polly said jasper there's all next summer and after our winter and dressed in and all our hard work over music one of thee fine those at john round again and his eyes glistened
and you'll go on drawing and painting till you get to be a great artist ran on polly enthusiastically and then we'll see something you've done in the louve maybe the louve cried adela oh dear me polly pepper
tom selwyn had been very sober during all this merry chatter and now in his seat across the narrow aisle he drummed his heels impatiently on the floor
what's up little mother asked tom in surprise at her unusual manner it's this tom
when the news was circulated as it was pretty soon that the party was not to be broken into it all till paris was a completed story the jubilation was such as to satisfy even tom
oh isn't it oates peas beans and barley girl cried polly as they watched them intently
and his long arm went out and picked a jack and end of an urchin who incautiously regarding such quiet travellers is not worth minding had hovered too near while trying to tease the girls
and presently a woman came and took little blue pinafore off and then the rest of the girls unclasped their hands and the ring melted away and the game was over
i'm glad the girl's over here half fun said polly as grandpapa his party moved off isn't it nice to think they do
two or three days of rest at miny put everyone in good shape and gave them all a bit of time to pick up on many little things that work behindhand
that's my third letter polly announced jasper on the other side of the table now i'm going to begin on jolts
one two said poly counting why i thought i'd written three while this one is most finished jasper
dare said tom delighted to think that no terrible result had really ensued from his words that after they were out had scared him mightily
i'll post yours too polly give them here
then his face brightened and he said and she's right polly while polly fish took frank out of joe's little money bag that hung in her belts
do get the stamps pleased jasper and put them on and he took up her two letters and she gave the bag a little pat for joe's sake wishing it was his stubby black hair that her fingers could touch
i don't know where we are going to get nice wight paper far around robin said polly leaning her eblis on the table and her chin in her hands i know ejaculated tom whirling on his heel and dashing out
i want polly too said phronsie wriggling away from the pen that polly how out alluringly
phronsie who hadn't heard what polly said her small head being full of the responsibility of beginning the important letter and considering since it was to be done it was best to have it over with as soon as possible felt as scribbling a letters as fast as she could all them running downhill
it's all right grande ale like it he said
i tell you you don't know my grandaddy he's got lots fun in him he added
i won't cry any more declared phronsie wiping off the last tear trailing down the nose
then i shall be all as well as ever said polly kissing the wet little face
we must put them little pictures said polly tried to make herself cheery as the work went busily on
poy you always do think of the best things exclaimed jasper beaming at her which made her try harder than ever to smile
i wouldn't feel so badly polly he managed to a spur when phronsie was absorbed with her work tough i could probably just his father did the chine bread boy
he seems to accomplish something every time he goes observed jasper dryly hullo just look at him mow
oh dear me exclaimed adela as her scissors slipped now you've draggled the table again then she caught polly's eye
rather not much obliged tom bobbed his thanks
picture after picture cut from railroad guide books illustrated papers and it seemed to jasper gathered as if by magic with cunning little photographs broke up the letter and wound in and out with funny and charming detail of some of their journey
the rest of it is nice whispered jasper and i venture to say that he'll like that the best of all
mister king thought so too and he beamed at phronsie so you did he cried now that's fine i wish you'd write me a letter some time
but what can i do so small and stupid and shy as i am
i must find some way to give a little ones nice christmas
tom will like to have me goeth him and sing while he places harp in the streets
yes i will try and then if i do well but l a one shall have a merry christmas
but see then it is cold in the streets the wind bites and the snow freezes one singers
she thanked tommo and ran away to get ready for she felt sure her father would not release her anything
then she washed out little rance's frock and put it to dry because she would not be able to do it the next day
she longed to make the beds and dressed the children overnight she was in such a hurry to have all in order but as i could not be she sat down again and tried over all the songs she knew
when she had told her plan peter binary shook his head and thought it would never do motes begged so hard he consented at last that she should try it for one a week and sent her to bed the happiest little girl in new york
as soon as her father was gone tessa flew about and put everything in nice order telling the children she was going out for the day and they were to mind tom's mother who would see about the fire and the dinner for the good woman love tessa and entred into her little plans with all her heart
poor tess's heart beat fast as she trudged away with tabu who slung his harp over his shoulder and gave her his hand
it was rather a dirty hand but so kind that tessa clung to it and kept looking up at the friendly brown face for encouragement
say now have no fear give them bell monica that is marian will make the laugh whispered tom tuning his har
when fiddled french would nodded to her and it seemed to help her very much for she began to sing before she thought and that was the hardest part of it
but homo shook as curly hadad and answered superbly yes i took you there first for they love music and honour of our country but up among the great houses we shall not always do well
but she had made half a dollar for tumor divided and money fairly and she felt rich with her share
her hands were covered with chilblains where she had no mittens but she had put them under her shawl and shuffled merrily away in her big boots feeling so glad that the week was over and nearly three dollars slave in her pocket
how gave the streets were that day
how brast everyone was and how bright the faces looked as people tried about with big baskets holly wreaths and young evergreens going to blossom into splendid christmas trees
but i can't so i'll fill the socks all full and be happy said tessa as she looked wistfully into the gay stores and saw the heavy baskets go by
who knows what may happen if would you well return tommo nodding wisely for he had plan as well as tessa and kept chuckling over it as he charged through the might
well try one more street and then go home thou so tired little one
at the fourth some people let them sing all their songs and gave nothing
tessa felt so grateful that without waiting for tommo she sang her sweetest little song all alone
i'll ask mamma said rose and away she went into the dining room close by
as the door opened tess sal looked to her like a fairy feast all silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine and tall glass pictures and smoking dishes that smelt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfaction
ah yes i shall come with much gladness and play as never in my life before cried tommo with a flourish of the old cap that made the children laugh
give these to your brother said the fairy prince stuffing nuts and oranges and to tess his hands
all so tim so very kind i have no way to say thank you but runs shall be for you a heavenly angel and i will sing my heart out for your treat cried tessa folding the mittens as if she would say a prayer of thankfulness if she knew how
she got up early to see if the socks were all right and there she found the most astonishing sight
four socks instead of three and by the fourth pinned out quite elegantly was a little dress evidently meant for her o warm woollen dress all made and actually with bright buttons on it
tessa screamed and danced in her delight and up tumbled all the children to scream and dance with her making a regular carnival in small scale
in her long stocking she found all sorts of treasures for tum had stuffed it full of queer things in his mother had made tinder bed into every imaginable shape from fat pigs to full omnibuses
little lance was accepted with delight by the kind lady in her children and teller and the song quite easily
arose from the crowd of children gathered to the festival
before they went home the kind mamma told tessa he should be her friend and give her motherly kiss which warmed the child's heart and fin to set a pill upon that promise
the senator took his seat in the pulpit with the minister on one side of him and the superintendent of the sunday school on the other
so odd were they by the presence of a living united stat senator that during three minutes not a spit ball was thrown
after that they began to come to themselves by degrees and presently the spell was wholly gone and they were reciting verses and pully hair
the usual sunday school exercises were hurried through and then the minister got up and board the house with a speech built on the customary sunday school plan then the superintendent put in his oar and then the town dignitaries had there say
am i am some populous centre of my own country where the choicest children of the land have been selected and brought together as at a fair for a prize no
then where am i yes where am i
my soul is lost in wonder at the thought
earth has no higher no grander position for me
then what is it what did my consciousness reply
ah think of that now i could hardly keep the tears back i was so grateful
they could not give him a costly education but they were good and wise and they sent him to the sunday school he loved the sunday school
i hope you love your sunday school i see by your faces that you do that is right
always love your teachers my children for they love you more than you can know now
and by and by the people made him governor and he said it was all owing to the sunday school
why the people gave him a towering illustrious position a grand imposing position
it was senator of the united states
that poor little boy that loved his friend school became not man that man stands before you
above all things my children be honest
whence enter dilworthy departed from cattle ville he left three dozen boys behind him arranging a campaign of life whose objective point was the united stat senate
whelk is a delightful child
there was no their such child there never had been and there never would be
while ea's mother ser female alexandrovna was sure of that
bloch hiss eyes were dark and large her cheeks or rosy her lips were made for kisses and for laughter
but it was not these chimes and thella that gave her mother the keenest joy
she felt cold with her husband
he was always fresh and cool with a frigid smile and wherever he passed cold current sink move in the air
it even seemed at spa alexandrovna that she was in love with her future husband and this made her happy
the bag was also good looking she was a tall dark eyed dark haired girl somewhat to made but very tactful
he had connections and his wife came a good influential people
this might at the proper opportunity prove useful
after their marriage there was nothing in the manner of sonya movin to suggest anything wrong to his wife
later however when his wife was about to have a child sar gain mono hitch established connections elsewhere of a light and temporary nature
spa alexandrovna found the sou and to her own astonishment was not particularly hert she awaited her infant with a restless anticipation that swallowed every other feeling
ser puma alexandrovna drifted farther and farther away from him
u luka then ran away standing with her plump little legs over the carpets and hid herself behind the curtains near her bed
where is my baby girl the mother asked as she looked for l luka may believe that she did not see her
then she came out a little farther and her mother as though she had only just caught sight of her seized her by her little shoulders and exclaimed joyously here she is my la lita
her mother's eyes glowed with passionate emotion
her mother went to hide
welt ga turned away as though not to see but watch match ga stealthily all the time
where is mor luka asked la lack
a smile of absolute bliss played on her red lips
roule goes getting nearer her mother's corner
her mother was growing more absorbed every moment by her interest in the game her heart beat with short quick strokes and she pressed even closer to the wall dis arranging her hair still more the
reelect ga suddenly glanced toward her mother's corner and screamed with joy
through the half close doors he heard the laughter the joyous outcries the sound of romping
even fedosya felt abashed now for her mistress now for herself
he liked coming here where everything was beautifully arranged this was done by seraph ma alexandrovna who wished to surround her little girl from her very infancy only with the loveliest things
sarah ma alexandrina dressed herself tastefully this too she did for l lug with the same end in view
one thing sergey moskva had not become reconciled to and this was his wife's almost continuous presence in the nursery
it's just as i thought i knew that i'd find you here he said with a deserving condescending smile
merely you see that the child should feel its own individuality he explained in answer to seraph ina out senna toss puzzled plants
she still so little said seraph paa alexandrovna
i don't insist it's your kingdom here
i'll think it over his wife answered smiling as he did coldly but genially
then they began to talk of something else
that mistress does it while that's one thing but that the young lady does it that's bad
why asked fides curiosity
this expression of curiosity gave her face the look of a wooden roughly painted doll
yes that's bad repeated agatho a conviction terribly bad well
it's the truth i'm saying remember my words a gacha went on at the same assurance and secrecy
it's the crest sign
the old woman had invented this sign quite suddenly herself and she was evidently very proud of it
madame madam she said quietly in a trembling voice
seraph ma alexandrovna gave a start
edy's face made her anxious
what is it fidel asia she asked with break concern as there anything wrong with l lack
no madam said fiducia she gesticulated with her hands to reassure her mistress and to make her sit down
much cause a sleep may god be with her
only i'd like to say something you see we much gives always hiding herself that is not good
i can't tell you how bad it is said fidel asia and her face expressed the most decided confidence
i understand nothing of what you are saying
you see madam mit a kind of omen explains f lusia abruptly and the shamefaced way
nonsense said seraph ma alex and job
who told you all this asked sar heh ma alexandrovna in a steer low voice
nos exclaimed seraph ma alexandrovna irritation as though she wished to protect herself somehow from this sudden anxiety
what nonsense as though the lunch good could die
she saw clearly that there could be no possible connection between a child's quite ordinary diversion and the continuation of the child's life
she made a special effort that evening to occupy her mind with other matters but her thoughts turned involuntarily to the fact that will latch go love to hide herself
when the lunch was still quite small and had learned to distinguished between her mother and her nurse she sometimes sitting in her nurse's arms made a sudden rugg ish grimace and hid her laughing face and the nurse's shoulder
then she would look out with a sly glance
though she reproached herself at once for this unfounded superstitious dread nevertheless she could not end her wholeheartedly into the spirit will luka a's favorite game and she tried to divert relics attention to something else
she eagerly complied with their mother's new wishes
seraph ma alexandrovna tried desperately to amuse gluck
perhaps that seraph ma alexandrovna she is not as strongly drawn to the world as other children who attracted by many things
if this is so is it not a sign of organic meekness
spy mouth senna herself began the game once or twice though she played it with a heavy heart
she suffered as though committing an evil deed with full consciousness
it was a sad day for seraph ma alexandrovna
her mother covered her with a blue blanket
l much carew her sweet little hands from under the blanket and stretched them m to embrace her mother her mother bent down
she seemed so small and so frail under the blanket that covered her
spa alexandrovna remained standing over lyle pa's bed a long while and she kept looking at the lug with tenderness and fear
i'm a mother is it possible that i shouldn't be able to protect her she thought as she imagined the various ills that might be follow lack
she prayed long that night but the prayer did not relieve her sadness
several days passed will latch v cock cold
the fever came upon her at night
when seraphim ma alexandrovna awakened by fedosya came to l lunch gun saw her looking so hot so restless and so tormented she instantly recalled the evil omen and a hopeless dispirited possession of her from the first moments
our doctor was called and everything was done that as usual on such occasions but the inevitable happened
and the lunch grew feeler from hour to hour
nothing made her so unhappy as the reiteration of fedosya uttered between sobs she hid herself and hid herself arletta
fever was consuming relet ga and there were times when she lost consciousness and spoke in delia
three days passed torturing like a nightmare
serf ma alexandrovna hid her face behind the curtains near lych gould's bed how tragic
i'll wait m march go whispered l logger
much goa white face became blurred and everything grew dark before lola
she met her husband
setina alexandrovna was standing by the coffin and looking dully at her dead child
se ma my dear don't agitate yourself said sergeant lets hitch in a whisper
you must resign yourself to your fate
she'll be up in a minute persisted sur female alexandrovna her eyes fixed on the dead little girl
sergey ludovic looked round him cautiously he was afraid of the unseemly and of the ridiculous
see i don't agitate yourself he repeated
he was confused and annoyed
her face seemed tranquil and her eyes were dry
she went into the nursery began to walk brown the room looking into those places where lych ga used to hide herself
she walked all about the room and bent now and ben look under the table or under the bed and captain repeating cheerfully where's my little one where is my loch ga
after she had walked round the room once she began to make her question me
fiducia motionless with dejected face sat in a corner and looked frightened at her mistress then she suddenly burst out sobbing and she wailed loudly
she hid herself and hid herself are the latch guy at angelic little soul
when she entered the parlour there was several people between her and la luka
there was an oppressive feeling of heaviness and seraphim alexandrovna's had as she approached loch ga
will latch go lay there still and pale and smiled pathetically
the little one did not reply
seraphim alexandrovna stood up erect side in a lost way smiled and called loudly bleat ga
we much goes being carried out
captain bull the commander of a small garrison at seabrook permitted him to land but when the governor began to read his commission full ordered him to be silent
what has happened mister prince wass worths asked for he could see that the man was greatly excited governor andrews has come again guessed mister prince why should that alarm us the fellow they' get into boasting is not dangerous or liable to put his threats into execution but he was grown dangerous declared mister prince the liberties of the coloni are involved
captain wadsworth became a little uneasy though he was still inclined to treat the matter lightly
we have surely refused to yield our charge involuntarily for it is the guardian of our political rights
that is true cap and wadsworth continued mister prince and to subdue our stubbornness this vor has come to hartford with sixty armed men to demand the surrender of the charter in person
captain walworth founded to his feet in a rage and placing his hand on the hilt of his sword declared he shall not have it
the day was well nice spent when he arrives and the members were engaged in a heated debate on a subject of the utmost importance
he consented however to await the discussion but as soon as it was ended he declared that he would have the charter
after that captain had taken two or three turns across the room he paused and asked
what is the assembly doing engaged in debate
and will he wait until it ended he has promised to do so
mister prince fix's amazed eyes on the captain's face and read their desperate determination captain he again
mister prince bowed and hastily returned to the house toward the assembly was in session
as soon as he was gone charleses feed and said
yes charles who will answer what do you mean uncle
never did debaters take greet or interest in a minor subject
what do you intend doing uncle will you fight them
remember the work must be done right at the time not too soon nor to wait
the sun was setting and the captain said
come charles let us hasten to the assembly
by no means but i want you to be fully in crested with a seriousness of your mission
take your pleace charles and be prepared to do your part whispered captain watchword
charles god is close to the long capable use by the secretaries is possible without attracting special attention
the discussion went on darkness came and four lighted candles were placed on the table in two set on a shelf on the wall
those two candles on the wall were agreed anoints to charles until he saw a man station near them
though the lights were extinguished through the window the faints starlight dimly illuminated the scene
he followed him as rapidly as he could
these was cloth behind him and when they were outsides used his arm
oh i had a care how you approached me
the soldiers began the crowd about the house when at a signal from tacking wadsworth the train fans came on the scene and prepared to grapple with the soldiers
where is the charter
you have your soldiers at the door and we have the trainbands of connecticut ready to defend us against violence
who of you has the charter
it was the boy crazing range governor
every member of the assembly shook their heads
we do not know him he does not let in communicate where does he live
little did the captain or his youthful assistant dream that their simple act would make the old tree historic
the tree in which the doc nut was hitting was ever afterwards known as charter oak
it remained v grace bearing fruit every year and tittle a little after midnight august eighteen fifty sixth when it was prostrated by a heavy storm of wind
when the order from the seizure of the charters was first made known the assembly roy island sent a most loyal ages to the king sang
he formerly resolved the assembly broke the seal of the colony which bore the figure of an anchor and the word hope and mitted five in the inhabitants into his legislative council and assumed the function of governor but he did not take away the parchment on which the charter was written
from that time until before union of the colonies from mutual defence at the bursting out of the friends in indian war the inhabitants of rod island or their share in the defensive efforts especially when the hostile savages hung along their fren new york like an ill omened cloud
the history is that commonwealth is identified with that of all new england from the beginning of king william's war soon after the expulsion of ands
colbert who had heard his uncle getting ready to run down to the water's edge
it's a schooner said mister bingham to mister mint and she h a very heavy cargo
to this chord was fastened a heavy rope or table
what's that board for asper as he saw board following the table
that's the directions said how
they are printed in a number of languages and they tell the crew to carry the end of the cable high up to the mast and fasten it strongly there
oh i see said berg the lang will stretch then and the breeches booley will go out on a pully
it was clear day nail and much of the wicked storm that passed
with the daylight king girls of women to the beach
missus bobbsey missus minting marly and her mother besides dorothy at ma'am were all there flossy and freddy being obliged to stay home with dinah and susan
of course the girls asked all sorts of questions and burton how tried to answer them as best they could
it seemed the long time before any movement of the cable showed that the bully was returning
nearer and negro i came until now a man's head could be seen
the girls and women were too frightened to talk and nellie clung close to her mother
a big roller dashing and and finished the work for the lice birds and a man in the corse felt banded upon shore
everybody gathered around and nelly with a strange face and a stranger hope broke through the crowd to see the rescued man
oh it is my father she screamed falling right into the ears of the drenched man
but the half dreamed man rubbed his eyes as if he should not believe them then the next minute he pressed his little daughter to his heart unable to speak a word
and as george bringing out there anxiously asked the brother
safe and well can the welcome answer
i guess our prayers were hard at last night
shere come another man exclaimed the people as this time a big man dashed on sands
while i declare we did land on a friendly shore
just as mister bingham said though lie saving work turned out to be a social affair for there was a great time greeting nell's father and how's uncle
and how on his father too put in man
what a morning that was it sunset beach
i'm so glad we prayed said little flossy freddy when she heard the good names
a beautiful day had grown out of the dreadful storm
and everybody was so happy
the neptune the vessel that had struck on the sand fi was now safely anchored near shore and the sailors came in and out in rowboats back and forth to land just as they wished
then we had to go back to work at the logs went on the captain and then one of our crew took a fever
that was what galena so
finally we had every wall blowed on the schooner and we started off
we canted on getting home less weak when this last storm struck us and droll us out of our course
about the value asked mister bobbsey who was down from the city
the value repeated the captain aside so that the strangers might not hear
while i'm a rich man now and so is my mate mc g roclin for that wood was contracted for by the largest and richest piano firm in this country and now it is all but delivered to them and the money in our hands
yes indeed it would have taken us a lifetime to a king way with much money as we have earned in the cheer
maybe aunt emily will take ye down to the city on her shopping tour suggested nan
he made the clerks to move all the trucks from the isles and i guess everybody was glad the army fell down
the wonderful fresh air that these men lived in night and day had brightened their eyes too so that even the plainest faced and the most awkward man among them was as nimble as an athlete from his perfect exercise
i don't know how to say good bye you ney told dorothy and m next morning
oh that will be splendid declared man
youre quite rich now aren't you remarked dorothy
and dorothy went up and down the room like the pictures of cinderella's proud sisters
we will be on hand thank you replied the joking dorothy
come nelly called missus m gluck lan i'm ready where's your hat
we might be able to manage that too nelly told him
my uncle is a fireman and he can take us through his engine house
most of them i guests answered berg
well we have had a good vacation and i'm willing to go to work again
so am i declared nan vacation was just long enough i think
mister bobbsey was down from the city of course to take the family home and now all hands even freddy and flossy were busy tracking up
there were the shells to be looked after the fish nets besides downy the duck and snooks the cat
and so our little friends had spent all their vacation
his characters get john cog mad with jealousy or fallen epileptic fits all rave hysterically
if dor sher ski had had less vision he would have been stringer
like them he is a novelist of torture
certainly the last of cruelty the lusted destruction for destruction's sake is the most conspicuous of the deadly sins in justa skies men and women
he may not be a cruel author
but they are ever in balance they are always in demoniacal conflict
even the last is never hardly ever the lust of a more or less sane man
dust ski could not have described a sin of nekhludoff in resurrection
this is a madhouse cries someone indies
one resulted this is a multiplicity of action
even the talk is all actions more than o ideas
he saw his violent deeds not with the hand but with the suck
but one had noticed during this last two days that the other was wearing a silver watch on a yellow bead chain which he seems not to have seen on him before
he took a knife and when his friend had turned away he approached him cautiously from behind took aim turned his eyes heavenwards crossed himself and praying fervently god forgive me for crow's sake
he never paints every man he always projects dostoevsky or a nightmare dostoevsky
that is why clime and punishment belongs to a lower range of fiction than any corner or fathers and sons
we sympathize indeed with the fears the bravado the despair that succeed the crime
he is a grotesque made alive by sheer imaginative intensity in passion
one does not grudge an artist and abnormal character or two
he invent vicious greatest as dickens events comic greatest
was very fond of hanging cuts and burying them with great ceremony
as for the cram of themselves he betrays the old father and the oldest of his sons hating each other in fighting like brutal maniacs
serve him right shouted dmitri breathlessly
if i haven't killed him i'll come again and kill him
it is easy to see why dost ski has become a popular author
no melodramatic ever poured out incident upon the stage from such a haunt of plenty
desks always ready to show them all in at once
on two opposite pages of the idiot one finds the following character brought in by name general puncheon prince s adelaida ivanovna elizabetta procopius now yevgeny pavlovitch redon ski princess pekin ski a glare prince miskin coil volga ippolit valio ferdy shank nastasya philipovna nina alexandrovna guna twistin and general e bogan
but the secret of dost skins appeal is something more than the multitude in thrill of his incidents and characters
mister murry bor did faces of difficulty and attempts to definition
to him the ski work is the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life it is more than a record of a struggle it is for struggle itself
and those voices take shape in certain unforgettable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly mean tavern certain surrounding darkness
ultimately they are the creations not of a man who desired to be but of a spirit which sought to know
because they have possessed they are no longer men and women
this is all in i masion true
to say this is not to deny the spirit of content of dust desk is work the anguish of the imprisoned souls at battles with doubt and denial and despair
there is in dostoevsky a suggestion of caliban trying to discover some better god than sir tables
the ultimate attitude of dust ski is as christian as the apostle peters lord i believe help d m unbelief
and beyond the dark night of suffering and dissipating the night gusts is still seized a light of christian compassion
or even by the compassion of others like prince miskin in the idiot
his work like his face bears the mark of this terrible conflict
the novels of the perfect image of the man
as to the man himself the vicomte dev gay described him as he saw him in the last years of his life
when he became excited on a certain points one could have sworn that one had seen him before seated i mention a police court awaiting trial or among vagabonds who passed their time begging before the prison doors
at all other times he carried that look of sad and gentle meekness seen on the images of old savant saints
that the portrait of the men one sees behind oust sky's novels the portrait one might almost have inferred from the novels
it is a figure that it once fascinates and repels
he is not by temperament to singer
his music is a still small voic unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and storm
truth to tell mister hardy is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet
he does not express life easily in beautiful words or an images
thus he writes in i found her out there of one who
there could not be an ugly and more prose saturation there contained in the
and prose in juries in the trace of words as well as in images
take for example the use of the word domiciled in the passage in the same palm about
when we strangers sought their catering care veiled smiles bespoke their thought of what we were
catering care is an appalling phrase
is a line of good poetry
you did not come and marching time drew on and warm me numb yet lost for loss of your dear presence there than that i thus fan lacking in your make that higher compassion which can overbear reluctance for pure loving kindness sake grieved when is the ho bower stroked it some you did not come
there are hints of the grand style of lyric poetry in these lines but fraser's lurk in your make and as the hope hour stroked it some a discords the bread tumbling to the levels of victorian commonplace
he has a temperament sensitive beyond that of all but a few recent writers to the pain and passion of human beings
one can remember palm after poem of his with a theme that might easily have served for mister hardy too late christina the lost mistress the last ride together the statue and the bust to name a few
but what a sense of child there is in browning's tragedy
his world is a place of opulence not a poverty
to have loved him for an hour is with browning to live forever after in the inheritance of a mighty achievement
to have loved for an hour is in mister hardy's imagination to have deepened to sadness even more than the beauty of one's memories
for then i u distressed by hearts growing cold for me could lonely wait my endless rest with equanimity
but time to make me grieve part steals lets part abide and shakes this fragile frame and eaves with throbbings of me tide
and despair is by no means triumphant in what is perhaps the most attractive of all mister harder poems the oxen
we pictured the meek mild creatures where they dwelt in this jury pen nor did it occur to one of us there to doubt over kneeling then
the murder faith however or rather of delight in the memory of fief is not mister hyde iss prevailing mood
he can enter upon a wall without ironic good darts as we see in the song men who march away
how long he cries in a poem written some years ago
when shall the sane of softer policies whereof the dream have sway in each proud land and patriotism grown god luck scorn to stand bon slave to realms but circle earth and seeds
but perhaps his characteristic attitude to wars to be found not in lines like these but in that melancholy poem the souls of the slain in which the souls of the dead soldiers return to their country in question a senior soul flame was to how their friends and realities have kept their doughty deeds in remembrance
and general hell hold out her sweethearts sworn royal as doves
some fickle and fleet hearts have found in new loves
and our wives quoth another resignedly d they on our deeds
mister hardy has true bitter a sense reality to believe much in the glory of war
the ver weeld to mister hardy is the world of ancient human things in which war has come to be a hideous irrelevance
it may be thought on the other hand that mister hardy's poems about war are no more expressive of tragic futility than his poems about love
futility and frustration are ever re caring seems in both
his lovers love his soldiers wrought in the grey defeated of their glory
lovers are always savored both in life and in death
in beyond the last lamp we have the same mournful cry over severance
no shade of pinny cool or tree or tower while earth injures will fallen my mound and within the hour still unto yours one wen never haunt are too green coverts
they bring his face to face with an experienced intenser that o own
nothing of tiniest worth have i wrought pondered planned no one thing asking blame or praise since the pale corpse like birth of this diurnal unit bearing blanks in all its rays dullest of dull hued days

so par lope went to blind's party and her dress was the admiration of every girl there
when ill bethought her altogether charming
she looks us if she had just stepped out of the frame of some lovely old picture she said to herself

soon after these our mother died and our house called was broken up
my dear i am a very lonely old woman with nobody belonging to me
now she patted missus fire wethers soft all hand affectionately
doris and penelope found their leaves and plans changed in the twin cling of an eye
where missus farewell had gone dor isn't penelope looked at each other

see they side and went dst there for the baby
all her days were alike as far as hard work and dullness went but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly
but she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter
the room was more and their box about the kitchen which siding they shrew small cousins

everything i told you about it and my life was just imagination
then why did you write them he asked blandly
why did you deceive me
oh i didn't mean to disease you i never thought of such a thing
i just couldn't write you about my life here not because it was hard but it was so ugly and empty

this wit seems routh are better than that we took him me other faces but warning only out again and must be looking out for more

the piece of cambria was called the ladies piece in honor the two princesses who had goot it though morally different and a very unequal worth they both had minds of a rare order and trained to recognize political necessities and not to attempt any but possible successes

in fifteen sixty two at the battle of drew he was aged and so ill that none expected to see him on horseback

at last he decided upon retreating
it was gars also de la bega the prince of spanish poesy the spanish petrarch according to his fellow countrymen
morns signed a similar one for piedmont
they all repaired together to the house prepared for their reception and after dinner the emperors being tired lay down to rest on a couch queen eleanor before long went and tapped at his door and sent word to the king that the emperor was awake
francis with the cardinal de loraine and the constable the memory soon arrived
on entering the chamber he found the emperor still lying down and chatting with his sister queen who was seated beside him on a chair
yes said charles i had made such cheer that i was obliged to sleep it off
frantz did the converse with his own collar
only seven of the attendants remained in the emperor's chamber and there the two sovereigns conversed for an hour after which they moved to the hall where a splendid supper awaited them
the gaines pleaded their privilege of not being liable to be taxed without their own consent
orders had been sent everywhere to receive him as kings of france are received on their joyous accession
this sis there existed for us no responsibility we each reported dutifully at the role call of habit and drop back into our blankets with a grateful sigh
i remember the moon sailing a good gate among apparently stationary clouds i recall a deep black shadow lined before distant silvery mountains i glanced over the starved motionless canvases each of which concealed a man the air trembled with the bellman of cattle and the corrals
singly but a moment later the cooks how brought me to consciousness again
three were to care for the ramada five were to move the straight herd from the corrals to good fee three brand crews are told to brand the calves we had collected in the cut of the afternoon before that took up about half the men
the wist were to make a shore drive in the salt grass
we were the only ones who did go afoot however although the crows were not more than two hundred yards as distance
between the upright bars of grease wood we could see the cattle and near the opposite side the men building a fire next defence
we pushed open the wide gate and entered
one stood waiting for them to finish the sheaf of long j stamen irons in his hand
all the wrists squatted on their hills along the pince smoked cigarettes and chatting together
the first rays of the sun sighted across in one great sweep from the remote mountains
homer wooden the o count forty john rooting among the cattle
as a loop settled he jerked sharply upward exactly as one would strike to hook a big fish
homo rapped the rope twice were thrice about the horn and set over in on stripped avoid the tiding line and to preserve the balance
nobody paid any attention to the calf
behind him followed his anxious mother her head swing in from side aside near the fire the horse stopped
the two bull dogs immediately pounce upon the victim
it was promptly warped over on its right side
thus the calf was unable to struggle
when once you have had the wind knocked out of you or a river too broken you cease to thinks unnecessarily rough
hot iron yelled one of the bull dogs
marker yelled the other
the brand oppressed the iron smoothly against the flank
perhaps the cat bladed a little lest the heat scorched
the brand show cherry which is the proper color to indicate due plan and a successful mark
then he knit out a swallow tail in the other
it seems me the great deal of unnecessary twaddle was abroad as to the extreme cruelty of brandon
undoubtedly it is to some extent painful it could some other method of ready identification be devised it might be as well to adopted in preference
inextinguishable laughter fall the sprit of this doctor through arizona
imagine a puncher descended to examine politely the ear tags of wild cattle on the open range were in around up
a cat usually bellows when the iron bites but as soon as released he almost invariably ghost of feedin or to lookin idly about

one of the little animals was but a few months old so the rider did not bother with its hind legs but tosses loop over it's neck
mister frost bull calf alone and pictorial history shows the attitudes
and then of course there was the gorgeous contrast between all this frantic and uncomprehended excitement and the absolute matter of fact and perpetua ability of horse and writer
as he knew his business and as the calf was a small one the little beast went over promptly bit the ground with the whack and was pounced upon and held
he would catch himself on one foot scrambled vigorously an e by struggling back to the upright
he could imagine what happy next
this is productive of some fun of it fails
but now the brandon wasn't full swing
when the nooses fell they turn and walked toward the fire as a matter of course rarely did the cast fail
men ran to and fro busy an intent
sometimes through four cabs were on the grounded once
thus aided dissipated
no more nick calves they announced
then he would spit on his hands and go out it alone
of luck attended his first effort his sorrowed chasm was profound there's your little calf said he
would you like to have me tooted to you ord you reckon you could toddle this far with your little old iron
toward non the work select
finally whom rode over to the cattleman and reported the brandon finished
the latter counted the marks in his tally book
one hundred seventy six he announced
the markers squatted on their heels told over the bits ears they had saved
but total amounted to but an hundred seventy five

it fair made my hair rise to hear him with a big still solemn dab outside and the quiet moonlight in the shadows and him setting up straight and gaunt his eyes blazing each side his big eagle nose and his snaky hair hanging over the raw cut across his head
however i made out to get him bandage up and in shape and pretty soon he sorted once to sleep
then agin sing d barbary saw me till go look at the old collar rota flowing b jist to be sure id n't dyin gone below or elsie jest talk
he began when he was a kid and he gave his sight of conversations pulsing for replies
i used to listen by the hour but i never made out anything really important as to who the man was but where he'd come from or what he done
i didn't pay any attention tone for he is quiet
usually i didn't bother with his talk for it didn't mean anything a something in his voice mad me turn
he was lion on aside those black eyes of his blazon me but now both of them saw the same distance

one little squeeze talk about your deadly weapons

now look here said i you can't get up today you ain't fit
i know he pleaded but let me see them
just as satisfying i passed over his old birds
i've been robbed he cried
where's my coat he asked
you had no coat when i'll pitch you up i replied
he looked at mean mighty suspicious but didn't say anything more he wouldn't even answer when i spoke to him
after he did' a fair male he fell asleep
when it came back that even in the bunk was empty and he was gone
i didn't seem again for two days
then i caught sat him quite aways all
guess he's suspicious i stole that cotta his thinks i and afterwards i found that my surmise had been correct
however he didn't stay long in that friend mind

on the middle of his back name one armed friend
anyway i thrust the muzzle of mar colts into the sailors face what's this i asked

the gleam died from his eye the snarl lift his lips
in any casey flew pop proto leaving me and my friend together
during the next two months he was a good deal about town moser doing odd jobs i saw him off and on
however i didn't pay much attention to that being at the time i mighty busy holding down m card games

it's money i got to have and his money haven't got an can't git an less a let somebody and his partner
wai asked why not he retorted
we taught the matter over at length
i stood after a larger party
he strongly opposed this as depreciating the shares but i had no intention of going alone into what was then considered a wild and dangerous country finally re compromised
a third of the treasure was to go to him a third to me and the rest was to be divided among the man whom i should select his scheme did not appeal to him
junior avonlea found it hard to settle down to humdrum existence again
perhaps after a while i'll get used to it but i'm afraid concert spoil people for everyday life

the winter weeks slip by
on anne's breath day they were tripping lightly down it keeping eyes and ears alert amid all the chatham for miss stacy had told them that they must soon writ a composition on a winters walk in the woods and it behooved them to be observant
i can scarcely realize them in my teens
it's a great comfort to think but i'll be able to use big words then without being laughed at
ruby gillis thinks of nothing but bows said anne disdainfully
shes actually delighted when anyone writes her name of th it take notice for all she pretends to be so mad
i'm trying to be as much like missus allan as i possibly can for i think she's perfect
if i had alice bell's crooked nose said anne decidedly i wouldn't but there
i'm afraid i think too much about my nose ever since i heard that compliment about it long ago
oh diana look there's a rabbit
though so white and still as if they were asleep and dreaming pretty dreams
i rote at last monday evening
its call it the jealous rival or in death not divided
i read it to marilla and she said it was stuff in nonsense
it's a sad sweet story
cordelia was a regal brunette with a cornet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes
you know so much more than you did when you were only twelve
they grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen
i asked ruby gillis if she knew anything about how men propose because i thought shed likely be an authority of the subject having so many sisters married
but she pretended to be giants friend the same as ever
let's you and me have a story club all her own and write stories for practice
you ought to cultivate your imagination you know miss stacy says so
only you must take the right way
this was how the story club came into existence
near boys were allowed in it although rum iulus a pine that their admission would make it more exciting and each member had to produce one story a week
each girl has to read her story out loud and then we talk it over
mine rosamond mont morcerf all the girls you pretty bow
i'm sure that must have a wholesome effect
the more was the great thing mister ellen says so
i read one of my stories to him and missus allen and they both agree that the moral was excellent
jane and ruby almost always cry when i come to the pathetic parts
miss josephine berry wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life
i'm sure missus allan was never such a silly forgetful little girl as you are
i felt so encourage when i heard that
missus lynde's has she always filled shocked when two years of anyone ever having been naughty no matter how small they were
now i wouldn't have felt that way
vanity and vexation of spirit
the spring was abroad in the land and marilla's sober middle aged step was slighter and swifter because of its deep primal gladness
i must say with all her thoughts i never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and i'm real sorry to find her so now
perhaps you're judging her too hastily marilla
of course i knew you'd take her part matthew but i'm bring youre up not you
depended marilla anxiously going over to the bed
anne cowered deeper into her pillows as if desires of hiding herself over from mortal eyes no
get right up this minute in tommy
this minute i say banner what is it
and had slid to the floor in despairing obedience
yes it's dream moaned
i've thought nothing could be as bad as red hair
he haven't gotten into any scrape for ever two months and i was sure another one would stay
now then what does you do to your hair
anne shirley didn't you know it was wicked thing to do
yes i knew it was a little wicked admitted anne
i know what it feels like to have your word doubted
and missus allan says we should never suspect anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they' not
but i haven't been and i believed every word he said implicitly
who said are you tiding about
oh i didn't let him in the house
in a trice i saw myself with beautiful rave and black hair and the temptation was irresistible
oh marilla but a tangled web we weave when first we practise two to see
you heard must be cut off there is no other way you can't go out with it looking like that
with a dismal sigh she went for the scissors
but there was nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you've died it at dreadful color is there
i'm going to weep all the time' cutting it off if it wanted a fear
it seemed such a tragically
anne wept then but laid her arm when she went upstairs and looked in the glass she was calm with despair
yes i will to the
i never thought i was vain about my hair of all things but now i know i was in spite of its being red because it was so long and thick and curly
i expect something how will happen to my nose next
anne's clipped made a sensation in school in the following monday but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for not even josie pye who however did not fail to inform anne that she looked like a perfect scarecrow
it's hard to be told you look like a scarf kick scarecrow and i wanted to says them thing back but i did it
and makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people doesn't it
i mean to devote all my energies to be good after this and i shall never try to be beautiful again

dinah says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head to the bow at one side
i will call it a snout that sounds so romantic
my head is better now

of course you must be lane anne said diana
of course it would be romantic conceded jane andrews but i know that i couldn't keep still

an e lane was a lily mid
your complexion is just as fair as rubies said diana earnestly and your hair is ever so much jocker than it used to be before you cut it
it was splendid to fish for trot over the bridge and the two girls lured to row themselves about in the little flat bottom dory mister barye product shooting
it was an ida that the dramatize lane
those day she said were so much more romantic than the present
they had often gone down like this and the thing could be more convenient for playing away
the black shell having been procured anne spaded over the flat and then lay down on the bottom with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast
it spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before missus lande was born
tan year ranches
it's silly furl to be talking when she's dead
jane rested the occasion
thus behind the landing
anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard she was white to the lips but she did not lose her self possession
there is one chine just one

for whether in that state men would have been master of roman
therefore in the state of innocence man had no mastership of the animals
therefore in the state of innocence before men had its spade nothing dispatching him
secondly disapproved by the other of divine providence which has governs in beery things by the superior
certainly this is proved from a property men and bother animals
now whatever part is pated is subjected what is essential and universe
therefore a subjection of other animals to man as prop to be natural
they would now hither on this kind have been accepted from the mastership of men as neither oppressing nor day for their reason accepted from the mastership of god whose providence has ordained others
this is signified by the fact that god let the animals to men that he might give the names expressive their respected natures
so all animals would have a bit men of their own court as in the presence day some domestic animals obey him
objection one it was seen that in sailer sense men would not have had mastership over all other creatures
much last therefore would have a bed man in the state of the misters
therefore since it is by this reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems fitting the stately since man had have been in over plans
now in then reason has the position the master and not of a subject
i answer that we must need admit that in a primitive state they would have been some any quality at least as regards sex because generation depends upon diversity sex and likewise as regards age for some would have been borne of others nor would sear union have been sterile
there might also have been bodily disparity
the quality miles a rise on the parts of nature as bove described without any defective nature
objection one he will sin that in the sty since man would not hay mess over men
therefore in the state of innocence mow not have been subjected man
in other sense mastership is referred in a general sends to ann kon of subject and in this sense even pay has the office of governing and directing free men can be call master
such a kind of mastership would have existed in the styes between man and men for two reasons
but in the state of innocence they would have been lowliness age
on the contrary everything generated is cursing perfect but in the sate innocence children have be begot by generation
therefore from the first they would happen in perfect in boding size and power
therefore in the state of innocence there was no need for women to be borne on the contrary nature's possess in generation that happy in common with never in which it was established by god
i have been told that mister van brandt is imprison for debt i said
and i saw for myself last night that he had left you hopeless

it would be better and happier for us both if you had as little pride as a child pride she repeated
in such a position as mine

am i to marry you for my food and shelter

though wretchedest creature about walks the streets which shrink from treating you in that way

i yielded and spoke of it no more
every words she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom i had loved and lost
bitterly as i hated the man who had parted us i loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake hopeless infatuation
i don't deny it i don't excuse it hopeless infatuation you have forgiven me i said
let me deserve to be forgiven
it is something to be your only friend

are you aware as the delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to borrow money in ar policy of insurance
i know nothing about it she said sadly
will you let me ask advice at my lawyers
they are trustworthy unexperienced men and i am sure they can be abused to you
cautiously as i had expressed myself her delicacy took the alarm
promise that you won't ask me to borrow money of you for mister van branch she rejoined and i will accept to help gratefully
i could honestly promise that
my one chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge to course that i had now determined to pursue
i rose to go while my resolutions still sustained me
kiss me she whispered before you go
it is only your goodness that overpowers me

the days glided by with the stiffness and crisp limps growing thus painful and the pony recovering fast for the clear mountaineer seemed to act like a cure for wounds
every day that came showed the injured animal and better condition
as efforts to move longer made christ winds and forget his own pains in those he fell at seeing the must suffer
everyone was busy for the keeping watch regularly took up a good deal of time
it's our nonsense ned cried kiss for them to think that they're stinging on account of us hullo griggs were you listening

just hearted a little on the bad leg but is better than always yesterday

he says we're d stir to morrow at daybreak
hurrah cried kiss
but we shan't my lad why not
pas seene indians again
oh you're always seen indians again
while they show themselves to me i didn't want them said grigg dryly

and he turned the doctor likes
being shot at thy fellows with bows and arrow sounds bad enough but there's not much risk here
i don't know about that said chris anxiously
don't you well i do
i should be any fast and dodging in and out among the rocks and cheese
but enemy won't be staying thilk continued griggs
don't believe there's a bitter risk for me i shall be all right
but animals will be well back in that hall said chris
yes my lad i'll want them to be planted forgo backs fill
i'm afraid father will say that the ponies ought to be close at hand
yes that's sight as it can be done but it'll go hard with us all as the indians gave up the bay of the trap and turn upon those who said it
well you must talk it a ru with father said chris
too many redskins about as i told you
theyre always too many red skins about cried christ impatiently
i wish you could charge them boldly i send them flying over the plains
never to come back again said ned sharply
not quite my lads don't you see that were playing a very ticklish game
just then the doctor came into the shelter with a boys having talking bringing with them walton lovely shooting or rather trying to shoot for he had had no success and they two were talking earnestly about ways ands
i'll hear yard brigs c the doctor
had a good turnus scouting yes sir
the indians have shifted the quarters and there ina b us elk a position as we could contrive our purpose
we must get aways on him to some good hunting ground
to the indians seem to be camping for only on the moves
this seemed to me to be hatching up some dodger another replied brooks
then he began to walk up and down slowly evidently deep in thought
there he said as made of th mind
it is very evident that we may wait he return stores iced and be as far off the opportunity we seek as eard
the indians can wait we cannot and they seems know it
going to give up young chris's plan said grig bo
no i'm going to put it in force out once we start tonight
but all the same we can be making our preparations
the barrels can be flood with water and everyone's bot of
provisions can be paps in now walls in fact everything how ready for a start
finally just at dusk the atoms cob trans for flute and water and
exactly replied the doctor
but before any more sent griggs i want to offer you to opportunity to drop back
well for said group sharply

we mean the shutting up the enemy here to stars
the jacketed griggs so shrub that the boys started som right if they did sir
what business have they to want our sculp but we should have shed them up to five
they'd have weeks of work before they could get their horses out but without horses they'd be out in awake
star nonsense
but there i don't want to make speeches it's our settle gentleman
well you've got to tell the lookout with coming off
now everyone understand that he is to be ready without showing any watch foot in din scout that there is something on the way
and again when the artist's following mal corn's advice a little late in arriving and when saint agnan had been obliged to be absent for some time it was interesting to observe though no one witnessed them those moments a silence full of deep expression which united in one side t souls most disposed to understand each other and who by no means objected to the quite meditation enjoyed together
in a word malicorne philosopher that he was though he knew it not had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in the midst of play and with desire in the assurance of possession
in this manner therefore without leaving her room and having no confidant she was able to return to her apartment thus removing by her appearance a little tardy perhaps the suspicions of the most determined sceptic
but the door remained close and neither sight agnan norther painter peered nor did the hangs e move
c then dearest love said the king to return quickly
no no not today sire
i knew but too well that you had not ceased to love me
the vary with a gesture partly of extreme terror and partly as if invoking a blessing attempted to speak but cannot articulate one word
at the moment however when the king threw himself on his knees a cry of utter despair rank through the corridor accompanied by the sound of retreating footsteps
the captain sitting buried in his leather armchair his spurs fixed in the floor his sword between his legs was reading a number of letters as he twist his moustache
d'artagnan uttered a welcome full of pleasure when he perceived his friend's son
well my boy he said by what a lucky incident does it happen that the king has recalled you
these words did not sound agreeably in the young man's ears who as he seated himself reply upon my word i cannot tell you all that i knows i have come back hum
that the king has not recalled you and you have returned
i did not understand that at all
raoul was already pale enough and he now began to turn his hat round and round in his hand
what they dose is the matters that you look as you do and what makes you so dumb
said the captain do people nowadays as soon that sort of airs in england
i have been in england and came here again as lively as a chaffinch
you not say something
i have too much to say
ah how is your father
forgive me my dear friend i was going to excuse that
d'artagnan increased his sharpness of his penetrating gaze which no secret was capable resisting
you are happy about something he said
i am indeed and you know the reason very well monsieur d'artagnan
nay do not pretend to the a stones
i am not pretending to be astonished my frio
i have neither head nor arm do not despise but help me ino words im the most wretched of living beings oh
she is deceiving ill said d'artagnan not a muscle of whose face had moved those are big words who makes use of them
everyone ah
if everyone says so there must be some truth in it
not for a friend for a son
i do take it you are really l from curiosity
no it is not from curiosity is is from love
cut another big word
i tell you i love louise to distraction
well suppose it were only that
no sensible man ever succeeded in making much of a brain when the head was turned
i have completely lost my senses in the same way a hundred times in my life
you would hear but you would not understand me you would understand but you would not obey me
oh try tie
i go far even if i were unfortunate enough to know something and foolish enough to communicate it to you you are my friend you say indeed yes
very good i should quarrel with you
i never complain as you know but as heaven and my father would never forgive me for blowing out my brain i will go and get the first person i meet to give me the information which you withhold i will tell him he lies and and you a killum
and a fine affair that would be so much the better what should i care
you now assume a different ton instead of killing you will get kill yourself i suppose you mean very fine indeed
how much i should regret you
of course i shall go about all day saying ah
what a fine stupid fellow that brag alone was
as great as stupid as i ever met with
go then gran go and get yourself disposed of if you like
i hardly knew who can have taught you logic but deuce take me if your father has not been regularly robbed of his money
will buried it facing his hands murmuring no n i have not a single friend in me world
i don't fancies monsieur i do not laugh at you though i am a gascon
a carpenter what do you mean
upon my word i did not know someone told me there was a carpenter who made an opening through a certain floor
why don't know where
in whose room them
i have told you for the last hour that i know nothing of the whole affair
but the painter then de portrait
while you see to him only that name in your mouth
i do that suppose it will concern you
yes you're right and he made a step or two as if he were going to lead wh are you going
to love for someone who attend me be true
who is that a woman
you wish to be consoled by someone and you will be so at once she will tell you nothing ill herself of course so be off
you are mistaken monsieur replied raoul the women i mean will tell me all the evil she possibly can
well i admit it
and in point the fact why should i play with you as a cat does with the poor mouth
you distress me you do indeed
wait if you can
i could not so much doe worse
ay said raoul snatching eagerly at the pen which the captain held out him
how very fortunate that is he was looking for you too
she said in the same tone of voice it is not i who am going to speak to him oh then
