as i approached a city i heard bells ringing and little later i found the street to stir with throngs of well dressed people in family groups winding their way hither and thither
looking about me i saw a gentleman in a neat black dress smiling and his hand extended to me with great cordiality
he must have realized i was a stranger and wished he tendered his hospitality to me i accepted it gratefully i clasped his hand he pressed on him
we gazed for a moment slightly into each other's eyes
of course you are going there too i said to my friendly guide
yes he answered i cannot the worship i am a priest
an idle i whispered taken by surprise
they worship god they did not exist
but the greeks love their gods i protested my heart clamly my breast
no i said in a low voice
he was an idle then and not a god
it may appen to see of light it created the beautiful the true the good yes our religion was divine
it had only one fault interrupted my guide what was that
i inquired without knowing what his aunts would be it was not true
produce him
i wish me to myself what blast for me
then taking heart i told my guide how more than once i had felt apollo's grating at presence in my heart and told him of the immortal lines of homer concerned the divan hollo
do you doubt homer
i said to him homer the inspired bard
no no apollo is not an idle
he is a god and a son of a god
the air was heavy with incense a number of men and gorgeous vestments were passing to and fro thou and a kneeling before the various lights and images
observing my anxiety to understand the mean of all this my guy took me aside and in a whisper told me that the people were celebrating the anniversary of the birth the other beautiful savior jesus the son of god
forgit apollo he said with his suggestion of severity his voice
there is no such person he was only an idle
if he would as search for apollo in all the universe would never find e one answering to his name or description
i wont doe jesus i hasten turning toward him
will he not be here this morning
will he not speak to his worshippers i asked again
will he not permit them to touch him to caress his hand to class was divine feet to inhere the ambrosial fragrance of his breath to bask in the golden light of his eyes to hear the music of his immaculate accents
i asked my eyes feel with wonder in my voice quitting with excitement
would not that then i venture to ask impatiently make jesus as much of an idle is apollo
and if faith that jesus is a god prue him a god wh will not faith in apollo make him a god
but i am determined not only to know if it is possible the whole truth about jesus but also to communicate that truth through others
but there is mar of a moral tonic in the open and candid discussion of a subject like the one in hand th in the multitude of platitudes
i never to live or lecture in which i do not either directly or indirectly if full and free expression to my faith in everything that is worthy of faith
if i do not believe in dogma it is because i believe in freedom

let us place ourselves entirely the hands of the evidence
as intelligent beans were desire to know where this jesus whose wor she was not only costing the world millions of the people's money but which is also drawing to his service a time the energies the affections the devotions and the labor humanity is a myth or reality
a number of other dates were observed with a christian church of various times as the birthday of jesus the goss give no date and appeared to be quite uncertain really ignorant about it
yet there is no evidence that he was born on that day
why this discrepancy an historical document to say nothing about inspiration
again matty says that to escape the evil designs of herod mary and josephs with the infant jesus fled into egypt loops has nothing about this hurried flight nor of herod's intention to kill the infant messiah

but in the absence of evidence or in offers of following metaphysical arguments against this typical slices one
if we are to have any mythology at all he seems to argue why object to adding to it the miss of jesus
the immediate companions of jesus appeared to be on other hand as mythical as he is himself
who was matthew who was mark
who were john peter judas and merry
there is absently no evidence that they ever existed
if peter ever went to rome with the new doctrine how is it that no historian has taken note of him
here again we see the presence of a myth
he was the only one who saw them
peter paul john james judas i'll keep o the stage almost exclusively
it is impossible to explain why the contemporaries of jesus the authors in the historians of this time you not take notice of him
could they have been a conspiracy against him
how u is his unanimous sides be account for
how then are we to decide which the numerous candidates for divine honors should be human our votes
and such a faith is never free it is always maintained but a sword now and by hell far hereafter
yet the most impossible utterances are put in juice mouth
only a mythical jesus could virtually hand over the govern of levers to corners who have petitions to press upon his attention
moreover if jesus could keep his promise there would be today no misery in the world no orphans no childless mothers no shipwrecks no floods no famines no disease no crippled children no insanity no wars no crime no wrong

self effort and not prayer is a really against ignorance slavery poverty and more degradation
it was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity when with impressible persons love becomes sol sisters ness hope sins to misgiving and faith to hope when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret and opportunities for ambition that have been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise

then a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the fifth window
the river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort which races middle and sides with the same delighting precision any irregularities of speed being immediately corrected by a small whirlpool
the window was struck a gain in the same manner

mister lennox had never had the o pe humanity of having any pointed conversation with a father after her refusal or else that would indeed the a very serious affair
but she soon felt it was not about anything which having only lately and suddenly occurred could have given rise to any complicated thoughts and her father wished to spect to her
mister hale did not answer for me doted
margaret could not bead the sight of the suspense which was even more distressing to her father than to herself
but why dear paa do tell me

i have bone long with south repose th would have roused any mind less tub and cowardly than mine
he shook his head as he went on
margaret i cried to do it i cried to content myself as simply refusing the dis prevalent and stopping quietly here stranding my conscience now as i had strained it before
god forgive me
he rose and walked up and down the room speaking no words of self reproach and humiliation of which margaret was thankful to hear but a few
margaret i return to the all said burden we must leave helstone

mister hale shook his head despondingly he pressed her hand in token of attitude
margaret p nearly upset again into a burst of prime
to durn her thoughts she said now tell me papa what up mana

margaret was all the stand
but she recovered herself repeatedly

the coats pretty ear to the key hall and listen
at first he heard the sign of indifferent voices then anemic loan's voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silence then both voices together with glad intonations and then fruit steps

the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading their cleanliness and discipline
the regiments had entered and left a tone with their bands playing and by the grand it's orders the men had marched all the wee in step a practice on which the guards prided themselves the officers on foot and at their proper pulse
borace had been cars and had marched all the way with burg who was already in combin of a company
bors during the campaign had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become acquainting with prince andrew bolkonski though whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in chief stuff
burg and bors having rested after yesterday's march were sitting clean and neatly dressed at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them plain chess
well how are you going to get out of that he remarked
at that moment door open
dear me how you have changed
he was about to embrace his friends but nicholas avoided him
he wanted to pinch him push him do anything but kiss him a think everybody did

i'll don't mention it coes i quite understand said berg getting up and speaking in a muffled in guttural voice
gore cross to our cos they invited you added boris
burton the keenest of courts without a spot or speck of dust stood before a looking glass and brushed the heir on his temples upwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and having insured himself from the way rostov looked at it that his court had been noticed left the room with a pleasant smile
oh dear what a beast i are muttered rostov as he read a letter why
well have you saint gabriel for some white all right lace house
in the letter from his parents was enclosed the letter of recommendation to bagration which the old countess at ana mihalovna's advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him take it to hiss destination and make use of it
why have you thrown that away asked boris
its some letter of recruit what the devil do i wanted for
he looked intently un inquiringly into his friend's eyes evidently trying in v to find the answer to some question
which you believe it cod i was not at all alarmed cause i knew i wash right
i came forwards burke stood up and showed how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self complacency then hissed it
well he stormed it me as the saying is stormed and stormed and stormed
it was not a matter of life but rather of death as the same is
albans and devils and two siberia said burg with a sagacious smile
still i remain silent what are you think coat
the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day
that's the wee coat said burke lighting his pipe an emitting lings a small
yes i was fain had rostov small
rostov with a truthful young man and wher no account have told a deliberate lie
he began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened the imperceptibly involuntarily and inevitably he elapsed into falsehood
prince andrew who liked to help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed towards bors who had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what young man wanted
this spate of prince andrew's disagreeable ironical torn in spate of the contemn with which rostov from his fading army pointedly guarded all these little adjutant on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one rostov fell confused blushed and became silent
ors inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without indiscretion one may ask about our plans
we shall probably advanced replied bolkonski evidently reluctant to see more in the presence of a stranger
burg at the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as which remote the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled
i was stair said rostov angry as if intending to insulting e the camp
with a slightly contemptuous smile he said yes that im many stories now told them at that afar
but our stories of the stories of men who have been under the enemy's fire
o our stories have some wheat not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get the wars without doing anything
however he added rising you now my name and were to find me we don't forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted and as a man order than you my advices to let the matter drop
exclaimed prince andrew and was boat of them both he went out
and he was still more angry at having omitted to sears
he ordered his horse at once and coldly tak him leave a bors wode home
should he go to head quarters next he and challenge that ef fated adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that

and unless i speak unto thee say not thou one word either
and though thou shouldst desire to see my defeat in my death by the hands of those men yet do i feel no dread
and he received him and that not feebly
and saying not one word unto me unless i speak first unto thee
i will do as far as i can lord said she according to die desire
i made an said he it is vain to a temper seating forward
i cannot by any means refrain from sleep through weariness said he do thou therefore wash the horses and sleep not
and when she saw the dawned day appear she looked around her to see if he were waking and thereupon he woke
and they left the wood and they came to an open country with meadows on one hand and mo was mowing the meadows
my lord he added will be displeasing to bee if i ask whence thou comest also
wilt thou fowl my counsel said the you can take thy meal for me
what sort of meal he inquired
then they washed and took their repast

and after they had eaten and drank drain went to sleep and so did e it also
the date seem unam point but thrill the period the offices and men of the ship had been unremittingly busy
bows attack the ship stores surveyed re listen rested them saving very much space by un stowing numerous cases and stowing the contents in the lazarette
without steam the leak canal be kept under with the hand pump by two daily aits of a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes
as the ship was and in her present heavily late in condition would certainly have taken three to four hours each day
the large green tent was put up and prop supports made for it
the eng room's staff and ac's people on the engines scientist was stowing their laboratories the cook refitting his galley and so with not a single spot but had its band of workers
the men space such as it is therefore extends from the fore hatch the stem on the main deck
under the forecastle of stalls of fifteen ponies the maximin the space would hold the narrow irregular space in fronts packed tight with fatter
neatly behind the forecastle volcanoes a small booby hatch the only interest to the men's mastic and bad weather
about the four hatch is the ace house
we manage to get three tons of ice one hundred sixty two carcases of mutton and three carcases of beef beside some boxes of sweetbreads and kidneys into this space
the sacs containing this last added to the goods already mentioned make a really heavy deck kao and one is naturally anxious concerning it but everything that can be done by lashing in securing has been done
forage i originally ordered thirty tons of compressed oaten hay from melbourne
the scene is wholly enchanting and such a view from some sheltered sunny corner in a garden which blazes with masses of red in golden flowers tends to feelings of inexpressible satisfaction with all things
a great mass of people assembled
can i lunch with a party in the ne zeal and company ship ru ph
telegram to say tero ovah had arrived sunday night
a third sledge stand across the break of the poop in the space hitherto occupied by the after w
the quantities to in half tons and the space occupied considerable
the ship was over two feet by the stern but this will soon be remedied
they must perforce be chained up and they had given what shelters afforded on deck but their position is not enviable
it is a pathetic attitude deeply significant of cold and misery occasionally some poor beast ams a long pathetic wine
there are generally wanted two on watch which uses matters but it is a squash
later in the day the wind his vade to the westward heading us slightly
oates and atkinson with intermitting assistance or mothers were busy keeping the ponies on their legs
there was nothing forward but to grapple with the evil and nearly all hands were laboring for hours in the wights of the ship heaving coal sacks overboard in relishing the petrol cases et cetera and the best man ipso such difficulty and dangerous circumstances
no sooner with some semblance of order restored th some exceptionally heavy way would tear away the lashing and the work had to be done all over again
from this moment above for m the eng room became the centre of interest
the wat again in spite of every effort
the outlook apaid grim
the amount of water which was being made with the ships so roughly handled was most uncertain
williams had to confess was beaten and must draw fires what was to be done
the built pomps depended on the main engine
on one occasion i was way deep and standing on the rail of the poop
the after god were organized in two parties by evans to work buckets the men were kept steadily going on the choked hand pumps this seemed all that could be done for the moment and what a magic account as the soul safe got of the ship from sinking practically an attempt to bil out
occasionally a heavy sea would bear one of them away and he was only saved by his chain
the far had taken this morning meal and now lay curled up on a bed of moss
we never the fawn cot up he was quite contain to frisk about
the danger was certain now it was near
the howls had struck a twel where she turned and the fawn was see
one was rolling the other had a gun in his hand what should she do
her tired lakes could not propel the tip body rapidly
the g saw the boat nearing her
in the moment more the boat was on her and the man at the oars had leaned over and cut her
i was tormented by thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctor's orders
that old m ceased to give so much annoyance yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams
phil i given them orders not to speak to me of this
this maid had stolen from me certain little things of some importance and in her fear being detected she would have been very glad if i had died
accordingly she allowed me twice to take as much as i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask full i then covered myself and began to sweat and fell into a deep sleep
they say that my poor friend was on the point of falling to the ground so graved was he to hear this
afterwards he took an agly state and began to beat the serving girl with all his mind shouting out ahhh traitress you have killed him for me then
she may did have saved my life so led me a helping hand for i have sweated and be quick about it
flic recovered his spirits dried and makee me comfortable and i been conscious of a great improvement in my state began to reckon on recovery
just then the other doctor bernardino put in his appearance who at the beginning of my illness had refused to bleed me
my different chest goes that most able name exclaimed oh power of nature
she knows what she requires and the physicians know nothing
that sim bruton my rubber nino made us say if he had drunk another bottle he would have been cured upon the spot
afterwards he turned to me and ass if i could have drunk more water
i answered no because i had entirely pointed my thirst
in like manner she was asking for what she wanted when the poor young men bagged you to bleed him
if you knew that is recovery depended upon his drinking two flasks on water why did you not say so before
you might then have boasted of his kill
at this words the wretched quite sulkily departed and never showed his face again
the very evening i was taken with great precautions in a chair well wrapped up and protected from the cold
do not permitting any irregularities for though he has escaped this time another disorder now would be the death of him
then he turned to me and said my benvenuto be prudent comme no excesses and when you are quite recovered i beg you to make me a madonna with your own hand and i will always pay my devotes to it for your sake
so i made my mind up and prepared to travel
that day many friends came to see me among others pierre lari who was the best a dearest friend i ever had
next day that came a certain nicolo da monte auto who was also a very great friend of mine
i had harboured him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house upside down for the man was subject to a species of dry scar which he was always in the habit of scratching with his head
meanwhile that able physician francesco d monarchy attended to m cure with great skill
there they sided me to wait until the duke went by
many of my friends at court came up to greet me and expressed surprised that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shattered by illness they said that i ought to have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke
at this words margino the duke's taylor made his way through all those gentlemen and said if that's all you want to know you shall know it at this very moment
george a painter whom i have mentioned happen just then to pass and my esto agostino exclaimed there is the man who accused you now you know yourself if it be true or not
as fiery as i could not being able to leave my seat i asked george if it was true that he had accused me
he denied that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sword
my augustino retorted you gallows bird
don't you know that i know it for most certain
george made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me
then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted
the duke gazed at me and marvel i was steal alive afterwards he vade me take he to be an honestest man and regain my hells
when i reached home nicolo da monte alto came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin written with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards take french leaf because my joy came from a quarter and a man who was able to destroy me
i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had injured me and told him all the affair about the min
he repeated get hands as quickly as you can and be of good courage for you will see your vengeance executed sooner than you expect
i the best attention to my health gave pierre throw bag lo advice about stamping the coins and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else
you want them to immortalizes that ferocious tyrant
you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you i will inveterate foe and their devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mine to hang you without any fault of yours
it was firmly believed that duke alessandro was the son of pope clement
mister francesco used also to say and swear by all his saints that if he could he would have robbed me of the dies for that meadow
i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more
i thou sent to florence to request lorn senor that he would send me the reverse of the meadow
nicolo da monte grotto to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher lud sey not for it he had replied he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better invent one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bring it without hesitation to the duke for this would be to my advantage
i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate impressed the worth forward to my best ability
this being so as he was a fellow of much humour we used often to laugh together about the great credit he had gained
i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling peas ready and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball
i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to hat my mark at two hundred cubits which cannot be done by other ways of loading
i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we made haste for rome
we have succeeded in amassing two hundred ounces of silver enough i trust to erect a handsome bronze figure
to be sure it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priest is boasting about i could live at ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose
but the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrades thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of cana
here there is an arm of the sea w is crossed in fairy boats that start as sooner some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked
when the boatmen and passengers heard the splash and saw the prete struggling in the water they were afraid and made every effort to save him but the wind was fair and the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him
when he saw this the room feigned the utmost grief and dismay and said to his fellow passengers this priest whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kyoto to visit the shine of his patron and as i happened to have business there as well we settled to travel together
now las by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone
he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believed a story i pitied and tried to comfort him
then the roan and said to the boatmen
what thank you gentlemen added he turning to the ugly travellers
they of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their onwards journey and all with one voice agreed to what the ran and had proposed and so the matter was settled
when at length they reached the shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the ran overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priests luggage and putting it with his own pursued his journey to kiote
fortune favouring his speculations he began to a mask great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself nothing and in the course of time he married a wife who bore him a child
since then allay gone well with me yet had i not been poor i had never turned assassin nor thief
he would have fled into the house but the ghost stretched forth its withered arm and clutching the back of his necks scow at him with a vindictive glare and a hideous ghastliness of mean so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear
at length undone by such ceaseless vexation took bay fell ill and kept muttering o misery misery the wandering priest is coming to torture me
now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest who lodged in the next street
and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all over
three years ago at the koona fery you flung me into the water and well you remember it
happily continued the priest i had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so i reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded and setting up a bronze figure to buddha dus fulfilling the wish of my heart
on my journey homewards i took a lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvelous ailment
thinking i could divine its cause i came to see you and am glad to find i was not mistaken
and would it not ill become me to bear malice
repent therefore an abandon your evil ways
to see you do so i should esteem the height of happiness
be of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that i am really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you
in a fit of madness i was tempted to kill and bio
fortune befriended me ever after but the richer i grew the more keenly i felt how wicked i had been and the more i foresaw that my victim's vengeance would some day overtake me
haunted by this thought i lost my nerve till one night i beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill
but how you manage to escape in her still alive is more than i can understand
a guilty man said the priest with a smile shudders at the rustling of the wind or the chattering of a stork speak a murderer's conscience praise upon his mind till he sees what is na
every well ordered jap from his home with the old fashioned kind has its little chinee which is the centre of the religious life of the house

all these are put together by the careful mother and preserved as jealously as queen al be kept the charge stick that governed the destiny of her son
as the children arrived years of discretion these treasures pass out of the mother's faithful keeping into the hands of their actual owners and there usually kept stored away in some little use drawer or cabinet until death removes the necessity for any further safeguards over life

for the greater events of family life the home prophesies are felt to be too uncertain whom this services of the fortune teller must be called him
no well managed family would thinker building a new house without finding in what direction to pace the front door
after this manner has been settled in the house is fairly begun there are occasional crises in its construction upon which much depends
of these the most important is the day when the roof was raised
the house owner then besides whether the day set by the builder is a looking one for himself and his family
a present of money to eat workmen is also in order and will conduce to the rapid and faithful execution of the jabot ha when at last the house is finished in carpenters and plasters already to leave that the local firemen who have assisted all along in the building as unskilled laborers often ascend to the roof and from the ridgepole cast down cakes for which the children and the neighborhoods scrambled joyfully
all come who can and those who cannot come send servants provisions
on the day after the death often in the evening the body must be placed in the cask shaped cough and net until recently was a style commonly a using japan
now among the wealthier classes the long coffin has superseded the small square or round one but the smaller expense connected with the burial in the old way makes a survival of an old type u necessity for the majority of japanese
at an appointed time all the relatives assemble in the death chamber and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse
theres no official ceremonial morning of parents for their children nor does custom require them to perform any of the last rights or attend the funeral
upon the younger brothers and sisters falls the duty of attending to all the last sad ministrations
when the body has been washed as as dressed in white in sil cabin whenever the family can afford it
the body to be placed in the coffin must be folded into a sitting posture and the chin resting upon the knees the position of the mummies found in many aboriginal american tombs
this difficult to us apparently impossible feet safely accomplished there are placed in the coffin in number of small things that the dead takes with him to the next world
the single exception to this rule about metal is that small copper coins may be put in to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death
last of all the vacant spaces in the coffin are filled in with bags of tea
so long as the coffin is in the house it must be watched over continually
it is their duty to see that the incense burning before the coffin is never allowed to go out while the food for the dead is renewed regular intervals by the mourners themselves
there are few enlightened japanese who will defend the present system of cruelty to the afflicted or who do not long for some change but so great as the force of conservatism in this regard so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack of respect for the dead that reform advances slowly
individual instance as occur in which some of the worst features of these customs are modified
a case and point is that of the late mister fuca cara a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countryman in modern ways and who in his death continued his teaching
in his will he provided that his body was to be buried without washing in the clothing in which he died
through those growing feeling and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies
just before the processions starts or religious ceremony is held at the house which h attended by the friends of the deceased and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery
on the day of the burial great bunches of natural flowers are sent to the dead each bunch so large as to regard the services one man to carry it
sometimes with the gift a man is sent to take part in the possession but if the giver fields too pour to higher man this burden too falls upon the bereaved household for etiquette requires that all flowers sent be borne to the grave by uniform coolies wh march in the funeral train
another favorite president at this time among buddhists is a cage of living birds too be borne to the grave and released thereon
it seems more like a bridal than a burial
during this period the spirit of the deceased is supposed to be still inhabiting the house and a tablet or shyness set up in the death chamber before which food and flowers are renewed daily
he tied that gan ashore a few days and came up the garda where i then resided he was apparently without any business that would support him but he soon became acquainted with my son thomas with whom he hunted for a long time and made his home with him at my house winter came on and he continued his day

allen made his rouses himself and then built a raft on which he wet doub the river to his own place at mont maris
there an indian gave him some refreshment and a good gun with which he hastened on to little beards down where he found his core
not ding to risk himself at that place for fear of being given up he made her but a short visit and came immediately to guard

the church bells were ringing and people on the avenue going by to service turned curious inquiring looks up at the great house and then went on talking with the recent events which had so strangely entered into and made history in the city
and all through his impassion appeal this morning there was a note of sadness and rebuke and stern condemnation that made many of the members pale with self accusation or with inward anger
raymond had voted to continue for another year the saloon

what if he had begun to do as jesus would have done long ago
when had the first church yielded to such a baptism of tears
what had become of its regular precise conventional order of service undisturbed by any vulgar emotion and unmoved by any foolish excitement

the meeting was tender it glowed with the spirits presence it was alive was strong and lasting resolved to begin a war on the whisky power in raiment that would break its rig forever

i will be guarded by your judgment in the matter
i am sure that whatever you and this page thank best will be right
under the circumstances i have a great distaste for what seems like display at such times but this seems different
it happened that that afternoon a somewhat noted newspaper correspondent was passing ther grimm on his way to an editorial convention in a neighboring city
she was a common street drunkard and yet the services of the tent were as impressive as any i ever witnessed in a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen
it struck me of course being a stranger in the place with considerable astonishment to hear voices like those one naturally expects to hear only in great churches or concerts at such a meeting as this
mister maxwell spoke at the fact that the dead woman had been fully prepared to go but he spoke in a peculiarly sensitive manner of the effect of the liquor business on the lives of men and women like this one
raymond of course being a railroad town and the center of the great packing interests for this region is full of saloons
then followed what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service
it was one of the symbols and at the same kim one of the most impressive sights i ever witnessed
there must have been a hundred of these women and i was told many of them had been converted at the meetings just recently
there was no answer and after one or two ineffectual attempts palsy turned fearfully away

i've been a lazy dog all my life and good for not but i hope i've not sunk to that
the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous rush of a starry eyed flush cheeked young woman who demanded
where is he pete miss billy gasped the old man
aunt hannah cheeks too were flushed in her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way pet had said miss billy's name
it was one matter for her to object to this thing billy was doing but quite another for pete to do it of course it's she
retorted aunt hanna testily as if you yourself bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night pete where is he
interposed billy tell mister bertram i am here or wait i'll go right it in surprise it
pet had recovered himself by now but he did not even glanced toward aunt hannah
miss billy miss billy you're an angel straight from heaven you are you are oh i'm so glad you came
it'll be all right now all right hastened the den miss billy
billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step towards the door at the end of the hall aunt hanna's indignant voice arrested her billy stopped
pete go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receive us pets lips twitched
but his face was preter naturally grave when he spoke
a flying figure brushed by him and fell on it seized by the couch with a low cry bertram's eyes flew open
dong ling found him there minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringe napkin that had been spread over bertrams tray
in the hall above aunt hannah was crying into william's gray went and duster that hung on the hall rack aunt hanna's handkerchief was on the floor back at hillside
then very gradually it dawned over them that there was after all something strange and unexplained it at all
as if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closer bertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable
why ah of course stammered dilly i couldn't help thinking that maybe you had found out you didn't want me
demanded bertram angry of mystified
as for my not painting again you did' understand pete dearie
she pulled herself half away from bertrams and circling arm
billy your quivering sigh
good heavens as kate and this too bertram's voice was savage now
well she wrote a letter
billy laughed gaily but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes
and you never did think for a minute billy that you cared for him
he had not been slow to marked that swift lowering for eyelids
billy was so glad bertram had turned the question on her love instead of ark rights
after a minute billy stirred and sighed happily
you see i wasn't in love with mister arkwright
and and you didn't care it speciall be for from miss win up
billy put a soft finger on his lips
bertrand kissed the finger and subsided hoop he commented
well what is that is that kate too demanded bertram grimly
there was another silence then suddenly bertram stirred
billy i'm going to marry you to morrow he announced decisively
i don't know as i can trust you out of my sight till then you'll read something or here something or get a letter from kate after breakfast tomorrow morning that will set you saving me again and i don't want to be saved that way
i'm going to marry you to morrow i'll get he stopped short with a sudden frown con found that law i forgot
five days indeed sir
i wonder if you think i can get ready to be married in five days
don't want you to get ready retorted bertram promptly i saw marie it ready and i had all i wanted of it
if you really must have all those miles of table cloths and napkins and doilies and lace ruff lings will do it afterwards not before but
besides i need you to take care of me cut in bertram craftily
the tender glow on billy's face told its own story and bertram's eager eyes were not slow to read it
sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm
billy my dear
it was aunt hanna's plaintive voice at the doorway a little later
we must go home and will you is here too and wants to see you
you mean it'll be before october
aunt hana glanced from one to the other uncertainly
yes nodded billy de merely
yes i know that is a good while cut in bertram marly
we wanted it to morrow what we had to wait on account of the new license law
yet so strong was the effect upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectation of the word which should make him rich
a part of that impression was due to be engagement which he must now fulfil
to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes
because in his salad days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many charms step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that roar attachment
unable to think of work he left the house and wandered glumly about legions park
he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marian who was fats instrument
he wrote to marian
will you let me here or come and seen
i scarcely thought of beer as likely to kill himself
but why the juice did he go all the way hel there
i hoped he would bring me subdues
poverty i can only suppose
but i will see weal down i hadn't come across biffin for a long time
was he still so merry poor
asked amy compassionately
i'm afraid sigh his book failed utterly
oh if i had imagined him still in such distress surely i might have done something to help you
perchance his death was impart attributable to that hopeless love
he sent me a copy of his novel she said and i saw him once or twice after that
having this subject to converse upon put the two more quickly at east than could otherwise have been the case
amy might take a foremost place among ling women
especially now that her father is threatened with blindness
is it so serious
even if mister yule recovers his side it is not at all likely that he will be able to work as before
our difficult is a so grave that
he paused and let his hand failed despondently
i have a good deal of will you remember and what i have set my mind upon no doubt i shall some day achieve
there was poms
the last three years he continued have made no slight difference in my position
recall where i stood when you first knew be
just now i am in needed of a little encouragement
you don't notice any fooling off at my work recently
did you see my things in the current and so on generally
sometimes i believe i have detected you when there was no signature
her storing in that girl's paper has attracted attention
and i could so easily put her at rest by renouncing all claim upon her
i surmise that that you yourself would also be put at rest by such a decision
jon look at me with that ironical smile he pleaded
i couldn't know about declaring that i was heart broken in any event i must be content for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgments are pretty sure to be unfavourable what can i do
the case is too delicate i fear for my advice
well i'll go back to my script
again jasp beheld the white soft handed for a superfluous moment
yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry
barin could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companions smooth countenance
she had divined that there was some grave reason for this sums and the paining with which she approached was half caused by the anxious beats of her heart
he began abruptly
he gave her such details as he had obtained then added
there were two of my companions fallen in the battle
i ought to think myself a lucky fell marry what
you were better fitted to fight your way jasper
more of the great remained
here no very well i don't
i have made up my mind about our affairs he went tom presently
yes
will you marry them and let us take their chains
you feel yourself indispensable to your father at present
i should be so afraid of the effect upon his health jasper
she paused and looked up at him touchingly
dear i can't feel it would be my duty to renounce she because my father had become blind
has one thing occurred to you
will he consent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is missus milvain
and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him
she listened anxiously and reflected
as i have said there is a very serious doubt whether your father would accept money for you when you will my wife
it isn't your fault marian and well then there's only one thing to do
excepted jasper that if father is helpless i must find means of assuring his support
do you think them insurmountable
that is just what i have decided his impossible marion you shall have the plain truth
i don't trust myself
but shall you face them willingly
put up your own bella marian
what do i care for a drop of vain she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is at stake how am i to understand you
every word you speak seems intended to dishearten me
why need you conceal if that is the truth
is that what you meed by saying you distrust yourself
we must see each other again marian
how am i to live an hour in such uncertainty as this
i do wish it
her emotion had an effect on him and his voice trembled
there is no natural law that a child should surrender everything for her parents
you know so much more of the world th i did can't you advise me
this that no way of provoking for my father
good god this is frightful marian i can't stand it
i will be faithful to you
he had made a pretence of holding his umbrella over her but marian turned away and walked to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a great tree her face averted from him
moving to follow he saw that her frame was shaken by soundless sobbing
in what can there be more selfishness
but i couldn't say on word that would seem to invite such misery as this
you don't love me jasper and that's an end of everything
happiness or misery come to us by fight
is it in my power to make you happy
but if you had said you loved me before that i should have it always to remember
if i believe anything i believe that i did love you
what can you say to me more than you have said now
remember me as a man who disregarded priceless lu such as yours to go and make himself a proud position among fools and knaves indeed that will it come to
soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merited my perverse pride would revolt against it
what can be simpler than the truth
it is a thing that happens every day either in a man or woman and all would honor demands is the courage to confess the truth
marianne will you do this will you let her engagement last another sixpence not without how meeting during that time
that seems to be childish
the rain fell unceasingly and with it began to mingle an autumnal mist
jasp laid a moment then asked calmly
are you going to the museum yes
go home again for this morning marian you can't work
they must and i have no time to lose
goodbye she gave him her hand
they looked at each other for an instant then marian left the shelter of the tring opened her umbrella and walked quickly away
jasper did not watch her he had the face of a man who was suffering a severe humiliation
her sister said very little for she recognised genuine suffering in his times an aspect
a fear weeks ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest affection but who is very rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him
yester no morning he received her final answer by refusal
you will understand they surely you needed no fresh proof how utterly unworthy he iss of you
you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you
several days passed before there came a reply
i must only ask that you will write to me without the least reference to these troubles tell me always about yourself and be sure that you cannot tell me too much
we had been but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of the covenant which was requisite for determination of the problem
several different parties were therefore organized to examine the various routs suppose to be practicable within the northern end southern limits of united states
the only discrimination made was in the more probed and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the surveys
he inquiries were made with regard to good powder which subsequently led to the use of a coarser grain for artillery
the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil wife
under instructions from the president the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution
after some further discussion of the question the visitors withdrew dissatisfied with the result of the interview
the quartermaster general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake at the appointed to the office had been confounded with his father who was a well known whig but that he the son was a democrat
i assured the general that this was altogether immaterial adding that it was a very pretty quarrel as it stood and that i had no a desire to affect a settlement of it on any inferior issue
nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the foxhound a very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size
if you want to hunt your harriers on foot sixteen inches is quite big enough almost too big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches as a useful height or even nineteen inches
it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule asked color it is so much a matter of individual taste
but puppies are usually sent out to walk and may easily be procured to be captain reared until they old enough to be hindered to their work
he is of course finer but with the length of neck so perfect in the bigger hound the little shoulders of the same pattern and the typical quarters and second fives
and when he is fairly on a line of course he sticks to it as the saying is like a beagle
it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otterhound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of good eighteen inches can in almost at dental contemporary that was called the essex beagle
that a great many of the true order were bred became very manifest as soon as the harrier and eagle association was formed and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hound show was reserved for them
then they seemed to spring from every part of the country
one hears now of the jost him the house to place very noted indeed the halting the lee park the stoke place the eden burg the surbiton the trinity foot the wood dale missus judged hills missus prices and missus turners
eyes brown dark hazel poor hazel not deep set nor bulgy and with a mild expression
ears long set on low finding texture and hanging in a graceful fold close to the cheek
neck moderately long slyly arched the throat showing some du lap
shoulders clean and slightly sloping
forelegs quite street fell under the dog of good substance and round in the bone
feet round well knuckling up and strongly padded
coat smooth variety smooth very dense and not too fine or short
height not exceeding sixteen inches
all things which follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of god must always exist and be infinite or in other words are each hern and infinite through they said attribute
proof conceive if it be possible supposing the proposition to be denied that the something in some attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of these said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought
in its nature infinite
must necessarily exist
we have now granted therefore thought not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of god does not naturally follow from its nature in so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of god which is against our aphesis
and beyond the limits of the duration of the idea of god supposing the latter at some time not to have existed for not to be going to exist thought would perforce have existed without the idea of god which is contrary to our hypothesis for we suppose that thought being given the idea of god necessarily flowed there from
bearn mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from god's absolute nature
corollary hence it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is ins classic phraseology god is cause of the being of things as siny rem
corollary individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of god or modes by which the attributes of god are expressed in a fixed and definite manner
such a call such a time' never did see
i was wishing somebody would give the conversation of start we indian made break

never mind polly said jasper there's all next summer and after our winter and dressed in and all our hard work over music one of thee fine those had jaunt round again and his eyes glistened
and you'll go on drawing and painting till you get to be a great artist ran on polly enthusiastically and then well see something you've done in the loo maybe the loo cried adela oh dear me polly pepper
tom selwyn had been very sober during all this marry chatter and now in his seat across the narrow aisle he drummed his heels impatiently on the floor
what's up little mother asked tom in surprise at her unusual manner it's iss this tom
when the news was circulated as it was pretty soon that the party was not to be broken into it all till paris was a completed story the jubilation was such as to satisfy even tom
oh isn't it oates peas beans in barley girl cried polly as they watched them intently
and his long arm went out and picked a jacket end of an urchin who incautiously regarding such quiet travellers as not worth minding had hovered too near while trying to tease the girls
and presently a woman came and took little blue pinafore off and then the rest of the girls unclasped their hands and the ring melted away in the game was over
i'm glad the girls over here half fun said polly as grandpapa his party moved off isn't it nice to think they do
two or three days of rest at martin put everyone in good shape and gave them all a bit of time to pick up on many little things that worked behindhand
that's my third letter polly announced jasper on the other side of the table now i'm going to begin on jowls
one two said polly counting why i thought i'd written three while this one is most finished jasper
dare said tom delighted to thick that no terrible result had really ensued from his words that after they were out had scared him mightily
i'll post yours too polly give them here
then his face brightened and he said and she's right polly while polly fish took frank out of joe's little money bag that hung in her belts
do get the stamps pleased jasper and put them on and he took up her two letters and she gave the bag a little pat for joe's sake wishing it was his stubby black hair that her fingers could touch
i don't know where we are going to get nice whit paper far around robin said polly leaning her helpless on the table and her chin in her hands i know ejaculated tom whirling on his heel and dashing out
i want polly too said phronsie wriggling away from the pen that polly how out alluringly
phronsie who hadn't heard what polly said her small head being full of the responsibility of beginning the important letter and considering since it was to be done it was best to have it over with as soon as possible felt as scribbling a letters as fast as she could all them running downhill
it's all right grand ado like it he said
i tell you you don't know my grand daddy he's got locks to fun in him he added
i won't cry any more declared phronsie wiping off the last tear trailing down nose
then i shall be all as well as ever said polly kissing the wet little face
we must put them little pictures said polly try to make herself cheery as the work went busily on
paw you always do think of the best things exclaimed jasper beaming at her which made her try harder than ever to smile
i wouldn't feel so badly polly he managed to a spur when phronsie was absorbed with her work fell i could probably just his father did the chin bread boy
he seems to accomplish something every time he goes observed jasper dryly hullo just looking him now
oh dear me exclaimed adela as her scissors slipped now you've draggled the table again then she caught polly's eye
rather not much obliged tom bobbed his thanks
picture after picture cut from railroad guide books illustrated papers and it seemed to jasper gathered as if by magic with cunning little photographs broke up the letter and wound in and out with funny and charming detail of some of their journey
the rest of it is nice whispered jasper and a venture to say that he like that the best of all
mister king thought so too and he beamed at phronsie so you did he cried now that's fine i wish you'd write neal letter sometime
but what can i do so small and stupid and shy as i am
i must find some way to give the little ones a nice christmas
ta will like to have me go of him and singing while he places harp in the streets
yes i will try and then if i do well will l a one shall have a miry christmas
but see van it is cold in the streets the wind bites and the snow freezes one fingers
she thanked tommo and ran away to get ready for she felt sure her father would not release her anything
then she washed out little rance's frock and put it to dry because she would not be able to do at the next day
she longed to make the beds and dressed the children over night she was in such a hurry to have all in order but as that could not be she sat down again and tied over all the song she knew
when she had told her plan peter beni shook his head and thought it would never do motes begged so hard he consented at last that she should try it for one a week and sent her to bed the happiest little girl in new york
as soon as her father was gone tessa flew about and put everything and nice order telling the children she was going out for the day and they were to mind tum was mother who would see about the fire in the dinner for the good woman lef tessa and entered into her little plans with all her heart
port s's heart beat fast as she trudged away with tumble who slung his harp over his shoulder and gave her his hand
it was rather a dirty hand but so kind that tessa clung to it and kept looking up at the friendly brown face for encouragement
say now have no fear give them bell monica that is marian will make the laugh whispered tommo tuning his hart
when fiddled french but nodded to her and it seemed to help her very much for she began to sing before she thought and that was the hardest part of it
but tumble shook his curly had and answered soberly yes i took you there first for their love music and h out our country but up among the great houses we shall not always do well
but she had made half a dollar for tumbler divided the money fairly and she felt rich with her share
her hands were covered with chilblains for she had no mittens but she had put them under her shawl and shuffled merrily away in her big boots feeling so gladly the week was over and nearly three dollars slafe in her pocket
how gave the streets were that day
how brisk everyone was and how bright the faces looked as people tried about with big baskets holly wreaths and young evergreens going to blossom into splendid christmas trees
but i can't so ill fill the socks all full and be happy s tessa as she looked wistfully into the gay stores and saw the heavy baskets go by
who knows what may happen if would you well return tommo nodding wisely for he had plan as well as tessa and kept chuckling over it as he charged through the might
we'll try one more street and then go home thou so tired little one
at the fourth some people let them singing all their songs and gave nothing
tessa felt so grateful that without waiting for tommo she sang her sweetest little song all alone
i'll asked mamma said rose and away she went into the dining room close by
as the door opened test sal what looked to her like a fairy feast all silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine and tall glass pictures and smoking dishes that smelt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfaction
ah yes i shall come with much gladness and play as never in my life before cried tommo with a flourish of the old cap that made the children laugh
give these to your brother said the fairy prince stuffing nuts and oranges and to test his hands
all so time so very kind i have no way to say thank you but runs shall be for you a heavenly angel and i will sing my hart out for your treat cried tessa folding the mittens as if she would say a prayer thankfulness if she knew how
she got up early to see if the socks were all right and there she found the most astonishing sight
four socks instead of three and by the fourth pinned out quite elegantly was a little dress evidently meant for her o warm woollen dress all made and actually with bright buttons on it
tessa screamed and danced in her delight and up tumbled all the children to scream the dance with her making a regular carnival it small scale
in her long stocking she found all sorts of treasures for tumble had stuffed it full of queer things and his mother had made ginger bed into every imaginable shape from fat pigs to full omnibuses
little lance is accepted with delight by the kind lady of her children and test a or in the song quite easily
arose from the crowd of children gathered to the festival
before they went home the kind mamma told tussis he should be her friend and give her motherly kiss which wm the child's heart and fin to set a p seal upon that promise
the senator took his seat in the pulpit with the minister on one side of him in the superintendent of the sunday school on the other
so oud were they by the presence of a living united state senator that during three minutes not a spit ball was thrown
after that they began to come to themselves by degrees and presently the spell was wholly gone and they were reciting verses and pony hair
the usual sunday school exercises were hurried through and then the minister got up and board the house with a speech built on the customary sunday school plan then the superintendent put in his oar and then the town dignitaries had there say
am i am some populous centre of my own country where the choicest children of the land have been selected and brought together as at affair for a prize no
then where am i yes where am i
my soul is lost in wonder at the thought
earth has no higher no grander position for me
then what is it what did my consciousness reply
ah think of that now i could hardly keep the tears back i was so grateful
they could not give him a costly education but they were good and wise and they sent him to the sunday school he loved the sunday school
i hope you love your sunday school i see by your faces that you do that is right
always love your teachers my children for they love you more than you can know now
and by and by the people made him governor and he said it was all owing to the sunday school
why the people gave him a towering illustrious position a grand imposing position
it was senator of the united states
that poor little boy that loved his sunday school became that man that man stands before you
above all things my children be honestest
whence er or daw worthy departed from cattle ville he left three dozen boys behind him arranging a campaign of life whose objective point was the united state senate
we lug is a delightful child
there was no their such child there never had been and there never would be
while ea's mother seraphim alexandrovna was sure that
blois his eyes were dark and large her cheeks or rosy her lips were made for kisses and for laughter
but it was not these chimes in volga that gave her mother the keenest joy
she felt cold with her husband
he was always fresh and cool with a frigid smile and wherever he passed cold current sink move in the air
it even seemed at capa alexandrovna that she was in love with her future husband and this made her happy
the bid was also good looking she was a tall dark eyed dark haired girl somewhat he made but very tactful
he had connections and his wife came a good influential people
this might at the proper opportunity prove useful
after their marriage there was nothing in the manner of sym mother loch to suggest anything wrong to his wife
later however when his wife was about to have a child sergeant loch established connections elsewhere of a light and temporary nature
spa alexandrovna found the sou and to her own astonishment not particularly her she awaited her infant with a restless anticipation that swallowed every other feeling
ser puma alexandrovna drifted farther and farther away from him
luka then ran away standing with her plump little legs over the carpets and hid herself behind the curtains near her bed
where is my baby girl the mother asked as she looked for l latch gun may believe that she did not see her
then she came out a little farther and her mother as though she had only just caught sight of her seized her by her little shoulders and exclaimed joyously here she is male chica
her mother's eyes glowed with passionate emotion
her mother went to hide
we lice turned away as though not to see but watch smug stealthily all the time
where is m on marca asked la lech ca
a smile of absolute bliss played on her red lips
mule goes getting near her mother's corner
her mother was growing more absorbed every moment by her interest in a game her heart beat with short quick strokes and she pressed even closer to the wall disarranging her hair still more
le lech cas suddenly glanced toward her mother's corner and screamed with joy
through the half close doors he heard the laughter the joyous outcries the sound of romping
even fedosya felt abashed now for her mistress now for herself
he liked coming here where everything was beautifully arranged this was done by spa alexandrovna who wished to surround her little girl from her very infancy only with the loveliest things
seraphim the ax and drama dressed herself tastefully this too she did for the lucco with the same end in view
one thing sergey modo bitch had not become reconciled to and this was his wife's almost continuous presence in the nursery
it's just as i thought i knew that i'd find you here he said with a deriving condescending smile
nearly you see that the child should feel its own individuality he explained in answer to seraph out sandro oa's puzzled plants
she still so little said spa alexandrovna
i don't insist it's your kingdom here
i'll think it over his wife answered smiling as he did coldly but genially
then they began to talk of something else
that the mistress does it while that's one thing but that the young lady does it that's bad
why asked pincio curiosity
this expression of curiosity gave her face the look of a wooding roughly painted doll
yes that's bad repeated agatho a conviction terribly bad well
it's the truth i'm saying remember my words agatha went on that the same assurance and secrecy
it's the surest sign
the old woman had invented this sign quite suddenly herself and she was evidently very proud of it
madam madam she said quietly in a trembling voice
seraph ma alexandrovna gave a start
theodosius face made her anxious
what is it fedosya she asked the break concern as there anything wrong with welch ca
no madam said fiducia she gesticulated with her hands to reassure her mistress and to make her sit down
the much beau a sleet may god v with her
only i'd like to say something you see well lu ges always hiding herself that is not good
i can't tell you how bad it is said fidel asia and her face expressed the most decided confidence
i understand nothing of what you are saying
you see madam mits a kind of omen explains fords abruptly and the shamefaced way
nonsense said seraphim alexandrovna
who told you all this asked aha alexander nine in a steer low voice
nos exclaimed seraphim alexandrovna and irritation as though she wished to protect herself somehow from the sudden anxiety
what nonsense as though the lech good could die
she saw clearly that there could be ne possible connection between a child's quite ordinary diversion in the continuation of the child's life
she made a special efforts that evening to occupy her mind with other matters but her thoughts turned involuntarily to the fact that will latch go love to hide herself
when the lunch who was still quite small and had learned to distinguished between her mother in her nurse she sometimes sitting in her nurse's arms made a sudden rugg hish grimace and hid her laughing face and the nurse's shoulder
then she would look out with a sly glance
though she reproached herself at once for this unsound superstitious dread nevertheless she could not end her wholeheartedly into the spirit wegg's favorite game and she tried to divert welch's attention to something else
she eagerly complied with their mother's new wishes
seraphim alexandrovna tried desperately to amuse volga
perhaps that seraphim alexandrovna she is not as strongly drawn to the world as other children who attracted by many things
if this is so is it not a signa organic meekness
sophy mal cinna herself began the game once or twice though she played it with a heavy heart
she suffered as though committing an evil deed with full consciousness
it was a sad day for seraphim alexandrovna
her mother covered her with a blue blanket
l much could drew her sweet little hands from under the blanket and stretched them out embrace her mother her mother bent down
she seemed so small and so frail under the blin that that covered her
spa alexandrovna remained standing over luka bed a long while and she cept looking at the lug with tenderness and fear
i'm a mother is it possible that i shouldn't be able to protector she thought as she imagined various ills that might be fallow lack
she prayed long that night but the prayer did not relieve her sadness
several days passed will latch bick cold
the fever came upon her at night
when seraphim alexandrovna awakened by fiducia came to l lunch bun saw her looking so hot so restless and so tormented she instantly recalled the evil omen and a hopeless dispirit of possession of her from the first moments
our doctor was called and everything was done that as usual on such occasions but the inevitable happened
and the lud grew feebler from hour to hour
nothing made her so unhappy as the reiteration of fedosya uttered between sobs she hid herself and hid herself a elect ca
fever was consuming relet ca and there were times when she lost consciousness and spoken iberia
three days pass torturing like a nightmare
spa alexandrovna hid her face behind the curtains near le luck's bed how tragic
i wait my march g whispered l logic
m much ga white face became blurred and everything grew dark before lola
she met her husband
salina alexandrovna was standing by the coffin and looking dully at her dead child
sama my dear don't agitate yourself said sergeant lu sob in a whisper
you must resign yourself to your fate
she'll be up in a minute persisted ser female alexandrovna her eyes fixed on the dead little girl
sir game loa spoor looked round him cautiously he was afraid of the unseemly and of the ridiculous
see my don't agitate yourself he repeated
he was confused and annoyed
her face seemed tranquil and her eyes were dry
she went into the nursery and began to walk brown the room looking into those places where luka used to hide herself
she walked all about the room and then now and ban to look under the table under the bed in captain repeating cheerfully where's my little one where is my lock
after she had walked round the room once she began to make her questing you
fedosya motionless with dejected face sat in a corner and looked frightened at her mistress when she suddenly burst out sobbing and she wailed loudly
she hid herself and hid herself are the latch guy at angelic little soul
when she entered the parlour there was several people between her in lola
there was an oppressive feeling of heaviness and seraphim alexandrovna's had as she approached lucca
we'll watch go lay there still i pale and smiled pathetically
the little one did not reply
seraph ina alexandrovna stood up erect sighed in a lost way smiled and called loudly but let ga
wei much goes being carried out
captain bull the commander of a small garrison at sab permitted him to land but when the governor began to read his commission full ordered him to be silent
what has happened mister prince was worth asked for he could see that the man was greatly excited governor andrews h come again guessed mister prince why should that alarm us the fellow though get into boasting is not dangerous or liable to put his threats into execution but he h grown dangerous declared mister prince the liberties of the coloni or involved
captain wadsworth became a little uneasy though he was still inclined to treat the matter lightly
we have sternly refused to yield our char involuntarily for it is the guardian of our political rights
that is true cup and wadsworth continued mister prince and to subdue our stubbornness this foy has come to hartford with sixty armed men to demand the surrender of the charter in person
captain wareth founded to his feet in a rage and placing his hand on the hilt of his sword declared he shall not have it
the day was well nice spent when he arrives and the members were engaged in a heated debate on a subject of the utmost importance
he consented however to await the discussion but as soon it was ended he declared that he would have the charter
after that captain had taken two or three turns across the room he paused and asked
what is the assembly doing engaged in debate
and will he wait until it ascended he has promised to do so
mister prince fix's amazed eyes on the captain's face and read their desperate determination captain heat again
mister prince bowed and hastily returned to the house to where the assembly was in session
as soon as he was gone charleses feed and said
yes charles he will answer what do you mean uncle
never did debats take greater interest in a minor subject
what do you intend doing uncle will you fight them
remember the worth must be done right at the time not too soon nor to wait
the sun was setting and the captain said
come charles let us hasten to the assembly
by no means but i want you to be fully interest with a seriousness of your mission
take your please charles and be prepared to do your part with for captain wadsworth
charles god is close to the long capable use by the secretaries is possible without attracting special attention
the discussion went on darkness came and four lighted candles were place on the table in two set on a shelf on the wall
those two candles on the wall were agreed anoints to charles until he saw a man station near them
though the lights were extinguished through the window the faint starlit dimly illuminated the scene
he followed him as rapidly as he could
these was cloth behind him and when they were outsides used his arm
oh i had a care how you approached me
the soldiers began the crowd about the house when at a signal compacting wadsworth the train dance came on the scene and prepared to grapple with the soldiers
where is the charter
you have your soldiers at the door and we have the trainbands of connecticut ready to de find us against violence
who of you has the charter
it was the boy ching range governor
every member of the assembly shook their heads
we do not know him he does not let in america where does he live
little did the captain or as youthful assistant dream that their simple act would make the old tree historic
the tree in which the dolin was hitting was ever afterwards known as charter oak
it remained v gris bearing fruit every year and tittle a little after midnight august eighteen fifty sixth when it was prostrated by heavy storm of wind
when the order from the seizure of the charters was first made known the assembly rylands scent a most loyal ages to the king saying
he formerly dissolved the assembly broke the seal of the colony which bore the figure of an anchor and the word hope admitted five in the inhabitants into his legislated counsel and assumed the function of governor but he did not take away the parchment on which the charter was written
from that time until the fore union of the colonies from mutual defense at the birth out of the friends in indian war the inhabitants of rhode island or their share in the defensive efforts especially when the hostile savages hung along their frenchwoman like an ill omened cloud
the history is that commonwealth is identified with that of all new england from the beginning of king william's war soon after the expulsion of andrews
colbert who had heard his uncle getting ready to run down to the water's edge
it's a schooner said mister bingham to mister minty and she had very heavy cargo
to this cord was fastened a heavy rope or table
what's that board for aspirate as he saw board following the teale
that's the directions said how
they printed in the number of languages and they tell the crew to carry the end of the table high up to the mast and fastened as strongly there
oh i see said berg the lang will stretch then and the breeches wool will go out on a polly
it was clear day nail and much of the wicked storm had passed
with the daylight king girls of women to the beach
missus bobbsey missus minturn nearly and her mother besides dorothy at ma'am were all there flossy and freddy being obliged to say home with dinah susan
of course the girls asked all sorts of questions and burton how tried to answer them as best they could
it seemed a long time before any movement of the cable showed that the buy was returning
nearer and near i came until now a man's head could be seen
the girls and woman were too frightened to talk and nelly clung close to her mother
a big roller dashing even finished the work for the lice birds and a man in the coarse felt banded upon shore
everybody gathered around and knowing with a strange face and a stranger hope broke through the crowd to see the rescued man
oh it is my father she screamed falling right into the ears of the drenched man
but the half drew man rubbed his eyes as if he should not believe them then the next minute he pressed his little daughter to his heart unable to speak a word
and as george bring out there anxiously asked the brother
safe and well came the welcome answer
i guess our prayers were heard last night
shere come another man exclaimed the people as this time a big manon dashed on sands
while i declare we did land on a friendly shore
just as mister bingham said though lie saving work turned out to be a social affair for there was a great time greeting nell's father and how's uncle
and how on his father too put in then
what a morning that was it sunset beach
i'm so glad we pray said little flossy to freddy when she heard the gid names
a beautiful day had grown out of the dreadful storm
and everybody was so happy
the neptune the vessel that had struck on the sand fire was now safely anchored near shore and the sailors came in and out in rowboats back and forth to land just as they wished
then we had to go back to work at the logs went on the captain and then one of our crew took a fever
that was what selina so
finally we had every wall glowed on the schooner and we started off
we canted on getting home less week when this last storm struck us and droll us out of our corse
about the value asked mister bobbsey who was down ted the city
the value repeated the captain aside so that the strangers might not hear
while i'm a rich man now and so is my mate mc roclin for that would was contracted for by largest and richest piano firm in this country and now it is all but delivered to them and the money in our hands
yes indeed it would have taken us a lifetime to a king way with much money as we have earned in this yer
maybe aunt emily will take ye down to the city on her shopping tow suggested nan
he made the clerk to move all the trucks from the isles and i guessed everybody was glad the army fell down
the wonderful fresh air that these men lived in night and day had brightened their eyes too so that even the plainest faced and the most awkward man among them was as nimble as an athlete from his perfect exercise
i don't know how to say good bye you know he told dorothy and n next morning
oh that will be splendid declared nan
youre quite rich now aren't you remarked dorothy
and dorothy went up and down the room wipe the pictures of cinderella's proud sisters
we will be on hand thank you replied the joking dorothy
come nellie called missus blockin i'm ready where's your hat
we might be able to manage that too nelly told him
my uncle is a fireman and he can take us through his engine house
most of them my guess answered berg
well we have had a good vacation and i'm willing to go to work again
so am i declared n vacation was just longin that i think
mister bobbsey was down from the city of course to take the family home and now all hands even freddy and flossy were busy packing up
there were the shells to be looked after the fish nets besides downy the duck and smote the cat
and so o little friends had spent all their vacation
his characters get john cog mad with jealousy or fall an epic fits all rave hysterically
if dust sky had had less vision he would have been stringer
like them he is an novelist of torture
certain with the last of cruelty the lusted destruction the destruction's sake is the most conspicuous of the deadly sins in dust skies men and women
he may not be a cruel author
but d are ever in balance they are always in demoniacal conflict
even the last is never hardly ever the lust of a more or less same man
duster sky could not have described the soon of nekhludoff in resurrection
this is a madhouse cries someone in theories
one resulted this is a mop city of action
even the talk is all actions more than ideas
he saws violent deeds not with the hand but with the suck
but one had noticed during this last two days that the other was wearing a silver watch on a yellow bead chain which he seems not to have seen on before
he took a knife and when his friend had turned away he approached him cautiously from behind took aim turned his eyes heavenwards crossed himself and praying fervently gods forgive mee for crass sake
he never paints every man he always projects austere ski or a night marora hev sky
that is why climbing punishment belongs to a lower range of fiction than ane carnea or fathers and sums
we sympathize indeed with the fears the bravado the despair that succeeded the crime
he is a grotesque made alive by sheer imaginative intensity in passion
one does not grudge an artist and abnormal character or two
he invent vicious grates a dickens events comic greatest
was very fond of hanging cuts and burying them with great ceremony
as for the karamazovs themselves he betrays the old father and the oldest of his sons hating each other in fighting like brutal maniacs
serve him right shouted mitre breathlessly
if i haven't killed him i'll come again and kill him
he is easy to see why dusty qui has become a popular author
no melodramatic ever poured out incident upon the stage from such a horn of plenty
desks always ready to show them all in at once
on two opposite pages of the idiot one finds the following characters brought in by name general a puncheon prince s add lida ivanovna elizabetta procopius yo genie pablo rich redon ski princess bolkonski a glare prince miskin coiled vulgar ippolit valuer ferdy canker nari philipovna nina alexandrovna guna titan and general ev gan
but the secret of duster skis appeal is something more than the multitude in thrill of his incidents and characters
mister murry bald did faces of difficulty and attempts to definition
to him dusk hiss work is the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life it is more than a record of a struggle it is the struggle itself
and those voices take shape in certain unforgetable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly in the in tavern certain surrounding darkness
ultimately they are the creations not of a man who desired to be but of a spirit which sought to know
because they have possessed they are no longer men and women
this is all in a masion true
to say this is not to deny the spiritual content of dusts work the anguish of the imprisoned souls at battles with doubt and denial and despair
there is in dostoevsky a suggestion of caliban trying to discover some better god than sir tables
the ultimate attitude of duster ski is as christian as the apostle peters lord believe helped down minnie
and beyond the dark night of suffering and dissipating the night gusts is still seized a light of christian compassion
or even by the compassion of others like prince miskin in the idiot
his work like his face bears the mark of this terrible conflict
the novels of the perfect image of the man
as to the man himself the vicomte deal gay described him as he saw him in the last years of his life
when he became excited on a certain points one could have sworn that one had seen him before see to i bent in a police court awaiting trial or among vagabonds who passed their time begging before the prison doors
at all other times he carried that look of sad and gentle meekness seen on the images of old stiva saints
that the portrait of the men one sees behind oust sky's novels the portrait one might almost have inferred from the novels
it is a figure that it once fascinates and repels
he is not by temperament to singer
his music is a still small west unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and storm
truth to tell mister hardy is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet
he does not express life easily in beautiful words or in images
thus he writ in i found her out there of one who
there could not be an ugly and more prosaic saturation there contained in the aria in the last line
and prosing juries in the choice of words as well as in images
take for example the use of the word domiciled in the passage in the same palm about
when we is strangers sought their catering care veiled smiles bespoke their thought of what we were
catering care is an appalling phrase
is a line of good poetry
you did not come and marching time drew on and warm me numb yet lost for loss of your dear presence there then that i thus found lacking in your make that higher compassion which can overbear reluctance for pure loving kindness sake grieve die when is the hob stroked it some you did not come
there are hints of the grand style of lyric poetry in these lines but fraser's lurk in your make and as the hope hour stroked it some a discords the bread tumbling to the levels of victorian commonplace
he has a temperament sensitive beyond that of all but a few recent writers to the pain and passion of human beings
one can remember palm after poem of his with a theme that might easily have serves for mister hardy too late christina the lost mistress the last ride together the statue and the bust to name a few
but what a sense of child there is in brownings tragedy
his world is a place of opulence not a poverty
to have loved in for an hour is with browning to live forever after in the inheritance of a mighty achievement
to have loved for an hour is in mister hardy's imagination to have deepened the sadness even more than the beauty of one's memories
for then i u distressed by hearts growing cold to me could lonely wait my end was rest me equanimity
but time to make me grieve part steals lets part abide and shakes this fragile frame and eves with throbbings of me tide
and despair is by no means triumphant in what is perhaps the most attractive of all mister hardy's palms the oxen
you pictured the meek mild creatures where they dwelt in this jury pen nor did it occur to one of us there to doubt over kneeling then
the murder faith however or rather of delight in the memory of feet is not mister hardy's prevailing mood
he can enter upon a wall without ironic good darts as we see in the song men who marched away
how long he cries in a poem written some years ago
when shall the senor softer polonias where of we dream have sway in each proud land and patriotism grown god lack scorner stand bon slave to realms but circle earth and seeds
but perhaps his characteristic attitude to wars to be found not in lines like these but in that melancholy poem the souls of the slain in which the souls of the dead soldiers returned to their country in question a senior sol flame was to how their friends and realities have kept their doughty deeds in remembrance
and general hell hold out her sweethearts sworn royal as doves
some fickle and fleet hearts have found the new loves
and our wives quit another resignedly do they on our deeds
mister hardy has tree bitter a sensible reality to believe much in the glory of war
the whewell to mister hardy is the world of ancient human things in which war has come to be a hideous irrelevance
it may be thought on the other hand that mister hardy's polls about war are no more expressive of tragic futility than his pals about love
futility in frustration are ever requiring seems in both
his lovers luc his soldiers wrote in the grey defeated of their glory
lovers are always severed both in life and in death
in beyond the last lamp we have the same mournful cry over severance
no shade of pinnacle or tree or tower while earth in jaws will fall in my mound and within the hour still unto yours one wilder never haunt are too green coverts
bring as face to face with an experienced intenser that ow

when a lope was surprised as much as the tender sisterly hur could wished when doris flashed out upon her thon fly and the evening on the party with the plack skirt nicely press and we hung and the prettiest waist imaginable a waste that was a positive creation of dainty rose prickled silk with a girdle and knots of black velvet
so peer lope went to blinds party and her dress was the admiration of every gunter
when lope her altogether charming
she looks us if she had just stepped out of the frame of some lovely old picture she s to herself
my old adela gave me give us there material she stammered
i'm named after her missus fail weather suddenly put her arm about penelope and ruth the young girl to her her lovely old face aglow with delight and tenderness
then you are my ground knees she said
when i saw your trice i felt sure you were relighted to her i should recognize that rose b seal if i came across it in tibet
p elope was four years alt than i was but we were devoted to each other
soon after these our mother died and our house called was broken up
my dear i'm a very lonely old woman with no body belonging to me
now she pattered missus fire weathers soft old hand affectionately
doris and penelope found their leaves and plants changed in the twin cling of ana
where missus farewel had gone dor is't panny be looked at each other
as she slaved into her blue brained afternoon tics her aunt called to her frown billow
a jane was standing at the fold of the stairs with a lamping one hand and the year old baby clanging to the other
she was a big shapeless woman with a round good natured face cheerful and father as sunflower was a jane at all times and occasions
i want to run over and see how missus biggs big a this evening city and you must take care of the babby till i get back
sin m sighed and went aster for the baby
all her days were alike as far ass hard work and dullness went but she accepted them cheer frey and un complainingly
but she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter
the room was more and their box about the kitchen which sidney shar with two small cousins

just at that particular angle one eye appeared to be as large as an orange while the other was the size of ap and the month z exacted from ear to ear

they had not much to say as they knew that they were in forth
and by this act preceded our souls as well
for whether in that state men would have been master of a man
therefore in the state of innocence man had no mastership of the animals
therefore in the state of innocence before men had it spade nothing dispatch to him
secondly disapproved by the other of divine providence which h was governs in parian by the superior
certainly this is proved from a property man and bother animals
now whatever part is pated is subject to what is essential and universal
therefore a subjection of other animals to man is proke to be natural
they would now hither on this come had been accepted from the mastership of men as neither at pressed nor d for their reason accepted from the mastership of god who providence has ordain others
this is signified by the fact that god let they animals to men that he might gave the names expressive that their respected natures
so all animals would have a bit men of their own court as in the present day some domestic animals obeying
objection one it will seemed that inn savin since men would not have had mastership over all other creatures
much last therefore would have a bed man in the state of the nance
therefore since it is by this reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems fettering the stately sense man had been in over plans
now in m reason has the position of the master and not of a subject
i answer that we must need admit that in a primitive state there would have been some ane quality at least as regard sex because generation depends upon digressive sex and likewise as regards age for some would have been born of others nor would sect a union have been sterile
there might also have been bodily disparity
the clarity myles a rise on the parts of nature as bove described without any defects nature
objection one he will sein that in the dii since men would not hay ms overmen
therefore in the state of innocence now not have been subject to man
in other sense mastership is referred him a general sends to ancona of subject and in this sense even pay has the office of governing and directing freemen can be cut master
such a kind of mastership would have existed in the status between man and med for two reasons
but in the state of innocence they would have been lowe ness age
on the contrary everything generated expressing perfect but in the sate of innocence children ha been begot by generation
therefore from the first they would happen in perfect in boding size and power
therefore in the state of innocence there was no need for women to be borne on the contrary natures process in generation happy incontestably wished by god
i have been told that mister van brandt is i prison for debt i said
and i saw for myself last night that he had left you hopeless
he left me the little money he had with him when he was arrested she rejoined sadly
his cruel creditors and more to blend th he is for the poverty that has fallen on us
even this negative defensive ane brandt stung me to the quick i ought to have spoken more guardedly of him i said bitterly
i ought to have remembered that a woman can forgive almost any wrong than a man can inflict on her when he is a man whom she loves
she put her hand on my mouth and stop me before i could say any more
how can you speak so cruelly to me she asked
you know to my shame i confess it to you the last time we met ye know that my heart in secret is all yours
what wrong are you talking of
is it the wrong i suffered when dan brant married meat with a wife living at the time and living still
do you think i can ever forget the great misfortune of my life the misfortune that has made me unworthy of you
it is no fault of mine god knows but it is not the less true that i am not married and that the little darling who is playing out there with her doll as my child
and you talk of my being your wife knowing that the child accepts me as her second father i said
it would be better and happier for us both if you had as little pride as a child pry she repeated
in such a position as mine
a helpless woman with a mock husband in prison for debt
am i to marry you for my food and shelter
im i to marry you because there is no lawful tie that binds me to the father of my child
that is he is he is not forsaken me he has been forced away
my only friend is it possible that you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife
the woman in my situation must be heartless indeed who could destroy your place in estimation of the world in the regard of your friends
though wretchedest creature about walks the streets would shrink from treating you in that way
o what are men made of
how can you how can you speak of it
i yielded and spoke of it no more
every word she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom i had loved and lost
bitterly as i hated the man who had parted us i loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake hopeless infatuation
i don't deny it i don't excuse it hopeless infatuation you have forgiven me i said
let me deserve to be forgiven
it is something to be your only friend
you must have plans for the future tell me unreservedly how i can help you
complete the good work that you have the gun she answered gratefully help me back to health
make me strong enough to submit to a doctor's estimate of my chance of living for some years yet
a doctor's estimate of your chances of living i repeated what do you mean
i hardly know how to tell you she said without speaking again of mister van brandt
the speaking of him again speaking of his depths i asked
why read you hesitate
you know that there is nothing i will not do to relieve your anxiety
never let me tell you the plain truth
there is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison
yes this is his position in two words a little while sense he obtained an excellent offer a employment abroad from a rich relative of his and he had made all his arrangements to accept it
unhappily he returned to tell me of his good fortune and the same day he was arrested for depth

thinks to the happy acid of my position though one certain way of protecting her lay easily within my reach
i could offer to lend the scoundrel the money that he wanted at an hour's notice and he was an man to accept my proposal quite as easily as i could make it
you are quite mistaken i replied
i am only doubting whether your plan for relieving mister van brant of his embarrassments is quite so simple as he suppose
are you aware as they delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to borrow money and apology of insurance
i know nothing about it she said sadly
will you let me ask advice said my lawyers
they are trust where the unexperienced men and i am sure they can be use to you
cautiously as i had expressed myself her delicacy took the alarm
promise that you won't ask me to borrow money of you for mister van branch she rejoined and i will acceptor help gratefully
i could honestly promise that
my one chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge to course that i had now determined to pursue
i rose to go while my resolution still sustained me
kiss me she whispered before you go
it is only your goodness that overpowers me
the next day everybody the house began to make preparations with the journey

the days glided by with the stiffness and crisped ms growing thus painful and the pony recovering fast for the clear mountaineer seemed to act like a cure for wounds
every day that came showed the injured animal and better condition
as efforts to move the longer made christ wins and forget his own pains in those he fell at seeing the must suffer
everyone as busy for the keeping watch regularly took up a good deal of time

i'm afraid father will say that the ponies ought to be close at hand

well you must talk it a rue father said chris
too many redskins about as i told you
they always too many red skins about cried chris impatiently
i wish you could charge them boldly ascend him flying over the plains
never to come back again said med sharply
not quite my lads don't you see that were plaining of every ticklish game
just then the doctor came into the shelter with a boys having talking bring with them won lovely shooting or rather trying to shoot for hee had had no success and they two were talking earnestly about ways ames
ill hear the your briggs c the doctor

the indians have shipped the quarters and there ina bal us ewer a position as we could contrives our purpose
we must get aways on him to some good hunting ground
to the indian seem to be camping or only on the moves
this seemed to me to be hatching up some dodger another replied books
then he began to walk up and down slowly evidently deepen thought
there he said as made of my mind
it is very evident that we may wait here turned stores exhausted and be as far off the opportunity we seek his er
the indians can wait mee cannot and they seems to know it
going to give up young chris's pin said brigs below

the jack hated craggs so shabbily that the boy started sem right if they did sir
what business have they to want our sculp what we should have shed them up his five
they'd have weeks of work before they could get their horses out but without horses they'd be out in awake
starve nonsense
but there i don't want to make speeches it's our settle gentleman
well you've got to tell the lookout with coming off
now everyone understand that he is to be ready without showing any wasatch foot in din scout that there is something on the way
and again when the artists following malicorne advice a little late in arriving and when saint agnan had been obliged to be absent for some time it was interesting to observe though no one witnessed them those moments of silence full of deep expression which united in one side to souls most disposed to understand each other and who by no means objected to the quite meditation enjoyed together
in a word malicorne philosopher that he was though he knew it not had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in amidst of play and with desire in the assurance of possession
in this manner therefore without leaving her room and having no confidant she was able to return to her apartment thus removing by her appearance a little tardy perhaps the suspicions of the most determined sceptic
but the door remained close and neither sin agnan nor the painter a peered nor did the hangs e move
goot u dearest love said the king the to return quickly
no no not today sire
i knew but too well that you had not ceased to love me
the valori with a gesture partly of extreme terror and partly as if invoking a blessing attempted to speak but cannot articulate one word
at the moment however when the king threw himself on his knees a a cry of utter despair rank through the corridor accompanied by the sound of retreating footsteps
the captain sitting buried in his leather armchair his spurs fixed in the floor his sword between his legs was reading a number of letters as he twist his moustache
d'artagnan uttered a welcome full of pleasure when he perceived his friend's son
we my boy he said by what a lucky incident does it happened that the king has recalled you
these words d not sound agreeably in the young man's ears who as he seated himself replying upon my word i cannot tell you all that i knows i have come back hum
that the king has not recalled you and you have returned
i did' understand that at all
raoul was already pale enough and he now began to turn his hat round and round in his hand
what they dose is the matters that you look as you do and what makes you so dumb
said the captain do people nowadays assume that sort of airs in england
i have been in england and came here again as lively as a chaffing
but you not say something
i have too much to say
ah how is your father
forgive me my dear friend i was going to excuse that
d'artagnan increased his sharpness of his penetrating gaze which no secret was capable resisting
you are unhappy about something he said
i am indeed and you know the reason very well monsieur d'artagnan
nay do not pretend to the astounds
i am not pretending to be astonished my fr
i have neither head noor arm do not despise but help me in t words i in the most wretched of living beings oh
she is deceiving ill said d'artagnan not a muscle of whose face had moved those are big words wh makes use of them
everyone ah
if everyone says so there must be some truth in it
not for a friend for a son
i do take it you are really l from curiosity
no it is not from curiosity is is from love
cut another big word
i tell you i love louise to distraction
well suppose it were only that
no sensible man ever succeeded in making much have a brain when the head was turned
i have completely lost my senses in the same way o hundred times in my life
you would hear but you would not understand me you would understand but you would not obey me
oh try tie
i go far even if i were unfortunate enough to know something and foolish enough to communicate it to you you are my friend you say indeed yes
very good i should quarrel with you
i never complain as you know but as heaven my father would never forgive me for blowing out my brain i will go and get the first person i meet to give me the information which you withhold i will tell him he lies and and you a killum
and a fine affair that would be so much the better what should i care
you now assume a different home instead of killing you will get killed yourself i suppose you mean very fine indeed
how much i should regret you
of course i shall go about all day saying oh
what a fine stupid fellow that brag alone was
as great as stupid as i ever met with
go them gan go and get yourself disposed of if you like
i hardly know who can have touch you logic but do take me if your father has not been regularly robbed of his money
where will buried it faced in his hands murmuring no no i have not a single friend me world
i don't fancies monsieur i do not laugh at you though i am a gascon
a carp what do you mean
upon my word i d not know someone told me there was a carpenter who made an opening through a certain floor
why don't knowe where
and whose room m
i have told you for the last hour that i know nothing of the whole affair
but the painter then de portrait
why you see to him only that name in your mouth
i do that suppose it will concern him
yes you're right and he made a step or two as if he were going to leap wh are you going
to loo for summon who attend me bee truth
who is that a woman
you wish to be consoled by someone and you will be so at once she will tell you nothing ill herself of course so be off
you are mistaken monsieur replied raoul the oman i mean will tell me all the evil she possibly can
well i admit it
and in point the fact why should i play with you as a cat does with the poor mouth
you distress me you do indeed
wait if you can
i could not so much due worse
i said raoul snatching eagerly at the pen which the captain held out him
how very fortunate that is he was looking for you too
she said the same tone of voice it is not i who am going to speak to him oh then
