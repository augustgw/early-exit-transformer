as i approached a city i heard bells ringing and little later i found the street to stir with throngs of well dressed people in family groups winding their way hither and thither
looking about me i saw a gentleman in a neat black dress smiling and his hand extended to me with great cordiality
he must have realized i was a stranger and wished he tendered his hospitality to me i accepted it gratefully i clasped his hand he pressed on
we gazed for a moment slightly into each other's eyes
of course you are going there too i said to my friendly guide
yes he answered i conduct the worship i am a priest
an idol i whispered taken by surprise
they worshipped god they did not exist
but the greeks loved their gods i protested my heart clamor my breast
no i said in a low voice
he was an idol then and not a god
it made athens see of light it created the beautiful the true the good yes our religion was divine
it had only one fault interrupted my guide what was that
i inquired without knowing what his aunts would be it was not true
produce him
i wish me to myself what blast for me
then taking heart i told my guide how more than once i had felt apollo's grading at presence in my heart and told him of the immortal lines of homer concerned the dvina hollo
do you doubt homer
i said to him homer the inspired bard
no no apollo is not an idle
he is a god and a son of a god
the air was heavy with incense a number of men in gorgeous vestments were passing to and fro now in a kneeling before the various lights and images
observing my anxiety to understand the mean of all this my guide took me aside and in a whisper told me that a people were celebrating the anniversary of the birth the other beautiful savior jesus the son of god
forget apollo he said with his digestion of severity his voice
there is no such person he was only an idol
if he would assert for apollo in all the universe would never find e one answering to his name or description
i won't de see jesus i hasten turning toward him
will he not be here this morning
will he not speak to his worshippers i asked again
will he not permit them to touch him to caress his hand to class with divine feet to in held the ambrosial fragrance of his breath to bask in the golden light of his eyes to hear the music of his immaculate accents
i asked my eyes feel with wondering my voice quivering with excitement
would not that then i venture to ask impatiently make ease as much of an idol as apollo
and if faith that jesus is a god pros him of god why will not faith in apollo make him a god
but i am determined not only to know if it is possible the whole truth about jesus but also to communicate that truth through others
but there is more of a moral tonic in the open and candid discussion of a subject like the one hand than in the multitude of platitudes
i never to live her lecture in which i do not either directly or indirectly give full and free expression to my faith in everything that is worthy of faith

as intelligent beings would desire to know where this jesus whose works was not only costing the world millions of the people's money but which is also drawing to his service a time the energies the affections the devotions and the labor humanity is a myth or reality
a number of other dates were observed with a christian church of various times as the birthday of jesus the goss was give no date and appeared to be quite uncertain really ignorant about it
yet there is no evidence that he was born on that day
why this discreet see an historical document to say nothing about inspiration

who was matthew who was mark
who were john peter judas and merry
there is absolutely no evidence that they ever existed
if peter ever went to rome with the new doctrine hows it that no historian has taken note of him
here again we see the presence of a myth
he was the only one who saw them
peter paul john james judas i'll keep out the stage almost exclusively
it is impossible to explain why the contemporaries of jesus the authors and the historians of this time do not take notice of him
could they have been a conspiracy against him
how is his unanimous sides be account for
how then are we to decide which the numerous candidates for divine honors should be human our votes
and such a faith is never free it is always maintained but a sword now and by hell far hereafter
yet the most impossible utterances are put in juice mouth
only a mythical jesus could virtually hand over the government levers to corners who have petitions to press upon his attention
moreover if jesus could keep his promise there would be today no misery in the world no orphans no childless mothers no shipwrecks no floods no famines no disease no crippled children no insanity no wars no crime no wrong

the gas manager did not like art light but interfered only with his street service which r not his largest source of income by enemies

mister hale sipped his tea now traced silence margaret had the responses all to herself
she forgot that he had not made them an offer
margaret was repairing her mother's worsted work and rile the shrinking from the thought of the long evening and wishing bedtime would come that she might go over the events of the day again
margaret

mister lennox had never had the opportunity of having any points conversation with a father after her refusal or else that would indeed a very serious affair
but she soon felt it was not about anything which having only lately and suddenly occurred could have given rise to any complicated thoughts and her father wished to speak to her
mister hale did not answer for a mere d'oro
margaret could not bear the sight of the suspense which was even more distressing to her father than to herself
but why dear papa do tell me
because i must no longer be a minister in the church of england

margaret i will tell you about it
i will answer any questions this once but after tonight let user the speak of it again
i can need the consequences of my painful miserable doubts but it is an effort beyond me to speak of what has calls me s with suffering
no not doubts as to religion nor the slightest injury to that he paused
margaret's sighed as if standing on the rage of summing horror
margaret how in loved the holy church from return to be shut out
he could not go on for a long and jotted
margaret could not tell what to say i seemed to her as terribly mysterious as if her father were about do him mahometan

as he read this and glance much more which he did not read he gained resolution for himself and felt as if he too could be brave and firm in doing what he believed to be right but as he ceased he heard margaret's low convulsive sob and his courage sang down under the keen sense of suffering
i have borne long with sou reproach they would have roused any min less tor bid and cowardly than mine
he shook his head as he went on
margaret i cried to do it i cried to content myself as simply refusing their additional prevalent and stopping quietly here stranding my conscience now as i had strained it before
god forgive me
he rose and walked up and down the room speaking no words of self reproach and humiliation of which margaret was thankful to hear but a few
margaret i return to the all said burden we must leave helstone

margaret did dislike it dicing from it more than from anything she had ever had to do in her life before
mister hale shook his head despondingly he pressed her hand in token of beatitude
margaret was nearly upset again into a burst of crime
to durn her thoughts she said now tell me papa what up nana
you and mamma have some money independent of the income from the living have not you aunt shaw has i know
seventy of that has always gone to frederick since he has been abroad

margaret was all the stand

she felt that sonya was speaking the truth that there was such love as sonya was speaking of
she believed it could be but did not understand it

now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of herself and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had taken on himself

the countess had been prepared by an mihalovna's heads at dinner
on retiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes fixed on her miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuff box while the tears kept coming into her eyes
the coats pretty ear to the keyhole and listened
at first he heard a sound of indifferent voices then ann mihalovna's voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silence then both voices together with glad intonations and then fruit steps
an mihalovna opened the door
when she heard this sonya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and unable to be the loops turned upon her ran away into the dancing hall were old rounded at phil speeded with her dress puffed out like a balloon and flushed and smiling plumped down on the floor
the comtesse was cry

the pablo of grants held feast after feast celebrating a wars they had received for the campaign and made expeditions to all moods to visit a certain cow line the hungarian who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls waitresses
the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading their cleanliness and discipline
the regiments had entered and left the tone with their bands playing and by the grands orders the men had marched all the wheat in step a practice on which the guards prided themselves the officers on fuit and at their proper pulse
boris had been coarser and had marched all the way with berg who was already in combine of a company
boris during the campaign had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become acquainted with prince andrew bolkonski though whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in chief stuff
berg and boris humming rested after yesterday's march were sitting clean and neatly dressed at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them plain chess
well how are you going to get out of that he remarked
at that moment door opened
dear me how you have changed
he was about to embrace his friends but nicholas avoided her
he wanted to pinch him push him do anything but kiss him a think everybody did
but notwithstanding their spore us embraced him in a quiet friendly we and kissed him three times
they had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when young ment in their first steps on lych roads each saw immense changes in the other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken was fir steps
i did not expect you to be he added
you know of course that his imperial highness wrote with our regiment all the time so that we in every comfort and every advantage
what receptions we had i polands
what dinners and balls i can't tell you
o you guard said rostov i say surface a wine
he went to his bed drew a part him under the clean pillow and sent for wine
yes and i have some money in o letters to give you he added
i'll don't mention it coes i quite understand said burg getting up and speaking in a muffled in guttural voice
gore cross turks they invited you added boris
berg p on the keenest of courts without a spot or speck of dust stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and having insured himself from the way rostov looked at it that his court had been noticed left the room with a pleasant smile
oh dear what a beast i am muttered rostov as he read a letter why
well have you sent gabriel for so white all right lights half some
in the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to biggs which the old countess at anna miko's advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to take it to its destination and make use of it
why have you thrown that away asked boris
is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want it for
he looked intently un inquiringly into his friend's eyes evidently trying in ving to find the answer to some question
which you believe it coat i was not at all alarmed cause i knew i was right
i came forward berg stood up and showed how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self complacency than his did
well he stoned at me as the saying is stormed and stormed and stormed
it was not a matter of life but rather of death as the same is
albanian and devils and two siberia said berg with a sagacious smile
still i remain silent what do you think coat
the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day
that's the weak coat said berg lighting his pipe and emitting lings of smoke
yes i was fainted rostov smiling
rostov with a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie
he began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened that imperceptibly involuntarily and inevitably he elapsed into falsehood
prince andrew who liked to help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed towards boris who had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what the young man wanted
the spate of prince andrew's disagreeable ironical ton in spite of the contemn with which rostov from his fighting army point of view regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one rostov fell confused blushed and became silent
ors inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without indiscretion one may ask about our plans
we shall probably advance replied bolkonski evidently reluctant to see more in the presence of a stranger
burnt at the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as which remote the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled
i was stir said rostov angry as if intending to insult eight de camp
with a slightly contemptuous smile he said yes that i many stories now told them at that afar
but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy's fire
our stories have some wheat not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get re wars without doing anything
however he added rising you now my name and were to find me we don't forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted and as a man order than you my advice is to let the matter drop
exclaimed prince andrews and was boat to them both he went out
and he was still more angry at having omitted to see it
he ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave a boers rode home
should he go to headquarters next and challenge that a fated adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that wig him all the we

to speak the truth he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small book debts of this stamp which notwithstanding eugenius as frequent advice he too much disregarded thinking that as not one of them was contracted through any malignity but on the contrary from an honesty of mind and the mare city of humor they would all of them be crossed out in cause
eugenius would never admit this and would often tell him that one day or rosse he would certainly be reckoned with and he would often add in an accent of sorrowful apprehension to his uttermost bight
what inclined eugenius to the same opinion was as follows
yorick followed eugenius was his eyes to the door his own closed to them and never opened them more
alas po yorick

and after midday they beheld an unshaped little man upon a horse and after him a day more damsel also on horseback and after her a knight of large stature bowed down and hanging his head low and sorrowfully and clad in broken and worthless armour

thus will it be best to do said arthur let this man have medical care until it be known whether he may live
to grover in her handmaid and said he
in the steward of the household so ordered her
and being young he changed himself and grew to hate the sin that seemed so like his own of moderate arthur's nephew and fell at last in the great battle fighting for the king
and when drane came to the place where whenever was he saluted her
then they went in and dismounted
heaven protect thee said arthur and the welcome of heaven be unto thee
and inasmuch as thou hast vanquished edna and the son of nod thou hast had a prosperous career
and from that time she became his wife
and the maiden took up her about in the palace and she had many companions both men and women and there was no maiden more esteemed than she in the island of britain
and a year and a second and a third he proceeded thus until his fame had flown over the face of the kingdom
and he greets thee well as an uncle should greet his nephew and as a vassal should greet his lord
and the neighboring chiefs knowing this grow insolent toward him and covered his land in possessions
and arthur told you ain't the cause of the mission and of the coming of the ambassadors to him out of con wall truly said jerrine be it to my advantage your disadvantage lord i will do according to thy will concerning the embassy

and everyone asked that which he desired
and they were not long in giving so eager was everyone to bestow gifts and of those who came to ask his none departed unsatisfied
then drains and embassies to the men of cornwall to ask themis
and they all said that it would be the fullness of joy and honor to them for drane to come and receive their homage
so he received the homage of such as were there
and the day after the follows of other intended to go away

and the tis she said in the word she had spoken awoke him
and evil betide me said he if thou returnest here until thou knowest whether i have lost my strength so completely as thou didst say
then drane went to see urban
sir said he i am going upon a quest and i am not certain when i may come back

but one person only will gard me
and he desired enid to mount her horse and to ride forward and to keep a long way before him
and unless i speak unto thee say not thou one word either
and though thou shouldst desire to see my defeat in my death by the hands of those men yet do i feel no dread
and he received him and that not feebly
and say not one word unto me unless i speak first unto thee
i will do as far as i can lord said she according to die desire
i made said he it is vain to a temper seating forward
i cannot by any means refrain from sleep through weariness said he do thou therefore wash the horses and sleep not
and when she saw the dawn of day appear she looked around her to see if he were waking and thereupon he woke
and they left the wood and they came to an open country with meadows on one hand and mo was mowing the meadows
my lord he added will be displeasing to bee if i ask whence thou comest also
wilt thou foul my counsel said the you can take thy meal from me
what sort of meal he inquired
then they washed and took their repast
i go now lord said he to meet the night and to conduct him to his lodging
i will do lord said she as thou sayest
and after they had eaten and drank drane went to sleep and so did een it also
the date seem une point but thrill the period the offices and men of the ship have been unremittingly busy
bows attacked the ship's stores surveyed re list and re stowed them saving very much space by un stowing numerous cases and stowing the contents in the lazarette
without steam the lek can now be kept under with the hand pump by two daily efforts of a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes
as the ship was and in her present heavily lid in condition would certainly have taken three to four hours each day
the large green tent was put up and prop supports made for it
the er room staff and antics people on the engines scientist was stowing their laboratory the cook refitting as galley and sew not a single spot but had its band of workers
the m space such as is therefore extends from the fore hatch the stem on the main deck
under the forecastle of stalls of fifteen ponies the maximum space would hold the narrow irregular space in front is packed tight with fodder
neatly behind the forecastle bol cad is a small booby hatch the only interest to the men's mastic and bad weather
about the fore hatches the ace house
we manage to get three tons of ice one hundred sixty two caucasus of mutton and three cockades of beef beside some boxes of sweetbreads and kidneys into this space
the sacs containing this last added to the goods already mentioned make a really heavy deck cargo and one is naturally anxious concerning it but everything that can be done by lashing and securing has been done
forage i originally ordered thirty tons of compressed oaten hay from melbourne
the scene is wholly enchanting in such a view from some sheltered sunny corner in a garden which blazes with masses of red and golden flowers tends to feelings of inexpressible satisfaction with all things
a great mass of people assembled

telegram to say terran ovah had arrived sunday night
a third sledge in across the break of the poop in the space hitherto occupied by the after which
the quantities to in half tons and the space occupied considerable
the ship was over two feet by the stern but this will soon be remedied
they must perforce be chained up and they had given what shelters afforded on deck but their position is not enviable
it is a pathetic attitude deeply significant of cold and misery occasionally some poor beast emits a long pathetic wine
there are generally wanted two on watch which ease matters but it is a squash
later in the day the wind has veal to the westward heading us slightly
oats and atkinson with intermittent assistance or others were busy keeping the ponies on their legs
there was nothing for it but to grapple with the evil and nearly all hands were laboring for hours in the weights of the ship heaving coal sacks overboard and re lashing the petal cases et cetera and the best maner possible under such difficult and dangerous circumstances
no sooner with some semblance of order restored than some exceptionally heavy way would tear away the lashing and the work had to be done all over again
from this moment above four a m the enjoin became the centre of interest
the water gained despite of every effort
the outlook appeared grim
the amount of water which was being made with the ship so roughly handled was most uncertain
williams had to confess he was beaten and must draw fires what was to be done
the built pomp is depended on the main engine
on one occasion i was wast deep on standing on the rail of the proof
the after god were organized in two poddies by evans to work buckets the men were kept steadily going on the choked hand pumps this seemed all that could be done for the moment and what a magic account as the soul safe got of the ship from sinking practically an attempt to bail herr
occasionally a heavy sea would bear one of them away and he was only saved by his chain
the farm had taken this morning nill and now lay crawled up on a bed of moss
whenever the fawn cot up he was quite content to frisk about
the danger was certain now it was near
the howls had struck the twel where she turned and the fawn was see
one was rolling the other had a gun in his hand what should she do
her tired lakes could not propel the tired body rapidly
the gat saw the boat nearing her
in a moment more the boat was on her and the m at the oars had leaned over and cut her
i was tormented my thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctor's orders
that old men ceased to give so much annoyance yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams
pilch i given them orders not to speak to me of this
this maid had stolen from me certain little things of some importance and in her fear being detected she would have been very glad if i had died
accordingly she allowed me twice to take as much as i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask full i then covered myself and began to sweat and fell into a deep sleep
they say that my poor friend was on the point of falling to the ground so great was he to hear this
afterwards he took an ugly state and began to beat the serving girl with all his mind shouting out ahhh traitress you have killed him for me then
she may did have saved my life so led me a helping hand for i have sweated and be quick about it
flure recovered his spirits dried and make me comfortable and i been conscious of a great improvement in my state began to reckon on recovery
just then the other doctor bernardino put in his appearance who at the beginning of my illness had refused to bleed me
my references calls that most able mame exclaimed oh power of nature
she knows what she requires and the physicians know nothing
that simplon mice rubber nard diner made uns say if he had drunk another bottle he would have been cured upon the spot
afterwards he turned to me and asked if i could have drunk more water
i answered no because i had entirely quenched my thirst
in like manner she was asking for what she wanted when the poor young m begged you to bleed him
if you knew that recovery dependent upon his drinking two flasks and water why did you not say so before
you might then have boasted of his kill
at these words the wretched quite sulkily departed and never showed his face again
the very evening i was taken with great precautions in a chair well wrapped up and protected from the cold
do not permit him any irregularities for though he has escaped this time another disorder now would be the death of him
then he turned to me and said my van veneto be prudent commit no excesses and when you are quite recovered i beg you to make me a madonna with your own hand and i will always pay my devotions to it for your sake
so i made my mind up and prepared to travel
that day many friends came to see me among others pierre lady who was the best a dearest friend i ever had
next day there came a certain nicolo d monte auto who was also a very great friend of mine
i had harboured him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house upside down for the man was subject to a species of dry scab which he was always in the habit of scratching with his head
meanwhile that able physician francesco d monte vari attended to my cure with great skill
there they sitt at me to wait until the duke went by
many of my friends at court came up to greet me and expressed surprised that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shattered by illness they said that i ought to have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke
at these words myra augustino the duke's taylor made his way through all those gentlemen and said if that's all you want to know you shall know it at this very moment
george wass a painter whom i have mentioned happened just then to pass and myra augustino exclaimed there is the man who accused you now you know yourself if it be true or not
as fiery as i could not being able to leave my seat i asked georgian if it was true that he had accused me
he denied that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sword
my ro augustino retorted you gallows bird
don't you know that i know it for most certain
georgia made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me
then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted
the duke gazed at me and marveled i was still alive afterwards he bade me take he to be an honest man and regained my health
when i reached home nicolo monte brutus came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin written with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards take french leaf because my jeopardy came from a quarter and a man who was able to destroy me
i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had endured me and told him all the affair about the mint
he repeated get hens as quickly as you can and be of good courage for you will see your vengeance executed sooner than you expect
i the best attention to my health gave pietro bargo advice about stamping the coins and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else
you want them to immortalized that ferocious tyrant
you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you i will inveterate foe and their devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mine to hang you without any fault of yours
it was firmly believed that duke alisandre was the son of pope clement
mister francesco used also to say and swear by all his saints that if he could he would have robbed me of the dies for that meadow
i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more
i now sent to florence to request laurina that he would send me the reverse of the meadow
nicolo d monte geo to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher lawn cy not for it he had replied he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better invent one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bring it without hesitation to the duke for this would be to my advantage
i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate impressed the word forward to my best ability
this being so as he was a fellow of much humour we used often to laugh together about the great credit he had gained
i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling peas ready and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball
i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to heap my mark at two hundred cubits which cannot be done by other ways of loading
i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we made haste for rome
we have succeeded in amassing two hundred ounces of silver enough i trust to erect a handsome bronze figure
to be sure it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priest is boasting about i could live at ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose
but the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrades thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of joanna
here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in ferry boats that start as soon as some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travelers embarked
when the boatmen and passengers heard the splash and saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made every effort to save him but the wind was fair and the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him
when he saw this the room feigned the utmost grief in dismay and said to his fellow passengers this priested whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron and as i happened to have business there as well we settled to travel together
now alas by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone
he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believed a story and pitied and tried to comfort him
then the road and said to the boatman
what thank you gentlemen added he turning to the ugly travellers
day of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their onward journey and all with one voice agreed to what the ran and had proposed and so the matter was settled
when at length they reached the shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the roman overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priest's luggage and putting it with his own pursued his journey to kiote
fortune favoring his speculations he began to amass great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself nothing and in the course of time he married a wife who bore him a child
since then allay gone well with me yet had i not been poor i had never turned assassin nor thief
he would have fled into the house but the ghost stretched forth its withered arm and clutching the back of his necks scaled at him with a vindictive glare and a hideous ghastliness of mean so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear
at length undone by such ceaseless vexation tok bay fell ill and kept muttering o misery misery the wandering priest is coming to torture me
now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest who lodged in the next street
and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all over
three years ago at the cana fery you flung me into the water and well you remember it
happily continued the priest i had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so i reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded in setting up a bronze figure to buddha dust fulfilling the wish of my heart
on my journey homewards i took a lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvelous ailment
thinking i could divine its cause i came to see you and am glad to find i was not mistaken
and would it not ill become me to bear malice
repent therefore an abandon your evil ways
to see you do so i should esteem the height of happiness
be of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that i am really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you
in a fit of madness i was tempted to kill am bobo
fortune befriended me ever after but the richer i grew the more keenly i felt how wicked i had been and the more i foresaw that my victim's vengeance would some day overtake me
haunted by this thought i lost my nerve till one night i beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill
but how you manage to escape in her still alive is more than i can understand
a guilty man said the priest with a smile shudders at the rustling of the wind or the chattering of a stork speak a murderer's conscience praise upon his mind till he sees what is not
every well ordered jap ins home with the old fashioned kind has its little shrine which is the center of the religious life of the house
she it is who sets the rice and wine before the ancestral tablets who lights the little lamp each night and who sees that at each feast day in adversary season the proper food is prepared and set out for the household gods
these must be kept carefully by the mother is a safe guard against the many evils that beset child life
visits to noted temples by relatives and friends often result in additions to the child's collection
all these are put together by the careful mother and preserved as jealously as queen alba kept the charred stick that governed the destiny of her son
as the children arrived years of discretion these treasures pass out of the mother's faithful keeping into the hands of their actual owners and there usually kept scored away in some little used drawer or cabinet until death removes the necessity for any further safeguards over life
each animal brings its own kind of good or bad luck into the hour day or year over which it presides and only a skillful balances of pros and cons can read u write the combinations and understand what the luck of any particular hour in any particular day of any particular year will be
for the greater events of family life the hypotheses are felt to be too uncertain whom the services of the fortune teller must be called him
no well manage family would think of building a new house without finding in what direction to pace the front door
after this manner has been settled in the houses fairly begun there are occasional crises in its construction upon which much depends
of these the most important is the day when the roof is raised
the house owner then beside whether the days set by the builder is a lacking one for himself and his family
a present of money to each workman is also in order and will conduce to the rapid and faithful execution of the job man when at last the house is finished in carpenters and plasterers already to leave that the local firemen who have assisted all along in the building is unskilled laborers often ascend to the roof and from the ridgepole cast down cakes for which the children and the neighborhood scrambled joyfully
all come who can and those who cannot come send servants of provisions
on the day after the death often in the evening the body must be placed in a cask shaped cough net until recently was a style commonly amusing japan
now among the wealthier classes the long coffin has superseded the small square or round one but the smaller expense connected with the burial in the old way makes a survival of an old type a necessity for the majority of japanese
at an appointed time all the relatives assemble in the death chamber and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse
there is no official ceremonial mourning of parents for their children nor does custom require them to perform any of the last rights or attend the funeral
upon the younger brothers and sisters falls the duty of attending to all the last sad ministrations
when the body has been washed as is dressed in white in sil cabo tin whenever the family can informed
the body to be placed in the coffin must be fled into a sitting posture and the chin resting upon the knees the position of the mummies found in many aboriginal american tombs
this difficult to us apparently impossible feat safely accomplished there are placed in the coffin in number of small things that the dead takes with him to the next world
the single exception to this rule about metal is that small copper coins may be put in to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death
last of all the vacant spaces and the coffin are filled in with bags of tea
so long as the coffin is in the house it must be watched over continually
it is their duty to see that the incense burning before the coffin is never allowed to go out while the food for the dead is renewed regular intervals by the mourners themselves
there are few enlightened japanese who will defend the present system of cruelty to the afflicted or who do not long for some change but so great as the force of conservatism in this regard so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack of respect for the dead that reform advances slowly
individual instance as occur in which some of the worst features of these customs are modified
a case in point is that of the late mister fu czar a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countrymen in modern ways and who in his death continued his teaching
in his will he provided that his body was to be buried without washing in the clothing in which he died
through this growing feeling and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies
just before the procession starts a religious ceremony is held at the house which is attended by the friends of the deceased and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery
on the day of the burial great bunches of natural flowers are sent to the dead each bunch so large as to require the services one man to carry it
sometimes with the gift a man is sent to take part in the procession but if the giver fields too poor to hire a man this burden too falls upon the bereaved household for etiquette requires that all flowers sent be born to the grave by uniform coolies whom march in the funeral train
another favorite president this time among buddhists is a cage of living birds to be born to the grave and released thereon
it seems more like a bridal than a burial
during this period the spirit of the deceased is supposed to be still inhabiting the house and a tablet or shrine is set up in the death chamber before which food and flowers are renewed daily
he tarried at gen ashur a few days and came up to garda where i then resided he was apparently without any business that would support him but he soon became acquainted with my son thomas with whom he hunted for a long time and made his home with him at my house winter came on and he continued his day
the enraged husband well knowing that he should feel a blow if he waited to hear the order repeated instantly retreated and went down to river to his cattle
we protected the poor nic oak woman and gave her victuals and allans sympathized with her in her misfortunes display when her husband came to her acknowledged his former hors and that he had abused her without a cause for mister reformation and she received him with every mark o a renewal of her affection
the indians were soon answered by the american officer that the wampum was s gory accepted and that the continuance of peace was ardently wished for
my son thomas went with them with allan's horse and call ead the good
alleyne on finding that his enemies had gone came back to my house where he lived as before but of his return they were soon notified at niagara and nettles who married priscilla vans with the small party of indians came on to take him
nettles at length abandoned the chase went home and allen all in bors came in
by running in the woods his clothing had become torn into rags so that he was in a suffering condition almost naked
allen made his trousers himself and then built a raft on which he went down the river to his own place at mont mardas
there an indian gave him some refreshment and a good gun with which he hastened on to little beards down where he found his core
not daring to risk himself at that place for fear of being given up he made her but a short visit and came immediately to garda
the love of liberty however added to his natural swiftness gave him sufficient strength to make his escape to his formal castle of safety
his pursuers came immediately to my house where they expected to have found him secreted and under my protection
still unsatisfied and doubting my veracity they advised my indian brother to use his influence to draw from me the secret of his concealment which they had idea that i considered of great importance nor only to him but to my says i persisted in my ignorance of his situation and finally they left me
he came to my house in the night and awoke me with the greatest caution fearing that some of his enemies might be watching to take him at a time when and in a place where it would be impossible for him to make his escape
at that time allen lay in a secret place in the gulf a short distance above my flats in a hole that he accidently found in the rock near the river
praise little danger in this quarter venture so i'm me as well be french with the poor child
ah why not

the letter asking me to visit her was the first i have ever received from her

such a girl then it had never been her privilege to have before and when her suspicions were forgotten she became fairly responsive and brightened wonderfully
silas she said rey entered what do you think of my nieces

why does you not invite cenis to danin the boy
he is constantly saying disagreeable things

asked the old lady af propose i cannot say on so short an acquaintance he answered with gravity which do you prefer jane
they are equally unsatisfactory she answered
i cannot imagine elmhurst belongs to either silas
i must see that agonies the one who defies me and refuses to answer my second letter
there would be a dozen airs to fight for my money and dear all elmhurst would be sold to strangers she resumed with bitterness
in one corner of the little room canned forbes squatted upon a bench with an empty pine box head carelessly in his lap
while jankin worked the boy was busy with his fences but neither had spoken foras a half hour
then riding slowly up the head bordered rod his troubles once more assailed him and he wondered if there was not some spot upon the broad earth to which he could fly for retirement until the girls had left almost for good
nora shied and he looked up to discover that he had nearly run down a pedestrian a stout little man with a bundle lumber his arm who held up one hand as to arrest him

thank you lad returned the man gratefully i thought a little exercise would do me good but this three mile has seemed like thirty to me

the boy turned away but in a moment halted again
his interest in miss jane's brother john was extraordinary
they are but luxan lovers who can content themselves with the dialogue carried on at bu short distance
if there be an ely human it is this
his own daughter his only daughter of the best blood of southern aristocracy beautiful accomplished everything to secure him a splendid alliance holding nightly assignation with a harse hunter
he could well concede so much to her caprice since her staying at home could be no disadvantage to the cause that had prompted him to the stern counsel
it is already known that this road passed the hacienda of casa del corvo at some distance from the house and on the opposite side of the river
on reaching the corpse he dismounted led his horse in among th underwood hitched him by looping his brighten gain around the topmost twigs of an i lasting bow then detaching a long rope of twisted horse hair from the horn of his saddle and inserting his arm into its coil he glided out to the edge of the island on that side that lay towards the hussy ea
the four forsaking the shadow of the corpse he cast a glance towards the sky and at the moon sailing supremely over it
the droll conceit which has so often mused the nocturnal in avery of great cities appeared to produce a like effect upon the night pat ruler of the prairie and for a moment the shadow laid darkening his brawl disappeared
it's not likely it this are unless it be the owner of a bad punctions who can't sleep
croft there's one such within those walls
if he be abroad there's a good chance of his seeing me on the open ground not that i should care a straw if it were only myself to be compromised
it's no use waiting upon the moon you stake her
it is true he had designs upon the hacienda but these did not contemplate either its gash flight or jelly if we except the most precious jeweller contained the mistress of the mansion herself
the church bells were ringing and people on the avenue going by to service turned curious inquiring looks up at the great house and then went on talking with the recent events which had so strangely entered into and made history in the city
and all through his impassion appeal this morning there was a note of sadness and rebuke and stern condemnation that made many of the members pale with self accusation or with inward anger
raymond had voted to continue for another year the saloon
the christians of laymen stood condemned by the result
for that had been the fact in raymond for years the saloon ruled
president march sat there his usual erect handsome firm bright self confident bearing all gone his head bowed upon his breast the great tears rolling down his cheeks unmindful of the fact that never before had he shown outward emotion in a public service
what if he had begun to do as jesus would have done long ago
when had the first church yielded to such a baptism of tears
what had become of its regular precise conventional order of service undisturbed by any vulgar emotion and unmoved by any foolish excitement
they had been living so long on their surface feelings that they had almost forgotten the deeper wells of life
the meeting was tender it glowed with the spirit's presence it was alive with strong and lasting resolve to begin a war on the whisky power and raiment that would break its rain for ever
since the first sunday when the first company of volunteers had pledged themselves to do as jesus would do the different meetings had been characterized by distinct impulses or impressions
and all through it ran one general cry for deliverance from the saloon in a towle curse
grey and his wife were besieged by inquirers who wanted to know what loring's friends and acquaintances were expected to do in paying their last respects to her
grey had gone up to virginia's and after talking it over with her and maxwell the arrangement had been made
i am and always have been opposed to large public funerals said grey whose complete wholesome simplicity of character was one of its greatest sources of strength but the cry of the poor creatures who knew loreen is so earnest that i did not know how to refuse this desire to see her and pay her poor body some last little honour what do you think mister maxwell
i will be guided by your judgment in the matter
i am sure that whatever you and this page thank best will be right
under the circumstances i have a great distaste for what seems like display at such times but this seems different
it happened that that afternoon a somewhat noted newspaper correspondent was passing through gram ment on his way to an editorial convention in a neighboring city
she was a common street drunkards and yet the services of the tent were as impressive as any i ever witnessed in a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen
it struck me of course being a stranger in the place with considerable astonishment to hear voices like those one naturally expects to hear only in great churches or concerts at such a meeting as this
mister maxwell spoke of the fact that the dead woman had been fully prepared to go but he spoke in a peculiarly sensitive manner of the effect of the liquor business on the lives of men and women like this one
raymond of course being a railroad town and the center of the great packing interests for this region is full of saloons
then follow what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service
it was one of the simplest and at the same time one of the most impressive sights i ever witnessed
there must have been a hundred of these women and i was told many of them had been converted at the meetings just recently
there was no answer and after one or two ineffectual attempts pansy turned fearfully away
i'll try and she laid a quick can on the m
two red spots burned on her cheeks and her pale blue eyes snapped
i'm sure i heard it raging up and down
i don't want any dinner said charlotte drawing back
yes indeed said polly cheerily just as fine as can be
assuredly said old mister king with great satisfaction in polly's pleasure and at her success enjoying charlotte out
and after this there were no more quiet days for charlotte chatterton
oh bess me at too phronsie in pleased surprise
yes grandpapa said phronsie coming in and shutting that are carefully i came on purpose to see you all along
so you did dear said mister king highly gratified and pushing away his writing table he held out his hand
oh no grandpapa cried phronsie in rapture i could never be too big for that so she perched up as of old honest name then she folded her hands and looked gravely in his face
well my dear what is it
asked the old gentleman presently you've come to tell me something i suppose
yes grandpapa i have said phony decidedly and it is most important too glad papa oh i do wish it so much and she'd clasped her hands tighter inside
well then phronsie if you wanted i suppose it must be said mister king quite as a matter of course
oh she loft you everything she had phronsie a pupa of millions or so it is why
charlotte poor repeated the old gentleman
why no not exactly her father is rich but charlotte think they do very well especially as i intend to keep her here for a while and then i shall never let her suffer phronsie never indeed
grandpapa said phronsie wasn't missus chatterton aunt to charlotte
if missus chatterton was aunt de charlotte persisted phronsie slowly it seems as if charlotte ought to have some of the money it really does grandpapa
maybe said the old gentleman with a short laugh and i shouldn't wonder if cousin yunus was sorry over a few other things too phronsie
wouldn't it make her very glad if i gave shall that some of the money
for answer mister king set her down hastily on the floor and took two or three turns up and down the room
oh i do so wish i might she said so much for a little girl like me
it will be so nice to have charlotte half some with me still no answer
i was writing a note to missus bargo said phronsie putting up her lips for kiss
sure as i can be phronsie said old mister king smiling good bye dear
there there wry sister's boy shall never say that but come in come in
not to be ungracious the young man three himself into a chair
oh hang it uncle why can't you let me alone
which is a wonder interpolated pickering
i know you did uncle said pickering you've done everything that's good
for heaven's sake pickering cried his uncle darting in front of the chair and its breastless ought to that don't say that again
i've been a lazy dog all my life and good for not but i hope i've not sunk to that
the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous fresh of a starry eyed flushed cheeked young woman who demanded
where is he pete miss billy gasped the old man
aunt hannah's cheeks too were flushed and her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way pete had said miss billy's name
it was one matter for her to object to this thing billy was doing but quite another for pete to do it of course it's she
retorted aunt hanna testily as if you yourself to bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night pete where is he
interposed billy tell mister bertram i'm here or wait i'll go right it in surprise it
pete had recovered himself by now but he did not even glanced toward aunt hannah
miss billy miss billy you're an angel straight from heaven you are you are oh i'm so glad you came
it'll be all right now all right he's in to dad miss billy
billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall aunt hanna's indignant voice arrested her billy stopped
pete go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receive us pets lips twitched
but his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke
a flying figure brushed by him and fell on it seized by the couch with a low cry bertram's eyes flew open
don ling found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over bertram's tray
in the hall above aunt hannah was crying into william's gray when in duster that hung on the hall rack aunt hanna's handkerchief was on the floor back at hillside
then very gradually it dawned over them that there was after all something strange and unexplained at at all
as if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closer bertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable
why oh of course stammered billy i couldn't help thinking that maybe you had found out you didn't want me
demanded bertram angry and mystified
as for my not painting again you didn't understand and pete deary
she pulled herself half away from bertram's encircling arm
billy your quivering sigh
good heavens is kate and this too bertram's voice was savage now
well she wrote a letter
billy laughed gaily but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes
and you never did think for a minute billy that you cared for him
he had not been slow to marked that swift lowering for eyelids
billy was so glad bertram had turned the question on her love instead of arkwright's
after a minute billy stirred and sighed happily
you see i wasn't in love with mister arkwright
and and you didn't care it speciall be for from miss win up
billy put a soft finger on his lips
bertin kissed the finger and subsided humph he commented
well what is that is that kate too demanded bertram grimly
there was another silence then suddenly bertram stirred
billy i'm going to marry you to morrow he announced decisively
i don't know as i can trust you out of my sight till then you'll read something or hear something or get a letter from kate after breakfast tomorrow morning that will set you saving me again and i don't want to be saved that way
i'm going to marry you tomorrow i'll get he stopped short with a sudden frown confound that law i forgot
five days indeed sir
i wonder if you think i can get ready to be married in five days
don't want you to get ready retorted bertram promptly i saw marie at ready and i had all i wanted of it
if you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace ruffling will do it afterwards not before but
besides i need you to take care of me cut in bertram craftily
the tender glow on billy's face told its own story and bertram's eager eyes were not slow to read it
sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm
billy my dear
it was aunt hannah's plaintive voice at the doorway a little later
we must go home and william is here too and wants to see you
you mean it'll be before october
aunt hanna glazed from one to the other uncertainly
yes nodded billy demurely
yes i know that is a good while cut in bertram marly
we wanted it tomorrow what we had to wait on account of the new license law
yet so strong was the effect upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectation of the wood which should make him rich
a part of that impression was due to be engagement which he must now fulfil
to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes
because in his salad days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many charms step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that raw attachment
unable to think of work he left the house and wandered gloomily about legions park
he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marian who was fate's instrument
he wrote to marian
will you let me hear or come and seem
i scarcely thought of bel as likely to kill himself
but why that juice did he go all the way hel there
i hoped he would bring me subdued
poverty i can only suppose
but i will see well down i hadn't come across biffin for a long time
was he still so merry poor
asked amy compassionately
i'm afraid si his book failed utterly
oh if i had imagined him still in such distress surely i might have done something to help you
perchance his death was in part attributable to that hopeless love
he sent me a copy of his novel she said and i saw him once or twice after that
having this subject to converse upon put the two more quickly at east than could otherwise have been the case
amy might take a foremost place among living women
especially now that her father is threatened with blindness
is it so serious
even if mister yule recovers his side it is not at all likely that he will be able to work as before
our difficult is a so grave that
he paused and let his hand failed despondently
i have a good deal of will you remember and what i have set my mind upon no doubt i shall some day achieve
there were palms
the last three years he continued have made no slight difference in my position
recall where i stood when you first knew be
just now i am in need of a little encouragement
you don't notice any fooling off in my work recently
did you see my things in the current and so on generally
sometimes i believe i have detected you when there was no signature
her storing at that girl's paper has attracted attention
and i could so easily put her of rest by renouncing all claim upon her
i surmise that that you yourself would also be put at rest by such a decision
don't look at me with that ironical smile he pleaded
i couldn't go about declaring that i was heartbroken in any event i must be content for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgments are pretty sure to be unfavorable what can i do
the case is too delicate i fear for my advice
well i'll go back to my script
again just beheld the white soft hand for a superfluous moment
yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry
balan could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companion's smooth countenance
she had divined that there was some grave reason for this sums and the paining with which she approached was half caused by the anxious beats of her heart
he began abruptly
he gave her such details as he had obtained then added
there were two of my companions fallen in the battle
i ought to think myself a lucky fell i marry what
you would better fit to fight your way jasper
more of the great remained
here no very well i don't
i have made up my mind about our affairs he went tor presently
yes
will you marry them and let us take their chance
you feel yourself indispensable to your father at present
i should be so afraid of the effect upon his health jasper
she paused and looked up at him touchingly
dear i can't feel it would be my duty to renounce you because my father had become blind
has one thing occurred to you
will he consent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is missus millbay
and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him
she listened anxiously and reflected
as i have said there is a very serious doubt whether your father would accept money for you when you are my wife
it isn't your fault marian and well then there's only one thing to do
except jasper that if father is helpless i must find means of assuring his support
do you think them insurmountable
that is just what i have decided is impossible m you shall have the plain truth
i don't trust myself
that shall y face them willingly
put up your unc bella marian
what do i care for a drop of vein she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is at stake how am i to understand you
every word you speak seems intended to dishearten me
why need you conceal if that is the truth
is that what you mean by saying you distrust yourself
we must see each other again marian
how am i to live an hour in such uncertainty as this
i do wish it
her emotion had an effect on him and his voice trembled
there is no natural law that a child should surrender everything for her parents
you know so much more of the world that i did can't you advise me
does that no way of providing for my father
good god this is frightful marian i can't stand it
i will be faithful to you
he had made a pretence of holding his umbrella over her but marian turned away and walked to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a great tree her face averted from him
moving to follow he saw that her frame was shaken by soundless sobbing
in what can there be more selfishness
but i couldn't say on word that would seem to invite such misery as this
you don't love me jasper and that's an end of everything
happiness or misery come to us by fight
is it in my power to make you happy
but if you had said you loved me before that i should have it always to remember
if i believe anything i believe that i did love you
what can you say to me more than you have said now
remember me as a man who disregarded priceless love such as yours to go and make himself a proud position among fools and knaves indeed that one come to
soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merited my perverse pride would revolt against it
what can be simpler than the truth
it is a thing that happens every day either in a man or woman and all honour demands is the courage to confess the truth
marianne will you do this will you let her engagement last for another six months but without o meeting during that time
that seems to be childish
the rain fell unceasingly and with it began to mingle an autumnal mist
jasper laid a moment then asked calmly
are you going to the museum yes
go home again for this morning marian you can't work
they must and i have no time to lose
good bye she gave him her hand
they looked at each other for an instant then marian left the shelter of the trim opened her umbrella and walked quickly away
jasper did not watch her he had the face of a man who was suffering a severe humiliation
her sister said very little for she recognized genuine suffering in his times and aspect
a few weeks ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest affection but who is very rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him
yesterday morning he received her final answer by refusal
you will understand though surely you need no fresh proof how utterly unworthy he is of you
you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you
several days passed before there came a reply
i must only ask that you will write to me without the least reference to these troubles tell me always about yourself and be sure that you cannot tell me too much
we had then but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of the covenant which was requisite for determination of the problem
several different parties were therefore organized to examine the various routes supposed to be practicable within the northern and southern limits of the united states
the only discrimination made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the surveys
he inquiries were made with regard to good powder which subsequently led to the use of a coarser grain for artillery
the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil wife
under instructions from the president the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution
after some further discussion of the question the visitors withdrew dissatisfied with the result of the interview
the quartermaster general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake at the appointing to the office had been confounded with his father who was a well known whig but that he the son was a democrat
i assured the general that this was altogether immaterial adding that it was a very pretty quarrel as it stood and that i had no a desire to effect a settlement of it on any inferior issue
nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the fox found a very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size
if you want to hunt your harriers on foot sixteen inches is quite big enough almost too big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches as a useful height or even nineteen inches
it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule asked color it is so much a matter of individual taste
but puppies are usually sent out to walk and may easily be procured to be captain reared until theyre old enough to be hindered to their work
he is of course finer but with the length of neck so perfect in the bigger hound the little shoulders of the same pattern and the typical quarters and second fives
and when he is fairly on a line of course he sticks to it as the saying is like a beagle
it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otter hound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of good eighteen inches can an almost identical contemporary that was called the essex beagle
that a great many of the true order were bred became very manifest as soon as the harrier and beagle association was formed and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hound show was reserved for them
then they seemed to spring from every part of the country
one hears now of the chilstone the house to place very noted indeed the halt the lea park the stoke place the edinburgh the surbiton the trinity foot the wood dale missus judo hills missus prices and missus turners
eyes brown dark hazel poor hazel not deep set nor bulgy and with a mild expression

shoulders clean and slightly sloping
forelegs white street fell under the dog of good substance and round in the bone
feet round well knuckling up and strongly padded
coat smooth variety smooth very dense and not too fine or short

all things which follow from the absolutely nature of any attribute of god must always exist and be infinite or in other words are each charnel and infinite through they said attribute
proof conceive if it be possible supposing the proposition to be denied that something in some attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of these said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought
in its nature infinite
must necessarily exist
we have now granted therefore thought not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of god does not naturally follow from its nature in so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of god which is against our apotheosis
and beyond the limits of the duration of the idea of god supposing the latter at some time not to have existed for not to be going to exist thought would perforce have existed without the idea of god which is contrary to our hypothesis for we suppose that thought being given the idea of god necessarily flowed therefrom
bear in mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from god's absolute nature
corollary hence it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is ins colic phraseology god is cause of the being of things as siny rem
corollary individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of god or modes by which the attributes of god are expressed in a fixed and definite manner
such a call such a time you never did see
i was wishing somebody would give the conversation a start we indiana made a break
this ain't no great stock country says he to the old gentleman with the cane

never mind polly said jasper there's all next summer and after our winter and dressed in and all our hard work over music one of thee fine those at jaunt round again and his eyes glistened
and you'll go on drawing and painting till you get to be a great artist ran on polly enthusiastically and then we'll see something you've done in the louve maybe the louve cried adela oh dear me polly pepper
tom selwyn had been very sober during all this merry chatter and now in his seat across the narrow aisle he drummed his heels impatiently on the floor
what's up little mother asked tom in surprise at her unusual manner it's us this tom
when the news was circulated as it was pretty soon that the party was not to be broken into it all till paris was a completed story the jubilation was such as to satisfy even tom
oh isn't it oates peas beans and barley girl cried polly as they watched them intently
and his long arm went out and picked to jack and end of an urchin who incautiously regarding such quiet travellers is not worth minding had hovered too near while trying to tease the girls
and presently a woman came and took little blue pen afore off and then the rest of the girls unclasped their hands and the ring melted away and the game was over
i'm glad the girl's over here half fun said polly as grandpapa is party moved off isn't it nice to think they do
two or three days of rest at martini put everyone in good shape and gave them all a bit of time to pick up on many little things that worked behindhand
that's my third letter polly announced jasper on the other side of the table now i'm going to begin on jules
one two said polly counting why i thought i'd written three while this one is most finished jasper
dare said tom delighted to think that no terrible result had really ensued from his words that after they were out had scared him mightily
i'll posts too polly give them here
then his face brightened and he said and she's right polly while polly fish took frank out of joe's little money bag that hung in her belt
do get the stamps please jasper and put them on and he took up her two letters and she gave the bag a little pat for joe's sake wishing it was his stubby black hair that her fingers could touch
i don't know where we are going to get nice wight paper far around robin said polly leaning her epics on the table and her chin in her hands i know ejaculated tom whirling on his heel and dashing out
i want polly too said phronsie wriggling away from the pen that polly held out alluringly
phronsie who hadn't heard what polly said her small head being full of the responsibility of beginning the important letter and considering since it was to be done it was best to have it over with as soon as possible felt as scribbling a letters as fast as she could all them running downhill
it's all right grand adele like it he said
i tell you you don't know my grand daddy he's cot lots fun in him he added
i won't cry any more declared phronsie wiping off the last tear trailing down the nose
then i shall be all as well as ever said polly kissing the wet little face
we must put them little pictures said polly tried to make herself cheery as the work went busily on
polly you always do think of the best things exclaimed jasper beaming at her which made her try harder than ever to smile
i wouldn't feel so badly polly he managed to a spur when phronsie was absorbed with her work though i could probably just his father did the cinch bread boy
he seems to accomplish something every time he goes observed jasper dryly hullo just look at him now
oh dear me exclaimed adela as her scissors slipped now you've draggled the table again then she caught polly's eye
rather not much obliged tom bobbed his thanks
picture after picture cut from railroad guide books illustrated papers and it seemed to jasper gathered as if by magic with cunning little photographs broke up the letter and wound in and out with funny and charming detail of some of their journey
the rest of it is nice whispered jasper and i ventured to say that i'll like that the best of all
mister king thought so too and he beamed at phronsie so you did he cried now that's fine i wish you'd write meal letter some time
but what can i do so small and stupid and shy as i am
i must find some way to give the little ones a nice christmas
tom will like to have me goeth him and sing while he places harp in the streets
yes i will try and then if i do well but when one shall have a merry christmas
but see then it is cold in the streets the wind bites and the snow freezes one singers
she thanked tom o and ran away to get ready for she felt sure her father would not release her anything
then she washed out little rance's frock and put it to dry because she would not be able to do it the next day
she longed to make the beds and dressed the children over night she was in such a hurry to have all in order but as i could not be she sat down again and tried over all the songs she knew
when she had told her plan peter bardi shook his head and thought it would never do m tessa begged so hard he consented at last that she should try it for one a week and sent her to bed the happiest little girl in new york
as soon as her father was gone tessa flew about and put everything in nice order telling the children she was going out for the day and they were to mind tom's mother who would see about the fire in the dinner for the good woman loved tessa and entred into her little plans with all her heart
poor tess's heart beat fast as she trudged away with tao who slung his harp over his shoulder and gave her his hand
it was rather a dirty hand but so kind that tessa clung to it and kept looking up at the friendly brown face for encouragement
say now have no fear give them bel monica that is marian will make the laugh whispered tommo tuning his har
when faddle french but nodded to her and it seemed to help her very much for she began to sing before she thought and that was the hardest part of it
but tommo shook as curly head and answered supply yes i took you there first for they love music and honor of our country but up among the great houses we shall not always do well
but she had made half a dollar for tumbler divided and money fairly and she felt rich with her share
her hands were covered with chilblains where she had no mittens but she had put them under her shawl and shuffled merrily away in her big boots feeling so glad that the week was over and nearly three dollars safe in her pocket
how gave the streets were that day
how brisk everyone was and help bright the faces looked as people trotted about with big baskets holly wreaths and young evergreens going to blossom into splendid christmas trees
but i can't so i'll fill the socks all full and be happy s tessa as she looked wistfully into the gay stores and saw the heavy baskets go by
who knows what may happen if would you well return tommo nodding wisely for he had plan as well as tessa and kept chuckling over it as he charged through the mud
w try one more street and then go home thou so tired little one
at the fourth some people let them sing all their songs and gave nothing
tessa felt so grateful that without waiting for tommo she sang her sweetest little song all alone
i'll ask mamma said rose and away she went into the dining room close by
as the door opened tessa sal would looked to her like a fairy feast all silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine and tall glass pictures and smoking dishes that smelt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfaction
ah yes i shall come with much gladness and play as never in my life before cried tommo with a flourish of the old cap that made the children laugh
give these to your brother said the fairy prince stuffing nuts and oranges and to test his hands
all so time so very kind i have no way to say thank you but runs shall be for you a heavenly angel and i will sing my heart out for your treat cried tessa folding the mittens if she would say ary of thankfulness if she knew how
she got up early to see if the socks were all right and there she found the most astonishing sight
four socks instead of three and by the fourth pinned out quite elegantly was a little dress evidently meant for her o warm woollen dress all made and actually with bright buttons on it
tessa screamed and danced in her delight and up tumbled all the children to scream and dance with her making a regular carnival in small scale
in her long stocking she found all sorts of treasures for twel had stuffed it full of queer things and his mother had made ginger bed into every imaginable shape from fat pigs to full omnibuses
little lance was accepted with delight by the kind lady in her children and tess lorn the song quite easily
arose from the crowd of children gathered to the festival
before they went home the kind mama told tessa he should be her friend and give her motherly kiss which wm the child's heart in fet a p seal upon that promise
the senator took his seat in the pulpit with the minister on one side of him and the superintendent of the sunday school on the other
so odd were they by the presence of a living united states senator that during three minutes not a spit ball was thrown
after that they began to come to themselves by degrees and presently the spell was wholly gone and they were reciting verses and polly hair
the usual sunday school exercises were hurried through and then the minister got up and board the house with a speech built on the customary sunday school plan then the superintendent put in his ore and then the town dignitaries had their say
am i am some populous centre of my own country where the choicest children of the land have been selected and brought together as at a fair for a prize no
then where am i yes where am i
my soul is lost in wonder at the thought
earth has no higher no grander position for me
then what is it what did my consciousness reply
ah think of that now i could hardly keep the tears back i was so grateful
they could not give him a costly education but they were good and wise and they sent him to the sunday school he loved the sunday school
i hope you love your sunday school i see by your faces that you do that is right
always love your teachers my children for they love you more than you can know now
and by and by the people made him governor and he said it was all owing to the sunday school
why the people gave him a towering illustrious position a grand imposing position
it was senator of the united states
that poor little boy that loved his friendly school became not man that man stands before you
above all things my children be honest
once under dilworthy departed from cattle ville he left three dozen boys behind him arranging a campaign of life whose objective point was the united stat senate
w luck is a delightful child
there was no their such child there never had been and there never would be
while aga's mother seraphim alexandrovna was sure that
bloch hiss eyes were dark and large her cheeks or rosy her lips were made for kisses and for laughter
but it was not these chimes and elect ga that gave her mother the keenest joy
she felt cold with her husband
he was always fresh and cool with a frigid smile and wherever he passed cold current sink move in the air
it even seemed at seraphim alexandrovna that she was in love with her future husband and this made her happy
the brag was also good looking she was a tall dark eyed dark haired girl somewhat to made but very tactful
he had connections and his wife came a good influential people
this might at the proper opportunity prove useful
after their marriage there was nothing in the manner of sir ya modoc to suggest anything wrong to his wife
later however when his wife was about to have a child ser again lodovico established connections elsewhere of a light and temporary nature
spa alexandrovna found the couch and to her own astonishment was not particularly hurt she awaited her infant with a restless anticipation that swallowed every other feeling
seraphim alexandrovna drifted farther and farther away from him
u latch ga then ran away stamping with her plump little legs over the carpets and hid herself behind the curtains near her bed
where is my baby girl the mother asked as she looked for l latch ga may believe that she did not see her
then she came out a little farther and her mother as though she had only just caught sight of her seized her by her little shoulders and exclaimed joyously here she is my aleck
her mother's eyes glowed with passionate emotion
her mother went to hide
goleta turned away as though not to see but watched hera match ga stealthily all the time
where is mayor mothah asked lala
a smile of absolute bliss played on her red lips
roulette goes getting nearer her mother's corner
her mother was growing more absorbed every moment by her interest in the game her heart beat with short quick strokes and she pressed even closer to the wall disarranging her hair still more
luka suddenly glanced toward her mother's corner and screamed with joy
through the half close doors he heard the laughter the joyous outcries the sound of romping
even fedosya felt abashed now for her mistress now for herself
he liked coming here where everything was beautifully arranged this was done by seraphim alexandrovna who wished to surround her little girl from her very infancy only with the loveliest things
seraphim ma alexandrina dressed herself tastefully this too she did for l latch ga with the same end in view
one thing sergey modo witch had not become reconciled to and this was his wife's almost continuous presence in the nursery
it's just as i thought i knew that i'd find you here he said with a deserving condescending smile
merely you see that the child should feel its own individuality he explained in answer to seraphim ina al sandro ma's puzzled plants
she still so little said seraphim thea alexandrovna
i don't insist it's your kingdom here
i'll think it over his wife answered smiling as he did coldly but genially
then they began to talk with something else
that the mistress does it while that's one thing but that the young lady does it that's bad
why asked fido si curiosity
this expression of curiosity gave her face the look of a wooden roughly painted doll
yes that's bad repeated agatho a conviction terribly bad well
it's the truth i'm saying remember my words agafya went on at the same assurance and secrecy
it's the sheerest sign
the old woman had invented this sign quite suddenly herself and she was evidently very proud of it
madame madam she said quietly in a trembling voice
seraphim ma alexandrovna gave a start
f dot's face made her anxious
what is it fiducia she asked with break concern as there anything wrong with walt ga
no madam said fedosya she gesticulated with her hands to reassure her mistress and to make her sit down
latch cause a sleep may god be with her
only i'd like to say something you see we latch ges always hiding herself that is not good
i can't tell you how bad it is said fidel thia and her face expressed the most decided confidence
i understand nothing of what you are saying
you see madam it's a kind of omen explains fedosya abruptly and the shamefaced way
nonsense said seraphim alexandrovna
who told you all this asked seraph ma alexandrovna in austere low voice
nos exclaimed seraphim alexandrovna irritation as though she wished to protect herself somehow from this sudden anxiety
what nonsense as though the latch good could die
she saw clearly that there could be no possible connection between a child's quite ordinary diversion and the continuation of the child's life
she made a special effort that evening to occupy her mind with other matters but her thoughts turned involuntarily to the fact that will latch go love to hide herself
when the latch was still quite small and had learned a distinguished between her mother and her nurse she sometimes sitting in her nurse's arms made a sudden rugg hish grimace and hid her laughing face and the nurse's shoulder
then she would look out with a sly glance
though she reproached herself at once for this unfounded superstitious dread nevertheless she could not end her wholeheartedly into the spirit wi luck's favorite game and she tried to divert ella's attention to something else
she eagerly complied with their mother's new wishes
seraphim ma alexandrovna tried desperately to amuse gala
perhaps th seraphim alexandrovna she is not as strongly drawn to the world as other children who attracted by many things
if this is so is it not a sign of organic meekness
spy mow cinna herself began the game once or twice though she played it with a heavy heart
she suffered as though committing an evil deed with full consciousness
it was a sad day for seraph ma alexandrovna
her mother covered her with a blue blanket
luka drew her sweet little hands from under the blanket and stretched them out to embrace her mother her mother bent down
she seemed so small and so frail under the blanket that covered her
seraph la alexandrovna remained standing over lea's bed a long while and she kept looking at l latch gender ness and fear
i'm a mother is it possible that i shouldn't be able to protect her she thought as she imagined the various ills that might be flock
she prayed long that night but the prayer did not relieve her sadness
several days passed will latch vico cold
the fever came upon her at night
when seraphim ma alexandrovna awakened by fedosya came to will latch gun saw her looking so hot so restless and so tormented she instantly recalled the evil omen and a hopeless disparity possession of her from the first moments
our doctor was called and everything was done that as usual on such occasions but the inevitable happened
and l luca grew feebler from hour to hour
nothing made her so unhappy as the reiteration of fedosya uttered between sobs she hid herself and hid herself arletta
fever was consuming relet ga and there were times when she lost consciousness and spoken delirium
three days passed torturing like a nightmare
spa alexandrovna hid her face behind the curtains near lilla's bed how tragic
i'll wait m march go whispered l log ga
mom much ga white face became blurred and everything grew dark before ll chica
she met her husband
spini alexandrovna was standing by the coffin and looking dully at her dead child
sama my dear don't agitate yourself said sergeant loto so wich in a whisper
you must resign yourself to your fate
she'll be up in a minute persisted ser female alexandrovna her eyes fixed on the dead little girl
sergey load disproved looked round him cautiously he was afraid of the unseemly and of the ridiculous
see i don't agitate yourself he repeated
he was confused and annoyed
her face seemed tranquil and her eyes were dry
she went into the nursery and began to walk round the room looking into those places where ll chica used to hide herself
she walked all about the room and then now and ber look under the table under the bed and captain repeating cheerfully where's my little one where is my loach ca
after she had walked round the room once she began to make her question you
fedosya motionless with dejected face sat in a corner and looked frightened at her mistress then she suddenly burst out sobbing and she wailed loudly
she hid herself and hid herself are l latch guy at angelic little soul
when she entered the parlor there was several people between her and malacca
there was an oppressive feeling of heaviness and seraphim alexandrovna's he as she approached loath ga
w watch go lay there still and pale and smiled pathetically
the little one did not reply
seraphim alexandrovna stood up erect side in a lost way smiled and called loudly bleat ga
we much goes being carried out
captain bull the commander of a small garrison at seabrook permitted him to land but when the governor began to read his commission bull ordered him to be silent
what has happened mister prince was worth asked for he could see that the man was greatly excited governor andrews was come again gasped mister prince why should that alarm us the fellow they' get into boasting is not dangerous or liable to put his threats into execution but he was grown dangerous declared mister prince the liberties of the coloni are involved
captain wadsworth became a little uneasy though he was still inclined to treat the matter lightly
we have surely refused to yield our charge involuntarily for it is the guardian of our political rights
that is true cap and wadsworth continued mister prince and to subdue our stubbornness this v story has come to hartford with sixty armed men to demand the surrender of the charter in person
captain walworth founded to his feet in a rage and placing his hand on the hilt of his sword declared he shall not have it
the day was well nice spent when he arrives and the members were engaged in a heated debate on a subject of the utmost importance
he consented however to await the discussion but as soon as it was ended he declared that he would have the charter
after that captain had taken two or three turns across the room he paused and asked
what is the assembly doing engaged in debate
and will he wait until it ended he has promised to do so
mister prince fixed hiss amazed eyes on the captain's face and read their desperate determination captain he again
mister prince bowed and hastily returned to the house to where the assembly was in session
as soon as he was gone charles steed and said
yes charles you will answer what do you mean uncle
never did debaters take greater interest in a minor subject
what do you intend doing uncle will you fight them
remember the work must be done right at the time not too soon nor to wait
the sun was setting and the captain said
come charles let us hasten to the assembly
by no means but i want you to be fully in crested with a seriousness of your mission
take your please charles and be prepared to do your part whispered captain watchword
charles god is close to the long capable use by the secretaries is possible without attracting special attention
the discussion went on darkness came and four lighted candles were placed on the table in two set on a shelf on the wall
those two candles on the wall were agreed anoints to charles until he saw a man station near them
though the lights were extinguished through the window the faint starlit dimly illuminated the scene
he followed him as rapidly as he could
these was close behind him and when they were outsides used his arm
oh i had a care how you approached me
the soldiers began the crowd about the house when at a signal from tacking wadsworth the train vans came on the scene and prepared to grapple with the soldiers
whereas the charter
you have your soldiers at the door and we have the train bands of connecticut ready to defend us against violence
who of you has the charter
it was the boy cries in range governor
every member of the assembly shook their heads
we do not know him he does not looking american where does he live
little did the captain or his youthful assistant dream that their simple act would make the old tree historic
the tree in which the doctorate was hitting was ever afterwards known as charter oak
it remained v gris bearing fruit every year and tittle a little after midnight august eighteen fifty sixth when it was prostrated by a heavy storm of wind
when the order from the seizure of the charters was first made known the assembly roy land scent a most loyal aging saying
he formerly resolved the assembly broke the seal of the colony which bore the figure of an anchor and the word hope and mitted five in the inhabitants into his legislative council and assumed the function of governor but he did not take away the parchment on which the charter was written
from that time until before union of the colonies t mutual defense at the bursting out of the friends in indian war the inhabitants of rhode island or their share in the defensive efforts especially when the hostile savages hung along their french is new york like an ill omened cloud
the history is that commonwealth is identified with that of all new england from the beginning of king william's war soon after the expulsion of ands
colbert who had heard his uncle getting ready to run down to the water's edge
it's a schooner said mister bingham to mister mint and she h a very heavy cargo
to this cord was fastened a heavy rope or table
what's that board for asper as he saw board following the teale
that's the directions said how
they are printed in the number of languages and they tell the crew to carry the end of the cable high up to the mast and fastened it strongly there
oh i see said berg the lang will stretch then and the breeches boo will go out on a pulley
it was clear day nail and much of the wicked storm had passed
with the daylight king girls of women to the beach
missus bobbsey missus minturn marie and her mother besides dorothy at ma'am were all there flossie and freddy being obliged to say home with dinah and susan
of course the girls asked all sorts of questions and burton how tried to answer them as best they could
it seemed the long time before any movement of the cable showed that the bully was returning
nearer and nearer i came until now a man's head could be seen
the girls and women were too frightened to talk and nelly clung close to her mother
a big roller dashing and finished the work for the lice birds and a man in the coarse felt banded upon shore
everybody gathered around and nelly with a strange face and a stranger hope broke through the crowd to see the rescued man
oh it is my father she screamed falling right into the ears of the drenched man
but the half dreamed man rubbed his eyes as if he should not believe them then the next minute he pressed his little daughter to his heart unable to speak a word
and as george bringing out there anxiously asked the brother
safe and well came the welcome answer
i guess our prayers were her at last night
she had come another man exclaimed the people as this time a big man dashed on sands
while i declare we did land on a friendly shore
just as mister bingham said though lie saving work turned out to be a social affair for there was a great time greeting nell's father and how's uncle
and how on his father too put in man
what a morning that was at sunset beach
i'm so glad we prayed said little flossie freddy when she heard the good names
a beautiful day had grown out of the dreadful storm
and everybody was so happy
the neptune the vessel that had struck on the sand fi was now safely anchored near shore and the sailors came in and out in rowboats back and forth to land just as they wished
then we had to go back to work at the logs went on the captain and then one of our crew took a fever
that was what galena so
finally we had every wall blowed on the schooner and we started off
we canted on getting home last week when this last storm struck us and droll us out of our course
about the value asked mister bobbsey who was down t the city
the value repeated the captain aside so that the strangers might not hear
while i am a rich man now and so is my mate mc ruin for that wood was contracted for by the largest and richest piano firm in this country and now it is all but delivered to them and the money in our hands
yes indeed it would have taken us a lifetime to a king way with much money as we have earned in this yer
maybe aunt emily will take you down to the city on her shopping tour suggested nan
he made the clerks to move all the trucks from the isles and i guess everybody was glad the army fell down
the wonderful fresh air that these men lived in night and day had brightened their eyes too so that even the plainest faced and the most awkward man among them was as nimble as an athlete from his perfect exercise
i don't know how to say good bye to you nell he told dorothy and m next morning
oh that will be splendid declared nan
youre quite rich now aren't you remarked dorothy
and dorothy went up and down the room wipe the pictures of cinderella's proud sisters
and we will be on hand thank you replied the joking dorothy
come nelly called missus mc gluck lan i'm ready where's your hat
we might be able to manage that too nelly told him
my uncle is a fireman and he can take us through his engine house
most of them i guess answered burg
well we have had a good vacation and i'm willing to go to work again
so am i declared man vacation was just long enough i think
mister bobbsey was down from the city of course to take the family home and now all hands even freddy and flossy were busy packing up
there were the shells to be looked after the fish nuts besides downy the duck and snooks the cat
and so our little friends had spent all their vacation
his characters get john gorget mad with jealousy or falling epileptic fits all rave hysterically
if dostoevsky had had last vision he would have been stringer
like them he is a novelist of torture
certainly the last of cruelty the lasted destruction the destruction's sake is the most conspicuous of the deadly sins in dusty sky's men and women
he may not be a cruel author
but they are never in balance they are always in demoniac or conflict
even the last is never hardly ever the lust of a more or less sane man
dostoevsky could not have described the son of nekhludoff in resurrection
this is a madhouse cries someone insidious
one result at this is a multiplicity of action
even the talk is of actions more than o ideas
he saws violent deeds not with the hand but with the suck
but one had noticed during this last two days that the other was wearing a silver watch on a yellow bead chain which he seems not to have seen only before
he took a knife and when his friend had turned away he approached him cautiously from behind took aim turned his eyes heavenwards crossed himself and praying fervently god forgive me for crow's sake
he never paints every man he always projects dostoevsky or a nightmare dostoevsky
that is why crime and punishment belongs to a lower range of fiction than any karenina or fathers and sirs
we sympathize indeed with the fears the bravado the despair that succeed the crime
he is a grotesque made alive by sheer imaginative intensity in passion
one does not grudge an artists abnormal character or two
he invent vicious greatest as dickens events comic greatest
was very fond of hanging cuts and burying them with great ceremony
as for the taramis of themselves he betrays the old father and the eldest of his sons hating each other in fighting like brutal maniacs
serve him right shouted dmitri breathlessly
if i haven't killed him i'll come again and kill him
it is easy to see why dostoevsky has become a popular author
no melodramatic ever poured out incident upon the stage from such a horn of plenty
dost asks always ready to show them all in at once
on two opposite pages of the idiot one finds the following characters brought in by name general punching prince s adele da ivanovna lizaveta procopius nana genie pavlovitch r dons ky princess berquin ski a glare prince miskin coil volga ippolit valuer fern kostya philipovna nina alexandrovna guna tristan and general e volga
but the secret of dost sky's appeal is something more than the multitude in thrill of his incidents and characters
mister murray ball did faces of difficulty and attempts to definition
to him dock iss work is the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life it is more than a record of a struggle it is the struggle itself
and those voices take shape in certain unforgettable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly mean tavern certain surrounding darkness
ultimately they are the creations not of a man who desired to be but of a spirit which sought to know
because they have possessed they are no longer men and women
this is all in a measure true
to say this is not to deny the spirit of content of dusts iss work the anguish of the imprisoned souls at battles with doubt and denial and despair
there is in dostoevsky a suggestion of caliban trying to discover some better god than sir tables
the ultimate attitude of dostoevsky is as christian as the apostle peters lord i believe helped down my unbelief
and beyond the dark night of suffering and dissipating the night gusts is still seized a light of christian compassion
or even by the compassion of others like prince miskin in the idiot
his work like his face bears the mark of this terrible conflict
the novels of the perfect image of the man
as to the man himself the vicomte devour gay described him as he saw him in the last years of his life
when he became excited on a certain point one could have sworn that one had seen him before seated i mention a police court awaiting trial or among vagabonds who passed their time begging before the prison doors
at all other times he carried that look of sad and gentle meekness seen on the images of old savant saints
that the portrait of the men one sees behind dostoevsky's novels the portrait one might almost have inferred from the novels
it is a figure that at once fascinates and repels
he is not by temperament to singer
his music is a still small vest unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and storm
truth to tell mister hardy is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet
he does not express life easily in beautiful words or in images
thus he writes in i found her out there of one who
there could not be an ugly and more prosaic saturation this contained in the ira in the last line
and prose in juries in the choice of words as well as in images
take for example the use of the word domiciled in the passage in the same palm about
when we strangers sought their catering care veiled smiles bespoke their thought of what we were
kater in care is an appalling phrase
is a line of good poetry
you did not come and marching time drew on and warm me numb yet lost for loss of your dear presence there than that i thus found lacking in your make that higher compassion which can overbear reluctance for pure loving kindness sake grieve d when is the ho bower stroked it some you did not come
there are hints of the grand style of lyric poetry in these lines but fraser's lurk in your make and as the hope hour stroked it some are discords the bread tumbling to the levels of victorian commonplace
he has a temperament sensitive beyond that of all but a few recent writers to the pain and passion of human beings
one can remember palm after poem of his with a theme that might easily observed for mister hardy too late christina the lost mistress the last ride together the statue in the bust to name a few
but what a sense of child there is in brownie's tragedy
his wor is a place of opulence not a poverty
to have loved in for an hour is with browning to live forever after in the inheritance of a mighty achievement
to have loved for an hour is in mister hardy's imagination to have deepened the sadness even more than the beauty of one's memories
for then i u distressed by hearts growing cold for me could lonely wait my endless rest me equanimity
but time to make me grieve part steals let's part abide and shakes this fragile frame at eaves with throbbings of me tide
and despair is by no means triumphant in what is perhaps the most attractive of all mister hardy poems the oxen
we pictured the meek wild creatures where they dwelt in their jury pen nor did it occur to one of us there to doubt over kneeling them
the murder faith however or rather of delight in the memory of fief is not mister hardy's prevailing mood
he can enter upon a wall without ironic good darts as we see in the song men who march away
how long he cries in a poem written some years ago
when shall the sen as softer policies whereof we dream have sway in each proud land and patriotism grown god lack scorn to stand bon slave to realms but circle earth and seeds
but perhaps his characteristic attitude to wars to be found not in lines like these but in that melancholy poem the souls of the slain in which the souls of the dead soldiers returned to their country in question as senior sol flame was to have their friends and realities have kept their doughty deeds in remembrance
and general hell hold out her sweethearts sworn royal as doves
some fickle and fleet hearts have found in new loves
and our wives quite another resignedly dry on our deeds
mister hardy has tree bitter a sensuality to believe much in the glory of war
the farewell to mister hardy is the world of ancient human things in which war has come to be a hideous irrelevance
it may be thought on the other hand that mister hardy's poems about war are no more expressive of tragic futility than his poems about love
futility and frustration are ever recalling themes in both
his lovers love his soldiers wrought in the grey defeated of their glory
lovers are always severed both in life and in death
in beyond the last lamp we have the same mournful cry over severance
no shade of pinnacle or tree or tower while earth e jaws will fall in my mound and within the hour still unto yours one wa haunt are two green coverts
they bring his face to face with an experience intenser that our own
nothing of tiniest worth have i wrought pondered planned no one thing asking blame or praise since the pale corpse like birth of this diurnal unit bearing blanks in all its rays dullest of dull hued days

doris dreamed of prejudices all that night and dont about them all the next day
so it must be confessed did penelope though she would not have ad might it it for the world
she knew that penelope had started out to say a new dress
dorry's hunter i believe it's an old quitted

i don't see it's beauty said penelope we've agreed
it may have been pretty once but it is all faded now

it was very kind of aunt adela to send it said doris dutifully
white the wrong side is ever so much prettier than the right is great panoply
what lovely old tiny stuff at knot a beat fated
i declare it is as good as new
well let us go and have tea said penelope i decidedly hungry
besides i see the power toy poplar coming
it is something to passes an hand loon after all
pope was surprised as much as the tender sisterly heard could wish when doris flashed out upon her threw fitly and the evening on the party with the black skirt nicely press and re hung and the prettiest wast imaginable a wast that was a positive creation of dainty rose prickled silk with a girdle and knots of black velvet
so par lope went to blinds party and her dress was admiration of every glen
when ill be told her altogether charming
she looks us if she had just stepped out of the frame of some lovely old picture she said to herself
my out adela gave me give us there material she stammered
i'm named after her missus fair weather suddenly put her arm about penelope and ruth the young girl to her her lovely old face aglow with delight and tenderness
then you are my grand knees she said
when i saw your trice i felt sure you were related to her i should recognise that rosebud seal if i came across it in tibet
penelope was four years older than i was but we were devoted to each other
soon after these our mother died and our house called was broken up
my dear i am a very lonely old woman with nobody belonging to me
now she pattered missus fare weathers soft old hand affectionately
doris and penelope found their leaves and plans changed in the twin cling of an eye
where missus farewell had gone door is't penelope looked at each other
as she slipped into her blue brained afternoon trice her aunt called to her frown billow
aunt jane was standing at the fold of the stairs with a lamp in one hand and the year old baby clanging to the other
she was a big shapeless woman with a round good natured face cheerful and father as a sunflower was aunt jane at all times and occasions
i want to run over and see how missus biggs big e this evening city and you must take care of the baby till i get back
seeing side and went downstairs
all her days were alike as far as hard work and dulness went but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly
but she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter
the room was more and their box about the kitchen which sid they char with two small cousins
her bed and the cot worthy little girl slept filled up almost all the available space
just the bad particular anger one eye appeared to be as large as an orange while the other was the size of a peons exert from ear to ear
sydney hated that mirrors very lightly as she could hate anything
her mother had died to day after and sydney there upon had come into the hands of gold aunt jane with those boats fore held dorry since nothing else was left after the expanses of the double funeral had been failed
presently she began to why with a flush of real excitement on her face
only one answer came to evan douglas and that was forwarded to herb the long suffering a detour of the maple leaf
he wrote that although his age d birth him from membership in the club he was plenty and a limit was eighteen he read the letters of the department with much interest and often had thought of answering some of the request for crespo debs
he never had done so but ellen doubtless sirs letter was so it resting that he had decided to write to her
would she be king enough to correspond with him
he was two years out from the east and had not yet forgotten to be hal sick at times
sydney like the letter and award it
she never expected to meet john lincoln nor did she wished to do so
in the corresponds itself she found her pleasure
joining congal breezy accounts of range life and adventures on the far western plains so anian and mode from snow humdrum plain field life that seemly always had the sensation of crossing the gulf when she opened a letter from the bar and as forced may's own letter this is the way it read as she wrote it
the evergreens pain field dear mister lincoln
i love life and its bloom and brilliancy a love meeting new people i love the reole of mus the harm of laughter and conversation
the men i had been talking it was all more the great numbers
as it was i had contradicted him twice and he had laughed and liked it but his both will always have a new meaning to me henceforth through the inside he himself has given me
it is such meetings at these that give life its sparkle for me

oh seeming two out her hands in a burst of patient protest
no and you never will understand i can't like you understand
everything i told you about it and my life was just imagination
then why did you write then he asked blankly
why did you deceive me
oh i didn't mean to disease you i never thought of such a thing
i just couldn't wite you about my life here not because it was hard but it was so ugly and empty
and when once i had begun i had to keep it up

the piece of cambrai was called the lady's peace in honour the two princesses who had got it though morally different in a very unequal worth they both had minds of a rare order and trained to recognize political necessities and not to attempt any but possible successes

it was cars lasso de lava the prince of spanish poesy the spanish petrarch according to his fellow countrymen
mom fancy signed a similar one for piedmont
they all repaired together to the house prepared for their reception and after dinner the emperors being tired lay down to rest on a couch queen eleanor before long went and tapped at his door and sent word to the king that the emperor was awake
frances with the cardinal de lorraine and the constable the memory soon arrived
on entering the chamber he found the emperor still lying down and chatting with his sister queen who was seated beside him on a chair
yes said charles i had made such cheer that i was obliged to sleep it off
frantic did the converse with his own collar
only seven of the attendants remained in the emperor's chamber and there the two sovereigns conversed for an hour after which they moved to the hall where a splendid supper awaited them
the gents pleaded their privilege of not being liable to be taxed without their own consent
orders had been sent everywhere to receive him as kings of france are received on their joyous accession
this sister existed for us no responsibility we each reported dutifully at the roll call of habit and drop back into our blankets with a grateful sigh
i remember the moon sailing a good gate among apparently stationary clouds i recall a deep black shadow lined before distant silvery mountains i glanced over the starved motionless canvases each of which concealed a man the air trembled with the bellman of cattle and the corrals
solely but a moment later the cook's how brought me to consciousness again
three were to care for the rhoda five were to move the straight herd from the corrals to good fee three brim crews were told to brand the calves we had collected in the cut of the afternoon before that's took up about half the men
the wrist were to make a shore drive in a salt grass
we were the only ones who did go afoot however although the crows were not more than two hundred yards as distance
between the upright bars of greasewood we could see the cattle and near the opposite side the men building a fire next defence
we pushed open the wide gate and entered
one stood waiting for them to finish the sheaf of long ja stamping irons in his hand
all the wrists squatted on their hills along the pence smoking cigarettes and chatted together
the first rays of the sun sighted across in one great sweep from the remote mountains
homer wooden the nold count forty john rooting among the cattle
as the loop settled he jerked sharply upward exactly as one would strike to hook a big fish
homer wrapped the rope twice were thrice about the horn and set over in one stripped avoid the tiding line and to preserve the balance
nobody paid any attention to the calf
behind him followed his anxious mother her head swing in from side aside near the fire the horse stopped
the two bull dogs immediately pounce upon the victim
it was promptly forced over on its right side
thus the calf was unable to struggle
when once you have had the wind knocked out of you or a river too broken you cease to think this unnecessarily rough
hot iron yelled one of the bull dogs
marker yelled the other
the brand oppressed the iron smoothly against the flank
perhaps the cat bladed a little lest the heat scorched
the bran showed cherry which is the proper color to indicate due plan and a successful mark
then he knit out a swallow tail in the other
it seems me the great deal of unnecessary twaddle was abroad as to the extreme cruelty of brandon
undoubtedly it is to some extent painful it could some other method of ready identification be devised it might be as well to adopted in preference
inextinguishable laughter fall the sprit of this doctrine through arizona

one of the little animals was but a few months old so the rider did not bother with its hind legs but tosses loop over it's neck
mister frost and bull calf alone in pictorial history shows the attitudes
and then of course there was the gorgeous contrast between all this frantic and uncomprehended excitement and the absolute matter of fact and reputability of horse and rider
as he knew his business and as the calf was a small one the little beast went over promptly bit the ground with the whack and was pounced upon and held
he would catch himself on one foot scrambled vigorously an in by struggling back to the upright
he could imagine what happen next
this is productive of some fond of it fails
but now the brandon wasn't full swing
when the nooses fell they turn and walked toward the fire as a matter of course rarely did the cast fail
men ran to and fro busy and intent
sometimes threw four cabes were on the ground at once
thus aided and dissipated
no more nick calves they announced
then he would spit on his hands and go out it alone
of luck attended his first effort his sorrow chasm was profound there's your little calf said he
would you like to have me toted to you ord do you reckon you could toddle this far with your little old iron
toward noon the work select
finally homer rode over to the cattleman and reported the brand and finished
the latter counted the marks in his tally book

the markers squatted on their heels told over the bits of ears they had saved

he was ling on aside those black eyes of his blazon of me but now both of them saw the same distance

i stood after a larger party
he strongly opposed this as depreciating the shares but i had no intention of going alone into what was then considered a wild and dangerous country finally we compromised
a third of the treasure was to go to him a third to me and the rest was to be divided among the man whom i should select his scheme did not appeal to him

ruby gillis thinks of nothing but boughs said anne disdainfully

this was how the story club came into existence
n boys were allowed in it although rheum gules of pine that their admission would make it more exciting and each member had to produce one story a week
each girl has to read her story out loud and then we talk it over
mine is rosamond mont mor cory all the girls you pretty bow
i'm sure that must have a wholesome effect
the more was the great thing mister een says so
i read one of my stories to him and missus allen and they both agree that the moral was excellent
jane and ruby almost always cry when i come to the pathetic parts
miss josephine berry wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life
i'm sure missus allen was never such a silly forgetful little girl as you are
i felt so encouraged when i heard that
missus lynde's has she always filled shocked when two years of anyone ever having been naughty no matter how small they were
now i wouldn't have felt that way
vanity and vexation of spirit
the spring was abroad in the land and marilla's sober middle aged step was slighter and swifter because of its deep primal gladness
i must say with all her thoughts i never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and i'm real sorry to find her so now
perhaps you're judging her too hastily marilla
of course i knew you'd take her part matthew but i'm bring youre up not you

anne cowered deeper into her pillows as if desirous of hiding herself ever from mortal eyes no

anne shirley didn't you know it was wicked thing to do
yes i knew it was a little wicked admitted anne

but i haven't been and i believed every word he said implicitly
who said h you tiding about
oh i didn't let him in the house
in a trice i saw myself with beautiful rave and black hair and the temptation was irresistible
oh marilla but a tangled web we weave when first we practise to to see
you he must be cut off there is no other way you can't go out with it looking like that
with a dismal sigh she went for the scissors
but there was nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you've died a dreadful color is there
i'm going to weep all the time you're cutting it off if it wanted a fear
it seems such a tragically
anne wept then but laider arm when she went upstairs and looked in the glass she was calm with despair
yes i will to the
i never thought i was vain about my hair of all things but now i know i was in spite of its being red because it was so long and thick and curly
i expect something how will happen to my nose next
anne's clip tad made a sensation in school in the following monday but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it not even josie pye who however did not fail to inform anne that she looked like a perfect scarecrow

they had often gone down like this and the thing could be more convenient for playing away
the black shell having been procured anne spaded over the flat and then lay down on the bottom with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast
it smiles the effect because this is hundreds of years before missus lynde was borne

jane rested the occasion
though behind the landing
anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard she was white the lips but she did not lose her self possession

for whether in that state men would have been master of a man
therefore in the state of innocence man had no mastership of the animals
therefore in the state of innocence before men had its spade nothing dis bated that was naturally subject to him
secondly disapproved by the other of divine providence which hus governs in theoria things by the superior
certainly this is proved from a property m and father animals
now whatever is part is pated is subjected what is essential and universal
therefore a subjection of other animals to man is prop to be natural
they would now hither on this kind have been accepted from the mastership of men as neither at present nor day for their reason accepted from the mastership of god whose providence has ordained others
this is signified by the fact that god let the animals to men that he might give the names expressive their respected natures
so all animals would have a bit men of their own court as in the present day some domestic animals obey him
objection one it was seen that in safes m would not have had mastership over all other creatures
much last therefore would they have a bed man in the state of the misters
therefore since it is by this reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems fitting the state lin sinse man had have been in over plans
now am reason has the position the master and not of a subject
i answer that we must needs admit that in a primitive state they would have been some inequality at least as regard sex because generation depends upon diversity sex and likewise as regards age for some would have been born of others nor would sech a une have been sterile
there might also have been bodily disparity
the quality myles will rise on the parts of nature as bove described without any defect of nature
objection one he will sin that in the staten sense man would not happy mast over men
therefore in a state of innocence now not have been subjected man
in other sense mastership is referred in a general sends to ane kan of subject and in this sense even pay has the office of governing and directing freemen can be caught a master
such a kind of mastership would have existed in the stances between man and men for two reasons
but in the state of innocence they would have been lowliness of age
on the contrary everything generated questing perfect but in the state of innocence children have been begot by generation
therefore from the first they would happen in perfect in bodingly size and power
therefore in the state of innocence there was no need for women to be borne on the contrary nature's possessing generation that happy in harmony with never in which it was established by god
i have been told that mister van brandt is imprison for debt i said
and i saw for myself last night that he had left you hopeless
he left me the little money he had with him when he was arrested she rejoined sadly
tis cruel creditors and more to blend th he is for the poverty that has fallen on us
even this negative defensive v brandt stung me to the quick i ought to have spoken more guardedly of him i said bitterly
i ought to have remembered that a woman can forgive almost any wrong than a man can inflict on her when he is a man whom she loves
she put her hand on my mouth and stop me before i could say any more
how can you speak so cruelly to me she asked
you know to my shame i confessed it to you the last time we met you know that my heart in secret is all yours
what wrong are you talking of
is it the wrong i suffered when dan brant married meat with a wife living at the time and living still
do you think i can ever forget the great misfortune of my life the misfortune that has made me unworthy of you
it is no fault of mine god knows but it is not the less true that i am not married and that the little darling who is playing out there with her doll as my child
and you talk of my being your wife knowing that the child accepts me as her second father i said
it would be better and happier for us both if you had as little pride as a child pride she repeated
in such a position as mine
a helpless woman with a mock husband in prison for debt
am i to marry you for my food and shelter
am i to marry you because there is no lawful tie that binds me to the father of my child
that is he is he is not forsaken me he has been forced away
my only friend is it possible that you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife
the woman in my situation must be heartless indeed who could destroy your place in the estimation of the world in the regard of your friends
though wretchedest creature that walks the streets which shrink from treating you in that way
o what are men made of
how can you how can you speak of it
i yielded and spoke of it no more
every word she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom i had loved and lost
bitterly as i hated the man who had parted us i loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake hopeless infatuation
i don't deny it i don't excuse it hopeless infatuation you have forgiven me i said
let me deserve to be forgiven
it is something to be your only friend
you must have plans for the future tell me unreservedly how i can help you
complete the good work that you have the gun she answered gratefully help me back the health
make me strong enough to submit to a doctor's estimate of my chance of living for some years yet
a doctor's estimate of your chances of living i repeated what do you mean
i hardly know how to tell you she said without speaking again of mister van brandt
do speaking of him again nan speaking of his debts i asked
why did you hesitate
you know that there is nothing i will not do to relieve your anxiety
never let me tell you the plain truth
there is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison
yes this is his position in two words a little while sinse he obtained an excellent offer of employment abroad from a rich relative of his and he had made all his arrangements to accept it
unhappily he returned to tell me of his good fortune and the same day he was arrested for debt
this mirror that had been set for her was plainly revealed in those forewords
in the eye of the loss she was of course a single woman she was of age she was to all intent and purposes her own mistress
what was there to prevent her from insuring her life if she pleased and from so disposing of the insurance as to give vampa a direct interest in her death
thanks to the happy exeter of my position the one certain way of protecting her lay easily within my reach
i could offer to lend the scoundrel the money that he wanted at an hour's notice and he was a man to accept my proposal quite as easily as i could make it
you are quite mistaken i replied
i am only doubting whether your plan for relieving mister van bent of his embarrassments is quite as simple as you suppose
are you aware as a delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to borrow money in ther policy of insurance
i know nothing about it she said sadly
will you let me ask advice at my lawyers
they are trustworthy unexperienced men and i am sure they can be abused to you
cautiously as i had expressed myself her delicacy took the alarm
promise that you won't ask me to borrow money of you for mister van branch she rejoined and i will accept to help gratefully
i could honestly promise that
my one chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge to course that i had now determined to pursue
i rose to go while my resolution still sustained me
kiss me she whispered before you go
it is only your goodness that overpowers me
the next day everybody in the house began to make preparations with the journey
everything was done very leisurely though there was a lot of talking and disputing and the giving of contrary orders
the old porter was there directing escorting the sermons as they piled the rugs and blankets and bags of food and pots and pans and dishes into the wagon
there was quite a procession when that last the big wagon rumbled out through the gateway
behind i came to grandmother and her dewy deck a suitable litter or easy chair some between two long poles
besides the family there were many servants and several others walked beside a slow moving wagon
the cook too while with them
good bye shouted little of miss garden wala went by good bye
they shouted greeting tor their friend the potter as they passed them and also to the old factor sneered over with ashes who sat in a little brick hut by the bridge and pretended to make wonderful cures
this is more fun they going to school said color as the oxen plodded along through clouds of dust
these lovely birds are family everywhere in india and in some parts run quite wild
his long matted hair hung on his shoulders and he singing his prayers with the help of a rosary of beads which he continually passed through his hands
as the wagon came up a young man who accompanied the holy man ran up and held out a begging bull saying give o charitable people to this holy one
no country in the world has so many beggars as india
many of them are caught holy men because they do nothing but make pilgrimages from one sacre place to another living solely on the arms that are given to them
when they had eaten their lunch the young people went to explore the garden near them
perhaps they dogs said nahua a little fearfully but they forgot about dogs and they saw a thicket of sugar king down by his stream
perhaps and can buy some from the man there he is now plowing by the stream said hola
it is the giver water said the farmer as he took a lost stuck of cane and gently guided it down to the stream
the snake is another sacred animal of the hindu and they will not kill or injure when for anything

behind the how does that a servant holding a big umbrella a fond feathers over the raja ass head
the driver sat on the neck of the elephant and guided the big beast at their crowding him on one side or the other with an iron shod stick or gold

n these of the day the little folk talked of nothing but the great regions escort
our party came to a halt among many other block carts the owners of which were already sitting around on the ground cooking their suppers or bargaining the fut at a little booth
these they used for plight heaping them up with their boiled rice and curry and search and our stores as puddings and sweets
a supper was being eaten another parties thought that the parrel encamped enough far away
when the little was put down the young boy stepped out looking very proud and haughty
his servants al went spread a handsome rug in the ground for him to sit on and rushed about waiting on him taking good care to keep everyone under distant
yes and how he orders everyone about him
around a little bowman's neck was a thin quarter thread which was the sign of his high cast
meanwhile the haughty little gammon ate his supper when his head turned away so no one could see him eat and then growing tired of respectful glasses of the crowd around him he got into his litter again and the servants fastened the curtains tightly around him
everybody said soundly in spite of the fact that one of the servants was beating a drums of the night which they really believed with the way to keep off evil spirits
oh the thieves he cried
they as bad as the beggars

the days glided by with the stiffness and crisp bees numbs growing thus painful and the pony recovering fast for the clear mountaineer seemed to act like a cure for wounds
every day that came showed the indian animal in better condition
as efforts to move the longer made chrysolite his own pains in those he fell at seeing the must and suffer
everyone was busy for the keeping watch regularly took up a good deal of time
it's our nonsense ned cried kas for them to think that they're staying on account of us hullo griggs were you listening
how did your pony go this morning splendid
just hearted a little on the bad leg but is better than always yesterday
did you candid this morning canter
we want at a good swinging gallop and what about you
oh i'm only little stiff still
we shall get straw more quickly journey over the plains or clary in and now among the mountains
he says we're d start to morrow at daybreak
hurrah cried kiss
but we shan't my lad why not
basin indians again
oh you're always seen indians again
while they show themselves to me i didn't want them said griggs dryly
d artful lot never been away at all i believes
we couldn't see em well fere made to start they had been close upon o heels directly
ah you have to trap moo chris said nan maliciously
look here you say out again we shall quarrel hear that gigs
oh yes i hear sylvie right
if you can't show us a better way he had better hold her tom
very well i can do that said ned hartly
there that's enough cried chris don't be so petty ned
that's right cut goods
look here lad of just being trying that place again
and he timed the doctor likes
being shot at thy fellows with bow and arrow sounds bad enough but there's not much risk here
i don't know about that said chris anxiously
don't you well i do
i should be any fast and dodging in and out among the rocks and cheese
but envy you won't be staying still continued griggs
don't believe there's a bit a risk for me i shall be all right
but animals will be well back in that hall said chris
yes my lad but' want them to be planted forth backs fille
i'm afraid father would say that the ponies ought to be close at hand
yes that's s right as it can be done but it'll go hard with us all as the indians gave up the bay of the trap and turn upon those who said it
well you must talk it a rue father said chris
to many redskins about as i told you
there're always too many red skins about cried chris impatiently
i wish you could charge them boldly ascend them flying over the plains
never to come back again said ned sharply
not quite my lads don't you see that were playing of every ticklish game
just then the doctor cameo the shelter with a boy having talking bringing with them walton lovely shooting or rather trying to shoot for he had had no success and they two were talking earnestly about ways ands
i'll hear your briggs c the doctor
had a good turn as scouting yes sir
the indians have shifted the quarters and they in balas award a position as we could contrives our purpose
we must get aways on her to some good hunting ground
to the indian sing to be camping or only on the moves
this seemed to me to be hatching up some dodger another replied books
then he began to walk up and down slowly evidently deep in thought
there he said as made of th mind
it is very evident that we may wait he return stores exhausted and be as far off the opportunity we seek ass eard
the indians can wait we cannot and they seem to know it
going to give up young chris's clan said grig spy
no i'm going to put it in force out once we start tonight
for all the same we can be making our preparations
the barrels can be flooded with water and everyone's bottle
provisions can be paps in nur ballets in fact everything how ready for a start
finally just at dusk the atoms could be driven for flute and water and
exactly replied the doctor
but before any more sent griggs i want to offer you the opportunity to drop back
well for said goop strut
not a bit of it sir i'm going to take care they don't hid me
i wing to do a bit to carry out young chris's plan i shut up the ruskin for a week or tre perhaps a monthly get right away
theres a horrible situ griggs
would be as we let e get a better for us sir
we mean the shutting up the enemy here to stars
the jacketed griggs so sharply that the boy started stays them right if they did sir
what business have they to want our sculp but we should have shed them up to five
they'd have weeks of work before they could get their horses out but without horses they'd be out in the wake
starve nonsense
but there i don't want to make speeches it's our settle gentlemen
well you've got to tell the lookout with coming off
now everyone understand that he is to be ready without showing any wasatch foot in din scout that there is something on the way
and again when the artists following malicorne advice a little late in arriving and when saint agnan had been obliged to be absent for some time it was interesting to observe though no one witnessed them those moments a silence full of deep expression which united in one side two souls most disposed to understand each other and who by no means objected to the quite meditation enjoyed together
in a word malicorne philosopher that he was though he knew it not had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in amidst of play and with desire in the assurance of possession
in this manner therefore without leaving her room and having no confidant she was able to return to her apartment thus removing by her appearance a little tardy perhaps the suspicions of the most determined sceptic
but the door remained close and neither saint agnan nor the painter appeared nor did the hangs even move
gould and dearest love said the king return quickly
no no not today sire
i knew but too well that you had not ceased to love me
the valerie with a gesture partly of extreme terror and partly as if invoking a blessing attempted to speak but cannot articulate one word
at the moment however when the king threw himself on his knees a cry of utter despair rang through the corridor accompanied by the sound of retreating footsteps
the captain sitting buried in his leather armchair his spurs fixed in the floor his sword between his legs was reading a number of letters as he twist his moustache
d'artagnan uttered a welcome full of pleasure when he perceived his friend's son
well my boy he said by what a lucky incident does it happen that the king has recalled you
these words did not sound agreeably in the young man's ears who as he seated himself replying upon my word i cannot tell you all that i knows i have come back hum
that the king has not recalled you and you have returned
i did not understand that at all
raoul was already pale enough and he now began to turn his hat round and round in his hand
what they does is the matters that you look as you do and what makes you so dumb
said the captain do people nowadays assume that sort of heirs in england
i have been in england and came here again as lively as a chaffing
but you not say something
i have to much to say
ah how is your father
forgive me my dear friend i was going to excuse that
d'artagnan increased his sharpness of his penetrating gaze which no secret was capable resisting
you are happy about something he said
i am indeed and you know the reason very well monsieur d'artagnan
nay d not pretend to the astonish
i am not pretending to be astonished my friend
i have neither head nor arm do not despise but help me ino words i am the most wretched of living beings oh
she is deceiving ill said d'artagnan not a muscle of whose face had moved those are big words who makes use of them
everyone ah
if everyone says so there must be some truth in it
not for a friend for a son
i do take it you are really ill from curiosity
no it is not from curiosity is is from love
cut another big word
i tell you i love louise to distraction
well suppose it were only that
no sensible man ever succeeded in making much of a brain when the head was turned
i have completely lost my senses in the same way a hundred times in my life
you would hear but you would not understand me you would understand but you would not obey me
oll try tie
i go far even if i were unfortunate enough to know something and foolish enough to communicate it to you you are my friend you say indeed yes
very good i should quarrel with you
i never complain as you know but as heaven and my father would never forgive me for blowing out my brain i will go and get the first person i meet to give me the information which you withhold i will tell him he lies and and you l killum
and a fine affair that would be so much the better what should i care
you now assume a different ton instead of killing you will get killed yourself i suppose you mean very fine indeed
how much i should regret you
of course i shall go about all day saying ah
what a fine stupid fellow that brag alone was
as great as stupid as i ever met with
go then groan go and get yourself disposed of if you like
i hardly knew who can have taught you logic but de take me if your father has not been regularly robbed of his money
will buried it facing his hands murmuring no no i have not a single friend in me world
i don't fancies monsieur i do not laugh at you though i am a gascon
a carpenter what do you mean
upon my word i did not know someone told me there was a carpenter who made an opening through a certain floor
why don't know where
in whose room m
i have told you for the last hour that i know nothing of the whole affair
but the painter then de portrait
while you see to him only that name in your mouth
i do that suppose it will concern you
yes you're right and he made a step or two as if he were going to leap wh are you going
to love for someone who attend me be true
who is that a woman
you wish to be consoled by someone and you will be so at once she will tell you nothing il herself of course so be off
you are mistaken monsieur replied raoul the woman i mean will tell me all the evil she possibly can
well i admit it
and in point of fact why should i play with you as a cat does with the poor mouth
you distress me you do indeed
wait if you can
i could not so much due worse
ay said raoul snatching eagerly at the pen which the captain held out to him
how very fortunate that is he was looking for you too
she said in the same tone of voice it is not i who am going to speak to him oh then
