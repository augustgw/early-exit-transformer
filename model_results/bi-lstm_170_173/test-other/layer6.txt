margaret said mister hale as he returned from shown his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thornton made his confession of having been as shopboy
you don't mean that you thought me so silly
i really like that account of himself bet than anything else he said
his statement of having been a shopboy was the thing i like best the wall
you who were always accusing people of being shop he at helstone
i don't think mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some part of what he said
his father dying in miserable circumstances
why it might have bring in the world house
his father's speculated wildly failed and then kill himself because he could not bet the disgrace
all his formal friends sharped from the discloses that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
no one came forwards to help the mother and this boy
at least no friend came forward immediately and mister thornton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
so they lift milton
how tainted asked of other
op paa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
and the poor men around him there were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of be sympathies because they had not his ion nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
not vicious he never said that
improvident and self indulgent were his words
margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include little annoyance
however out it came
papa i do think mister thornton a very remarkable man but purse me i don't liking at all
i do said her father laughing
personally as you call it and all
i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
but good night child
there was several other science of something wrong about missus hale
she had dixon held mysterious consultations in a bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was a custom when any distress of her mistress called up on her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chambers soon after dixon lifted and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
but though she received presses and f words back again in touch profusion as would have glad in her formerly yet she felt but there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
she lay wet very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
a servant give dixon permanent resistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attention she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
visiting register officers seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she met bessy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
well busy howe you
better' not better if you know what that means
br exactly replied margaret smiling
i'm better in not being torn to pieces by coughing the nights but' weary and tired or milton and longing to get away to the landa ba and when i think i'm farther and farther off o heart sinks none no better i'm worse
margaret turned round to walk gong side of the girl in her feeble progress homeward
but for a mineral two she did not speak
at last she said in a low voice
missy dish to die
bessy was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
not worse than any others i reckon
but what was it
you know i'm a stranger here sir perhaps i'm not so quick at um standing what you mean as if if i'd lived all my life in milton
i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly
i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful lye as she mit margaret's soft and friendly gazed
as they turned up into a small court opening out into a scold street betty said
you will not be daunted de fathers at home and speaks bit graf fish at first
but nicholas was not at home when they entered
past bessie at last
bessy took a long and feverish draught and then fill back and shut her eyes
margaret bent ogre and said bessy don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or may have been
remember who gave it to you and made what it is
now i will not have my wench preach to
but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of laugh it was to be
i believe where i see and no more
that's what i believe young woman
i don't believe all a hear no not by big deal
but whose come at last and whose welcome as long as who will keep them preaching on what who knows not about
its simple are not far to fetch nor h to work
but the gol and he played the more was margaret
tiring hardly onion is a good man hes
i sometimes think i shall be merk with sorrow even in the city of god if father is not there
her feverish collo came into a cheeks and the feverish flame into a eye
but you'll be there father you shall oh my hot
she put herr to it and became ghastly pale
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest won her bosom
presently the spasm that fore shuddered death had passed away and bie roused her soft and said
i'll go to bed it's best place but catching that margaret's gar you'll come again i know you will but just say it
i will come to morrow said margaret
margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
she was late for tea at home

perhaps she m have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
she sounded to be such careful economical person that i should like any one out off the same family

nor was it sunday on which they took a rest and rushed their shirts according to mister beard's rule of life
they did not stay there but walked out across the dance with the skylights were singing and on a dip of the downs came upon great stone wards and towers for a strong and grey
what spat there said dickie
replied he of a truth i heard him not and i wat him not and folks are all sleeping
but she said whomsoever thought cas awake he's the reciter
then said the eunuch ar thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him
rejoined the eunuch who then was the reciter point him out to me
by allah replied the fireman i tell thee the truth
tell me what happened what's l mc kan
what ails thee then that thou must needs reside verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the foger asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
and he os improvised the two following this stitch
when you sought al zaman heard the thirsting provis she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their will home then she wept and cried to the eunuch and said to him w to thee
he who recited the first time hath recited the second time and i heard him hard by
by allah and thou fetching not to me i will assuredly roused the chamberlain on thee and y shall be thee and cast thee out
but take these hundred dinas and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt
returned quickly and linger not
when it was the seventy third nine
but the yok said i will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returning into my lady without him
now when the fireman heard these words he feared for tha machan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the unit by allah it was not i and they know him not
so go thou to thy station and if thou agave me any one after this hour reciting ought of paltry whether he be near or far it will be e or some one i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me
then he kissed the oo's head and spake him fare till he went away but the castrato fetched the around and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
i say what made my ignominy what have the beater cup i train far be from me that lamb to flee nor will i bow to those who blame and for such law would deal me shame
then said the eunuch to z machan be me would be o my lord
o my lord continued the eunuch and shahrazad perceived that the dawn of day and seized to say her permitted say
we will do thee know aright o my son nor wrong thee in ought but our objects is that thou ben th gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and returning meal and safety and thou shall have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news
then the eunuch went out to z machan and said to him reside what verses thou knowest for my ladies here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition
and also these
then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the tway fell down in a fainting fit
when the eunuchs saw these case he wandered that them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
after a while they came to themselves and whose out al zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression laud her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the kun and what had appened to her with the bai how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother shark and and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of b how he had made their marriage contract with her and had gone ino her and how the king their sire had sent and asked for her from charan
but now go to thy master and ree him quickly to me
the chamberlain call castrato and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i here an i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the talker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girding his ass and preparing for flight
she said it hath reached me auspicious king that when the stalk or girted is ass for plied and bes take himself saying oh would i knew what is become of him
i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence dis pages at about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime
why didst thou say i never repeated this couplets not that i know who re bated them when it was it th companion
but now i will not leave thee between this place and that doubt and what betideth thy comrade shall be ti thee
was as i feared the cals discerning but on to allah we are all returning
then the eunuch cried upon you the pages saying take him off the ass
and he answered a am the chamberlain of the amir of the masks king shorten sang of amar bein d woman lowed bac dad and of the land of kor son and a bring tribute and presence from him to his fathering bad that
so fairy forwards no harm shall befall you till you join his grand wa ear than done
then he bad him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was trembling to the amir of the masks and was bound to king mar with presence and the tribute of syria
so it was agreed that we go to damascus and fetched thence the king's son shark and and may came sultan over his father's rail
and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadat z a machan for quoth they his name be light of the place and he hath a sister news hart uz am hies the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for all he just and none wet what is become of them
so he turned to the wazir dandan and said to him readily your tale is a wonder of wonders
no o chief was ere that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and brings you your desire after the easiest of fashions for let he almighty will restore it to you z a machan and his sister nos al zaman whereby we will settle the matter as with easily can
when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with grey joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the tway and what befell them and the cause of their long absence
zaman can bowed his head a while and then said i accept the position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and sat him on the right way
then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharpen
after a while the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of bagdad and kor son a conquering host like the pool tide sea and chazy perceived the dawn of day and seized say her permitted say
when it was a seventy eighth night
any meat all rejoiced at the a session of the light of the place
lastly the miner went in and kissed the ground before z a machan who rose to meet him saying welcome o was here and sires son speer
mover the sultan commanded his wo event dan call at ten day's halt of the army that he might be private with him and learned from him how and wherefore his father had been slain
he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the the host to halt tim days

the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
sher bin run his eye slow along the crowd and where ever it struck the people tried a little de out gazing but they couldn't they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky

so then the ring master he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could s stay on the horse
it warn't funny to me though i was all a trembled to seize danger

now hustle back right off and fetch the duke gub here and the new carpet bags
so then they waited for a steamboat
but the king was car he says
they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would do tell you
then want of them says kind a soft gentle
phelps as one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look alike
i wit around a climb over the back style by the ash oper and started for the kitchen
i out with a yes ef i thought
so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
when we got there she set me down in a spit bottom chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
well it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt
and i they k he died afterwards he was a baptist
yes it was mortification that was it
your uncles bent up to the town every day to fetch you
you must to met him on the road didn't ogreish man with a
why child it'll be stole
it was kinder thin eyes but i says
i had my mind on the children all a time i wanted to get them out to one side and pumped them a little to find out who i was
pretty soon she made the cold chill streak all down my bite because she says
i see it warn't a bit of us to try to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
so i says to myself here's another place where i got to rest the truth
i opened my mouth to begin but she grab me and hustled me an behind the bed and says hear he comes
children don't you say a word
i see i was in a fix now
missus felt she jumped for him and says
has he come no says you her husband
i can't imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy
uneasy she says i'm ready to go distracted
he must a come and you've missed him along a road
oh don't distress me any more n already distressed
why silas look yonder up the road haint thats somebody coming
the old gentleman stared and says
i hain't no i dare who is it
is tom soyer
being time sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stay easy and comfortable till bind by i here a steamboat coffin along down the river
then i says to myself s'pose time solder comes down on mad boat
but i am hu you please that you have seen my lady
i knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
her conversation has more charms and can be in mere beauty and a humor and disposition would make a deformed person appeal lovely
why did you not send me that youse and a garland
why the best on it is i have a squireen that is its good as in night
in elmers we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish and occasion as i cannot tell which is strangers
all the people that i had ever and my life refuse will brought again up one the stage like richard the third's ghosts to approach me wal and all the kindness discoveries could make i had for you was lid to my charge
my best quantities if i have any that our good served but for aggravations of my fault and i was allowed to have witt and understanding and discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in this
t a strange change and i am very sorry for it but i'll swearing or not had to help it
mister fish is a squire things and has so many mistresses than anybody ne pretend a share in him and be believed though i have the honour to be his near neighbor to speak freely i cannot brag much that he makes any court to me and i know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often
i think my youngest brother comes down of him
i can no sooner give you some little hints where about they live but you know them presently and i meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
but it seems this gentleman is not so easy axis but you ma acknowledge something due to me if i inclined him to l graciously upon you and therefore there is not much home done
i have missed four fits and i had but five and have recovered so much strength as may be ventured to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
god besides i can give you others
i am here much more out of people's way that in town for my aunts in such as pretend and interested me in a power over me do so persecute me let their good nature wille it so ill that they are am not accepted as i would you live in a hollow tree to avoid them
you will think him altered and if it be possible nore melancholy th he was
if marriage agrees nor better with other people than it does with him i shall pray that all my friends may escape it
well in earnest if i were prince that ladies should be my mistress but i can give no rule to anyone else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing your hearts to her may be infinitely taken with one i should not value at all for so ass a justinian wis providence has ordained it that by their different humans everybody might find something to please them starves withal without envying their neighbours
the matter is not gray for confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best please never to be known in it on any occasion whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly avoided one muster dis fy oneself by doing nothing that one need care knows
if i had a picture that will fit for you he should have it
how can in talk of you faring fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you it could
i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am sudden he knows y utmost of the injuries you have received from her
we have had another did beat but much m call me
then besides there was a time when we oursel was were different to on another did i do so then or have i lend it since
i have been studying how on cheek might come by his intelligence and i very believe he has it from my cousin peters
how kindly do i take the civilities of your fathers in earnest you cannot imagine how his let appease me
would it would leave me and then i could be i shall not always have occasion for it
by poor lady vavasor is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against the protector and did not discover it
she has told now all that was told her but vow you will never say from whence she had it we shall see whether her resolutions ez unalterable as those of my lady calash
i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
i ever saw anyone yet that did not look siny and out of countenance whatever knew a wedding well designed but one and that was of two persons were time enough i confess to contrive it and nobody to pleas in and themselves
the truth is i could not endure to be missus bride in a public reading be made the happiest personal earths
do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather and fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
yet in earnest your father will not find my brother pate and wanting and civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters in me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set higher value upon her sister and she deserves
my aunt told me no longer gen yesterday that i was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome t heed
you see i give you th warning

because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than they i did not intended silver i can assure you
i do not find it why am told i was so extremely when i believed you love me
but i am called upon
directed for your master
i see you a cancer when we please then was authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded for a very good principle in me
we d her not that our tongues lie more on one side of our ms and the other for fear of overturning it
you are satisfied i hope at this that i escape drowning
but i am troubled much you should make ill a journey to saw little purpose indeed i writ by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters
how one grim you will be but alas
for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to not decay an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission
they laugh to hear me say that one unkind word and destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase everyday if it will possible but never lessen
you go broad all thee and play all night and see our prayers and get time
well and silver earnest now i would not live theres a twelvemonths to gain all that king has lost unless it were to give it him again
will you be so good nature
he has one son its to finest boy that e you saw and has a noble spirit beget stands in that all his father at one word from him is as much as twenty with things
you must give me leave to entertain you thir with discourses or the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
not to knowing you would come home i can assure you nor for any other kitchen on my own but with a cousin of my that had long designed to make herself sport with him and did not miss of her aim
in my life i never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and noor old woman who passes for a which could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
ever sins this adventure i have had some greater believe in all things for this nature that i could not forbear laying a peas caught with nine peas into under my door yesterday and was informed by it that my husband's name should be thomas how do you like that
she put her hair down turned his girt back put her feet on the fender and took partlet her lap all of which arrangements signified that something very important had got to be thought over and sett
the more propos was the more credit
after righted it unlight it and maybe dis the consequence of that night's fun
just suppose it is true that he does asked me con price i yes
what a spiteful thing i ams
i to so much for au at home how i should him shy that
let me see how can i begin
he has known how all her lives and has a good influence over her
now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed him more than once that weak for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided she missed the blessing little interviews that used to put a certain flavour of romans into her dor hut working days
i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that knows attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence and she suspected
it was that indescribable something which women up wick to see and feeling men who have been pressed the lie and good mothers
this had an especial charm to polly for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to everyone
lately the su changed especially towards parley and it filled her more than she would confess even to herself
at first she tried to think she could but unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even certitude
polly felt a very court your friendship for mister sydney but not one particle of the low feted only kind in which laugh can bully paid
this finished polly's indecision and after that night never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with the spies of the old e in her composition
when sat t came polly started as usual for visit to back he and best but couldna resist stopping at the shores to leave a little pass of a fiend that was calling time
a foolish little speed to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tender hearted girl trying to the duty
take hold of massa charley's hand miss mamy and b pretty like willie and flossy said the maid
at the street corner at like l school poy was parting from a rosy face school girl who music w he was r actively so ing
how he got there was never very clear to pony but there he was flushed and a little out of pet but looking so glad to see her till she had not the hard to biff and cool as she had fully int turned to be when they meant
cheerily could not help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
that is the way i get to the wass answered polly
she did not mean to tell p as fry this was so ega b she forgot herself
but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she choice to mend her forts though she won't own it and who surprised you some day by the mount of hard and sense and goodness she has got
thank you no
lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
asked the out for young man laying a rep into which polly immediately fell
he was quicker to take a hin than she had expected and being booted browed in generous with off to settle the matter at once for pod's sake as pace hiss own
so and you made a last poy and remark he said quietly watching your face keenly all the while i thoughts ba i'm going out of town when business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me anny it
she thought she had a good deal of the coquet in her and i've no doubt that with time and draining she would have become a very dangerous from person but now she was fart trans pound and straightforward by nature evening to tell a white like lively
he was going before she could do any thing but look up at him with a remorse for face and she walked on feeling that the first and paps the only love as she would ever have had read his answer and accepted l in servants
parley did not return to a faith with walk till she learn for miny that uncle had rally left tow and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the ways a pleasant after all
lugging too and for as usual but the news with you
perhaps she chow him
utterly done with and laid upon the shelf
miny the ether day she wished her was a picts she could paddle in the bards and not first above ribs
now don't be affected polly but just tell like a dear has not he proposed
don't you think he means to
truly julie fare
i don't mean to be prying but i will he thought he did
well i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have
i just gave him the hint and he took
he meant to go away before that so them think his heart is broken or mind what city tatler say
he understood and being a gentlman made no fs
but polly it would have been a grand thing for you
i'm not you know i preferred to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days
never mind what the business was it surfaces to say that it was a good beginning for young men like town who hing been born and bread in the most conservative class of the most considered city in near england needed just the healthy hardy social influences of the west to write in his views and make a man of him
fortunately everyone was so busy that the missis sa of perverts that there was no time for romans of any sword and the full young people worked together as soberly insensibly as if all sorts of i notions were not bothered up in the respective hurts
pity that the ends comes as soon but the hour did its work and wend its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind but the young folks did not see it them for their eyes within because of the partings that must be
if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a sum town but sydney of and called then his vacation came and the voluminous clots bonds of polly be guard the long days
tim w at on's av to his mother but the letters were shob satisfactory for men never d toll the interesting little things that women bes like to hear
now i'm only tired had a good dear sod lately and the doll whether makes me chest at roer brew
forgiven polly but i can't up saying it for this there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can
a i not to deceive myself but it does see ass if there was a chance of happiness for me
thank heaven for that
cried polly with the hardier satisfaction in her boys
poor parley was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say
non were needed her tolt her face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion i give foolish boast which and the hundreds are after it
once or tall ee but sor of chokingly and i thought it was only some little flirtation
it was sus with of me not a guess before
it was tender earnest and defiant that fy forgot the defence of her own lover and ignat of polls loyalty to hers for this faithful all ab sobbing laugh was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friend's bast of two what three love as a year and calculate their respective vs c almost as much coolness as the young men discuss the fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to marry
i hope ma bailey's only thing sir she added softly i could not bear to happen disappointed again
said fanny turning hopeful all at once
support i say a word to tom just inquired after his heart in a gal away you know and' giving the chance to tell mee theres anything deter
bear it people always to bear things somehow answered polly looking as if slains have beene passed upon her
it was a very different winder from the last bove the girls
if fy wanted to show him what she could do towards making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded bad than she suspected for spite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mister sydney at least for he was more the house friend than ever and seemed determined approve the change of fortune made not difference to him
she kept much at home when the day's work was done finding it pleasantly to se streaming of a book or sewing alone than to exert herself even to go to the shores
polly was not at all like herself that winder and those nears to her saw invented edit most
for n was so absorbed in business that he ex noted a whole baily question and left them in other darkness
fy came broking in upon one day looking as if she poor tidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them
but if work baskets were giv it with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any belt
she had even been in society before the revolution
it was her pleasure and her vanity dragon these names on every pretext
every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monseigneur saint fr sis gave it to must signor say julian maso saint julian gave it to monsignor saint juss master yur saint your sents gave it to monsieur said procopius et cater et cetera
and the schoolgirls were begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under the bales charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers from
it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
the rule of font val did not forbid this
she would not show the subject tow anyone
thus it furnished a subjective comment for all those who were occupied or board in the comment
some unique chaplet some authentic relic
they lost themselves and conjectures
who the coral woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making and effort to fly but the dancers laughing with a satanic air

though your worship was not to badly off having in you acy a comparable bey you spoke but i what d i have except the heaviest wat that i think i had in all my life
unlucky me in the muted and bore me
didn't i say so worse luck to my lin said sancho
it cannot be the more answered don quixote but those under enchantment did not let themselves be seen by any one
if they do not leet themselves be seen they let themselves be felt said sancho it not let my shoulder speak to the point
might it speak too said don quixote but that is thought a suspicious reason for believing that will we see he enchanted more
the officer turned room and said well how goes a good man
sanch got up with pain enough in his bones and went after the incur in the dark in meeting the officer who was looking to see what had become of his enemy he said to him senor whoever you are do us the favour and kindnesses give us little rosemary oil salt and white for it is walter to cure one of our best knights erred on earth who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted more that is in this in

sancha ponton who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous begged him to give him what was let in apt which was no small quantity
donkey hot had said it and he taking it with both hands in good pape and with a better we pop to down and dreamed a very little lesson his master
if your worship knew that returned sancho we'll be time me and all my cured why did you let me taste him

sancho took it and as he was raising int to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming sancho my son drink not water drinkin out my son for it will kill thee see here i had the blessed balsam and he held up the flask and liquor and with drinking too chops with thou wil certainly be restored
the strides of a lan man like the ogling glances of a one eyed man they do not reach their goal very promptly
cosette had waked up
jan valjean had paced her near the fire
you will wait for me at a lady's house i shall come to fetch ye
everything h ranged in and nothing is said fourche lavore
i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
thats where the difficulty les
it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out
and she will hold her toime i answer for that
cavan grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean
you understand father madden the goverment one notion it
jean val jon stared him straighten ne i and thought that he was raving
fu she of or went on
it is to morrow that i'm to bring in the priors expense you
then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community
that the nun who had dined that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the fault under the altar of the chapel
that the priors and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil wish of the deceased
that he flush laval was to mail up the coffin in the cell raised the stone in the chapel and blower the corpse into the vault
and then that there was an numa the empty coffin
what is that anti coffin
asked gee ragon fourche loon replied
what coffin what administration
for she loon who was seated sprang up as though were omer had burst under his chair you
you knowed form chiful what you have said mother crucifixion is dead
and i add and father madeline is buried ah
you are not by cher men so the madeline
this offers the means but give me s information in the first pace
how long is the coffin six feet
it is a chamber on the ground floor has a grated window oping on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shatter and two doors one leeds into the convent the other into the church what church
that the church in the street of for church which anyone can enter
have you the kings to those toodles
no i have the key to the door which communicates with the conrad the porter has the ky to the draw which communicates with the church
only to allow the undertakers meant to enter when they come to get the coffin
who mails up the coffin id
who spread the poor labor it
not another man except the police doctor conan enter the deed ram that is even written on wall
could you hide me in that ring to night whenever one is asleep
about three c can the afternoon
i shall be hungry are i will bring you something
you can come a nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock
fourche li over recoiled and cracked his finger joins but that is impossible
bah impossible to take a hammer and drives nails in a plan
jean ran joan had been in worse straight the ms
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
to have himself nailed i in a case and carriage off like a bail of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to economize his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean's bloom talents
you surely must have a gim led you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will may on the top plan pon loosely good and what if you should happen to cough for to see
a man who is making his escape does not cough all sneeze
who is there who has not said to a cat do come in
the over prudent cats as they are and because they at cans sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
but jal valjean's calmer prevailed over him in spite of himself he grumbled
if you are sure of coming out of the coffin right i am sure of getting ya out of the grave
and oar of the old school the great digger puts the corpses in grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
i shall follow that is my business
that's holts the undertakers men not a rope around your often f lower you dam
the priests as the pays nates the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
one of two things will happen he were either be sob or he will not be sober
that is settled father fuca or all well go well
on the fall and day as the sun was declining the very rare passes by on the ble of ladd d men hulled off their hats to an old fashioned harse ornamented with skulls crass brons and tears
this hurst contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a hing corpse with drooping arms
a morning coach in which could be seen a priest in his curls and acquire boy in his red cap followed
behind it came an o man in the garments of a laborer who limber along
the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at might and winter in this cemetery they was subjected to a special discipline
these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when was song disappeared behind the dome of the invalid
dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it
the bourgeois did not care much about being buried and the rajah it hinted at poverty plash andes if you pee
to be buried in peril shes is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognized as elegant
the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the intellection of jean valjean into the deed room all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch let us r one can passing that the burial of mother creasy fiction under the altar of the convent is a perfectly vial offence in our sight
it is one of the faults which resented duty
the mans had committed it not only without difficulty that even with the applause of their own consciences
in the cloister was is called the government is only an intermeddling with authority an interference which is always questionable
make u as many laws as you please men but keep them for yourselves
a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
fashionable limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind
jean valjean's composure was one of those powerful tranquillity which are contagious
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
he played with further mien
he did what he knight with him he made him dance according to his whim
the permission for interment must be exhibited
he was a sort of labouring map who war awa coat with large pockets and carry a matter under his arm
the man replied the great digger
the grave der yes
you i
father mien the brave digger he was
flushing of what had expected anything but this which a grave digger could die
it is true nevertheless that grave diggers doe dy themselves
he had hardly the strength to stammer
but he persisted feebly father mia is the grave digger
do you know who little father lan lace he isn't jug of red wine
but you are a jolly fella
are you not comrade will go have a drink together presently
the man replies
he lamed more out of anxiety than from infirmity
the grave digg walked on in front of him
four slav pass the unexpected kavi once more and review
flush lab who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deer with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
the sir father nest ands dead
the man replied completely
the good god consulted his notebook which shows when the time is up it was far the most hen's turned far the misty and died
stammered fourche lavore it is made
you are a peasant i am the parisian
threshing one thort i am lost
they were only a few churns of the wheel distant from the small ary leading to the nun's corner
and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man whose turning a phrase well
fortunately the soil which was light and wept with the winter reins clog the wheels and retarded it speed
my father was a porter that the pram tell home
but he have reverses he had losses on changed i was obliged to renounce the profession of author but i am still a public writer
but so you are not a grave digger then
returned vs lovel clutching is branch feeble as it was
here a remark becomes necessary
a pava was at his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
the grave digger went on with a superior smile
one must eat
the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake
yes but if i should already ask for something what
well do it for me for i swear you thy don't love you as the others have loved you
there are bolts in the door wretch
i don't know how it is but it's cased to me as if i do
now go i can't keep my eyes open
it seems to me as if this sleeping city belongs to me i searched my memory for their names of those whose happiness i had once an envied and i could not recall one without finding myself the happier
education fly feeling the says of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sents so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first castle of love all the more arden because they seen so pure
the more girl believes in goodness the more isle will she give way if not tor lover at least to love for be without mistrust she is without force and to w her love as a triumph that can be gained by any young men of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must be find it tempting how surely must be listen to the first voice which comes to tell its secrets through their bars and bless the hand which he the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil
with them the body has worn out the soul the senses half burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
they loved by profession and not by instincts
when a creature who has all her past to reproach herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere irresistible love of which she had never felt her self capable when she has confessed her love how absolutely the m whom she loves dominates her
they know not to what proof to give
in order to disturb the laborers in the field was one day devoured by a wolfe because those whom he had so often deceived the longer the leaf in his cries for help
this is the same with these unhappy woman would he love seriously
but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough and soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this men drains at one drought all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
but to return to the first day of malay son
when i reached home i was in the state of mad gaiety
the woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him
how why
my whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first knights
here on my orders to night at the vau ville
candour the third and tract
the boxes filled one after another
only w remained empty the stage box
at the beginning of the thirds act i heard the door of the box on which by eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and marguerite appeared
does she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she looks the happier i should e
what is the magter with you tonight said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
you should go to bed she replied with the ironic error which went so well with a delicate and witty face
where at home
you still love me can you ask
because you don't like seeing him
then to less i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and margery gain into the carriage which was wing for them at the door
i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
you and the way marguerite but how
well you might have had woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive
during this remark marguerite looked at me attentively
my dear prudence i answered you d not know what you are saying
yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up and as i could not met you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
because i am watched and the least suspicion might to me the greatest harm
is that really the only reason
if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
hon slye do careful me a little a great feel
i fancied for a moment there i might give myself that happiness for six months you would not have it you insisted annoying the means
well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
i listened and i gaze that marguerite would admiration
when i thought that this marvellous creature whose feet i had once long to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts by part in her life and that i was not yet content with what she gave me i asked if ms desire had in vied limits when s spied as probably as mine had been it reached after something further
truly she continued we poor creatures of chance have fantastic desire and inconceivable loves
we are not allowed to have hearts u the plenty of thing h down and of ruining are credit
we no longer belong to ourselves
we stand first in their self stained last inter esteem
never do give you advice which is not lucrative
it these little enough to them that we should have ten lover's extra as long as they get dresses or a brace ling out of them and that they can drive and are carriage from time to time or come to our box at future
such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old an old a is neither protects mor consols
i felt i could at set the life which he offered me oh what would you have
what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
maro wit hired out with this long confession through herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough f her the chief to o lips and from that to her eyes
marguerite do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but the name of heaven's tear up the letter which i wrote to you and do not made me leave you to morrow it would kill me
marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
here it is i have bought the back
i tore letter into fragment and kissed with tears the hand thy gav it to me
look here prudence do you know what he wants said marguerite
he want you to forgive him
one has too but he wants more than that what then
i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled

he assisted at it but took no part and in factor was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gabble and laughter like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance

forthwith the grinning juster began sure eking with laughter so that the bells upon his motley cap were all set a jangling
i did but laugh to think the sword of et lari had been so quickly fallow responded the gesture and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailor's girdle
one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes
thou shalt have thy liberty he cried even though thou shouldst run me in pieces the moment thou art free
yet had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful very with filmy wings which shone like rainbows in the moonlight
at this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten
scissors grow a giant's height and save us from the ogre's might
he could see the ogre standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the chasm and gnashing his teeth each one of which was as big as a millstone
the sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as and s fee could carry him
thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this dismal s bou while i have the power to help thee
he lifted the scissors and with one stroke destroy the webb and gave the flights read e
a thing glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole
the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors
as he uttered the words the scissors looped out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shutters as easily as through it cheese
in a very short time the prince and crawled pew the opening
while he stood looking around him and bewilderment a firefly alighted down his arm flashing its little landed and the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me to guy do who a place of safety
what is to become of me cried the poor peasant

he'd thought just acquired to safe musty then rejected already
he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
to stand between two religions from one of which you would not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to that like souls
marius was clear eyed and he required the true light
the half light of doubt cain him
whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
his discomfort was augment by all the reflections which occurred to him
in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
they soon elbowed him abruptly
request go for to come and talk with me said marius
what is to become of you said curran
what are you going to do i do not know
silver gold here it is
you will then have only a pair of trousers a weskit a hat and coat and my boots
that will be enough
no it is not good what we do after that

the close dealer was sent for
he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments they went to the watchmakers
he bought the watch her forty five francs

that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundreds sou very slowly
one morning on as returned from the los school marries found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistol that is to say six hundreds francs and gold in a sealed box
maria sent back with thirty louis toss with the respectful letter in which he stated that he had suspicious means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his knees
at that moment he had the me francs left
he perceived that it was no good talking to the old men and that the principal person in the house was the mother
before her he decided as scatter his pearls
the princess was distracted and did d know what to do she felt she had send against kitty
well doctor decide our fad said the princess tell me everything
he's their hope she meant to say but her lips quivered and she could not outer the question well doctor
as he wis the princess went on of the sigh
the family doctor respectfully ceased mid lib his' osages
and there are indications metric nervous excitability and so long
the question sin thus in presents of indications of tiber cit this process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
yes s an understood thing responded the celebrated physician again waning in his watch
lig pardon is the uske gericht ina or shall have the drave on
he asked ah it is

and how about a tour broad asked the count doctor
what h wanted is the mean of improving attrition enough lowering
the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
but in favor fig travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling and premises
and then the mother wishes it he had
ah well not hast to be sure l and go only those drowning qui a mischievous
oh times up already and he went to the door
the sated doctor announced to the princess a feeling if what was due from him dic pated his doing so that he ought too see the nation once more
oh no only a few dia princess come this way
and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing gom to katy
when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with years
she answered in and all at once got up furious
excuse me doctor about there is really no logic in this
this is the thir tine you've ask me the same thing
the celebrated doctor did not take offence
nervous servility he said to the princess when hey had left the room however i'd finished
and the doctor began sid dick they explaining to the princess as in exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the taking of the waters which were certain the harness
at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged ino deed meditation as though resolving a weighty ber
finally his decision was burns they were to go abroad but to put no fate and foreign quacks and to a plata him and any need
it heem though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had young
the mother was much more cheerful was she went back to her daughter and katy regent to be more cheerful
educated equal of the upper floss are trying to stile ever brewing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social ly
this is absently int erects
in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life has found in groups of individuals individuals were voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interest of the group
the champions of the social conception of light usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence the this connection is quite impossible
the men who was controlled by moral influence ax in accordance with his own desires
the basis of authority is bodily whiles
the possibility of applying bodily viols the people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison and submission to one will
these bands of armed men said missive to a single will are were constitute the army
the army has always been and still hes the basis of power
power is always in the hands of those who control ary and all met power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army then in anything can court popularity of the ary knowing that if fat is on their side their power is secure
indeed it could not be otherwise
only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
the since this is not the case and on the contry men in power always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
even if there was w a time when owing to the low standards of morals on the disposition of men of violence the existence of an authority to restrain such valance was an advantage because the violence of the government was less than the violent of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
between the members of one state subject to a single authority the stripe between the individuals seemed still less and a life of the state seems even more secure
it was produced on one hand by the national growth the population and on the other by struggle in conquest
after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so this state conception of life justifies itself
but this justification h never more than temporary
internal ascensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression deserted by the authority over the decent individuals
govern authority even if it dost suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the governor
and therefore the oppression of the oppress always goes on growing out to the furthest women beyond which it cannot go up killing the goose with the gold knights
the most convincing example this is be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient time subdued that conquest
so it does always been
foot nuts this fact that in america the abuses of authority exist in spite of the small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position de positively confirms it
yep class know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer belong on incitants men they feel there dis curying position depends on the increased drank of the army
the reason to which he gave expressions essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the pops engaged swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of the day so carefully distributed the reproof so that the regiments from the frontier their stationed and central districts and the regiments from the centre are stationed on the frontiers
the meeting of c privy speech put into plan language is it funds are needed nots foreign those but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the in slave toiling masses
and this abnormal order of thanks is maintained by the army
but there is not only one oman their other governments exploiting their such as by violent in the same way and are always ready to pounds down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its in slave subjects
and so every goverment needs an army also the product its booty from its neighbor brigands
this increases contagious as montesquieu pointed outbidding fifty years ago
everye increase in the army of one state with the aim of self offence against its subjects becomes a sort of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase of their armies
the despotism of the government always increases with the strength of the army and his external successes and the restiveness of a government increases with its internal despotism
the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers who obtained at the least possible express
and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practiced upon them all citizens have become their own impresses
this inconsistency h become obvious and universal thar service
in fact the whole significant of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitory a personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life the groups of persons
but with universal mal tarry service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get it of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had meet to avoid
but at set of doing that they exposed to individuals to the same necessity of strife substitute strike with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors
the taxes rays from the people for war preparations absorb the great depart in the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
the danger of war ever ready de break gal rin all reforms of by social like vain and fruitless
with a fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent and the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
government assert that armies are new above all for external defense with that is not true
there are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military service be comes in accomplice and all that acts of violence are the govern against the citizens without any choice of his own
and for the sake of what i making them
im expected for the sake of a state ma the sacrifices to renal everything that can be precious a man peace family security and human dignity
except with the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish the number that there can only be done by change of en barman and moral influence
so that the justification of stained violence on the ground of the protection and gives from evil dispose persons evening if it had some foundation three of four centuries ago has none whatever know
except at the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means a punic so on
without the state men would not have enable to form the social institutions needed for doing anything
this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made m complete be able to dispense with state aid in forming societies associations corporations and congresses were scientific economic and political objects
without governments nations were bein slay by their neighbors
the government they tell us with its army is necessary defends from neighboring states who might en slab us
and if defence against barbarous nations is meant one thousand part of the troops now under ars would be aunty sufficient for that purpose
the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes u on the contrary the much greater danger of such tacks
even looking at it practically weaning that is to say all the birds lid on him by the states no man can fail to see that for him personally to complied with a state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantages than to refuse to do so
to resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not capable
so much for the advantages of disadvantages of both lines of conducts for a man of the wealthy class and oppressor
for a man of the poor working clots the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with the great increase of disadvantages
say you now supper
chris looked from ancle plated flash late to a carr jack can spark plug

christ it off once more passing a bleak little victory and church perch on hill of mister wicker's house
an empty lot cut in into b church lane gave a look of isolations of ail shape brick building it sir mister wicker's both house in place at business
the longer wing toward the back got back door that opened on a water street the space between the house in this guns and ad had been made into a meat up along the flower garden fenced off for the sidewalk by box shrugs in the white picket fence
a livid yellow stained of arising de the factories inlay clouds lowered and tumbled above
the air was growing chill and christ sided the finish the job
all at once he wondered how his mother was and everything in him and pinched and tightened itself
at the foot of the hill he reached the house
there were three things that always caught his eye amant the litter of dusty pieces
or the left the coil of rope in the center the model of a sailings ship in the grain glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of the negro boy and bang trousers turkish jacket and white turban
but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe at home in bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabelle to
he had never seen any one' go into mister wicker's shop now he thought a bed
how then biding lamp and what did ever sell
a sudden car horn walk him from his dream
the many times he had examined mister refers wind know and poured over the rope the ship and the nubian boy he had never gone into mister hooker's shop
some now alone till someone should answer the bell they looked eagerly yet uneasily around him to
what with the one windowed the lower enti outside the long narrow shop with somber
head the hand u beams crossed it from one side to the other
mister ogre's back being toward the source of light chris cannot see his face
the double fans a minute wrinkles breaking from eye corner a temple and joining with those over the cheap bones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the dome forehead
little toss some white pub above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarians hair but what drew and held chris's gaze with the old men's eyes
crisply linked e look again yes they were still there
chris swallow it is wye came back to
sir he said
i set your sign at i know boy who and neats the job
he's a scorne the mine
jis iss name is new reeling is the charm
i i just wondered of the pe m to lop and
what he saw was a fresh chee lad tall for thirteen story wen city and good humour in his face and something sents it in an am pedling about his eyes
and guess there must be a lively fire in that room beyond
with that e fear a ja gig skinning the job sir
but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his minds why do you not see the reflection of the head lights at the cars moving bo round the car of wall under street up the hill towards the eh signals
the room seemed overly still
then in that second de turn and faced about
the wilde bow wh it was there before him and three objects he like best showing fostering the moonlight that toward in from across of water
christ water where was the free way
it was no longer there nor were a high walls and smoke stacks of factories to be seen to
but warehouses were still there
flabbergasted and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer appear out the window and every direction
e electric signs no lap lid streets
when the people's dro store and stood but half an hour before rose the ruse of what was evident an inn
a courtyard was firstly night by flaring torture two shilling the swinging side hung on the post
the posts plated at the edge of it was now prod in money road
the coach with had stopped piled hive with lugged stamp to a halt beside the flint card
they moved to the end the coach rattled off to the stale
my window has a pah for those few who are to see
the learning of magic was pea means easy
y told us master at once he got strive and costlier his hoard of money is hiding places for it
christ therefore threw himself and of all the primaries of his tasks
one afternoon when he had returned after a rest to mister wicker's study he saw that there was something new in the room a b with a gold vision it stood on the tablet mister worker not to be seen
what should all i do first
how you i proved my boy he exclaimed it' n a time for you to try missus is good a change any
supposer chained and catch and back
mister worker went im patiently beside him for a few moments for christo get up his courage
then is nothing happen with a voice like a whip mister wicker's start at once
a sensation spread faster and faster
his head swab and he felt faint noble sick but he persisted through the final words
he thought nor without a feeling or pride and commences experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight with some little time lapt g wore mister wicker's voice boom b ooze
seventy four book one the return
the figure shoes carved in s eastern style a curved up pointing toes
that all at once the idea came to chris
if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
he squatted on his haunches had savin the carved wood and figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companions
but how did one a change in adam it to e of it
gris got up and stole back to mister wicker's door
he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his broome above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was reeling empty we sir jones proper shape and opened the doors of the cover to de far int of the room
the afternoon raining before increased in storm
thus came two hours before its time thunder snarled in the sky
certain elements were to be mixed and poured the proper time
mister worker began moving about upstairs the full boards creaked prank w and still chris could not leave until the potan fumed and glowed
but infinite caution chris clots the doors silently behind him in running light before were greeks to figure at the negro boy
it was as it the step mis melted
under his eyes w folds of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its reality upon the coat at oh the face
the wind grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of car flowers moved a bouquet ful
they went down to their corns first
gess mister finny went to his quarters i don't member seeing him cross the jack who come over that way at all
next net silly was rilling into the helm by over jones it took over ned went on down
it looks to me as if it could b been one of several people and i'll be switched to pin who what give thy eyes opened
the mabel was nearing teeny
weve fu her in fresh stalls to take o mare
a chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down in his cabin
certainly my boy boomed out the captain as blue eyes abruptly keen and pen training
mister finny would be some time on deck we cannot be own heard and here
his face rose with nervousness that this might doll do was an answer and he stood stiff and stone before captain lizards
li captain sat forwards in his chair looking in for a long moment considering
then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say i do
this ship had more to me th wife or mother all family
and pause fingering this lower lip the looking sideways in an reft of fashioned chris standing before him
we shall say no more but i trust you understand the responsibility you have
a ship its cargo in its men will be in your hands
yes sir i think i can do it safely or i should g try sir
captain lizards round pink faced creased in its winning smile
he then went on to describe what else was to follow the covering in the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
be come a flush was not the word the captain or anyone else of his time yet understood
what can he said during that time sir christ thot ask
i am somewhat skill in medicaments i have to be as a captain of ship and crew know it
i shall say that you are in my own cabins i can care for you
not since he had left mister wicker and chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
he knew now that his absence for as long as he had o to be away would be covered up and satisfaction inly accounted for to
their conversation had taken some little while

but harem was not in the mood to share joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his returned he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day and honor of the seventeenth birthday of the old sculptor
she would appear herself at desert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour
so the artist found himself obliged to relinquish hiss opposition
the ban one was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day passed without seeing daffy and telling her the words of the oracle
he longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
since his returned from the oracle the fear of the rescue demeter might yet be the work of merciless had again mastered him
the approval as well as a doubts which it arise and others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bring it into harmony with the facts
then he went directly to the neighbouring pace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
hitherto the merchant been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered and impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy
when hermon entered the residence of the grammaticus in the palace the guests had already assembled
the place by hermon side which ah had chosen herself would then be given up to arina
true an interest in conversations still had powered to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight and referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyments blindness debarred him
a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and woman to whom no tad bound him saved the presence of the same host
creates had really been invited an order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair haired nio had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing ar sins praises among his professional associates
his son had been the royal dam's first husband and she had deserted him to marry list makest the aged king of thrace
the king sister the object of his love cried harmon incredulously

he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arina had remembered him when she heard of thei remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in roads
the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and al thea eagerly confirmed the statement
hm mist into a parent silence
the rodion was just beginning to prise ars know also as a special friend and cons sure of the sculptures art when crates her mons fellows student asked the blind artist and be had of this beautiful companion why his d meter was placed upon a pedestal which to others as well as himself seemed too high for the size of the statue
yet what mattered h even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of score at him
a woman who earns for the regard of all men and makes love of toy easily lessons the demands she imposes upon individuals
only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and atta did not wish to lose harmon's regard
how indifferent who look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you was still a genuine create in artist the case was different
though so loud a denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no id allusion and snag me i can prove
it was nay it could have been nothing alice that very spider
not a sound if you value your lives
to offer resistance would have been madness for even harmon perceived by the loud clanking of weapons round them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prison the place of execution
was he to be led to the executioner's block
what pleasure had like to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art
ought he not to greet is set an end as a boom from the immortals
did it not spare him a humiliation is great and painful as could be imagined
whatever might await him he desire go better fate
if he had passed into annihilation he hermon wished to follow him thither and annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
but if he were destined to meet his bert list and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not tell them howe sure he was a finding a joyful reception there from both
the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was n nemesis no it was a kindly deity
yet it was no allusion that deceived him
again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
sometimes with the touching entreaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philips her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
cried harmon and grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and followed the soldier whom the captain detail to guide her into the palace
to morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to the stags path
ding again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philip of silenced tar with a grave exclamation the order of the king
as soon as the captive artist was alone with a woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forth incoherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly returned the pressure he could not restrain the desire to class purge was heart
in spite of his deep mal distress he could have shouted aloud in his delighting gratitude
he might now have been permitted to find forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger by the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the pullest of the following morning still sealed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought not to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impolicy exclaimed you know that t love you
i love you and have loved you always
doubly exclaimed tenderly what more is needed
but harmon with drooping head murmured to morrow i should no long be what i am now
then d few raised you her face to his asking so the demetri is the work and myrtles

and i fool blinded also mind could be vexed with you for it

and having put himself in a fairway as it hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darcy case colonel ashley went down to police head quarters to learn more facts in the connection with the murder of the east indian
picks and down ein haven they carroll yee up
girl was too much engaged and watching the blue smoke girl lazily upward on mis cigar jess then to say more
are you going to work on lad case colonel
but he had any more to do with a colonel been that cat
perhaps not admitted colonel ashley
we've got our man and that's all we want
you are on the darcy case they tell me in away yes
i marking in the interest of the young man
it's just one of them coined thence like
must his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair
gad explained the colonel
the very pair i was going to buy
look here colonel do you know anything about this
and the detectives professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendless not police in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
i happened to see those candles ticks in the window of single fons shop the other day and i made up my mind to buy them when i had a chance
now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen
fou i don't know whether that's his first or his last name anyhow he had a parker named ser ali
anyhow he in fronted get along very well it seems
neighbors often heard him scrapping al and his half t noon they went at it again the hawk and heavy
toward dark a man went into bu lamp
he found the place without lighted stumbled over something on the floor and there was all ease body with they head busted in and this heavy candle sticker it
sure held so tight we could hard to get it out
maybe the fight was about who w the watch for the dago talked in their foreign angle and none of the neighbours could tell what they were say it i see
and the watch have you it yes the tear
that's the watch announced the headquarters detective reaching in for it going it see
you're not a screams all that are you just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's
and donno it's voice was plain the sceptical
yes it may have some rough agers on it
and i've read enough about germs and know the danger i'd advise you to be careful
if you don't mind i should like to examine this bit
before the big wind and irelands suggested thong with the nodded desire's compatriot slightly to have the colonel
that's route agreed the colonel as it continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
and a close observer might bobs served but he did not touch his bare fingers to the time piece but poked it about and touched it here and there were the end of a lead pencil
and domn take her friends advice and don't be too free with that watch do free with a
has the surprise detective yes
don't scratch yourself on it whatever you do why not
simply because this watch
some one out her to see you
all i be here in a second
shaft was the panting answer
i want to talk over darcy's case with you the colonel had said and the two had talked at thought had talked again and now were silent for a time
what are the chose of getting him off legally if we go lighted from a negative standpoint asked the colonel
rather i pathetic question colonel but i should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition
at best he would get off with a scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn't want that nor do i
and you i don't want it either
but i want to know just where we stand now i know
but i needed to do a little more smoking out first now i want to think
if you'll excuse me i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may kat something
in fact i e a feeling d i land my fish
i'd recommend him to you instead of blackstone think slapped kenneth
what it perhaps i can help you
the old adage of two head you know
yes it's still holes good
no l mony replied the colonel puzzled yes just that
and there's no reason you should know
chuckled the colonel as he skilfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook
and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip in n limped fish into the creels colonel ashe to gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
the reason she asked no alimony inquired kenneth
no i wasn't thinking of that
however don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough fort they
well i don't know that you can
it isn't general and known went on the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him
it was one of what at first m be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of a baser sort
you don't mean that large struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did
the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him
ar and graft in statement was being unexpected great confirmed
he remembered that cynthia and grafted and had once been in love with each other
she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer
because large made no defence
larch by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
so i had to let her have her way and muzle ask the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my council fee
no but he will or i'll sole him and get judgment oh he'll pay all right
and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up
still i would like to know
the murderer of missus darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweler was tried
it had a double reputation shall to speak
grave and even reverend the conventions assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper if not better class were frigate he seen in it dining room or cafe
large himself was a peculiar character
in a smaller place he would have been called a solon keeper
and it was this man rich over said handsome certainly that cent thea wretch ford had married
to this was the answer whispered money
and in away was true
she also sided opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges
after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the larch hotel it could hard to be called a home became the scene of many festivals
then it was set of large that shoon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treats wife with the refined cruelty that hidden away from the publick underneath his habitual matter there was the wrongness of the brute
but it was notice that the older and more conservative families were less off on represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations for already smouch are who had not yet acquired any and m rolling to take a chance
it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me in the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as o the judges and members of the barr to be seen there cannot explain to the colonel
meanwhile colonel ashley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he saw dar se frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something to be done always returned the answer
don't worry you will come out all right
i'm going di rectify them but it will take time
it's heart from hiss maas and too although she's bearing up like a major
so king god bail who put it up
it was hy larch
they took carry away while ago
but he is a pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same
only that i darcy hesitated and grew red
good evening carl he called gie will you join me in a weals rabbit
thank you no
i'm afraid my digestion isn't quiet up to that as i had to cut out my fishing of late
now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder
the stopped clocks for instance have you any theory
there were three of them the centre figure b gone of harry king and he was very much intoxicated
that is not always but sometimes it happened to be so now
i beg your pardon he said in the country tones he know so well how to use yet of which he made so low use of late
i said were have you been remarked thegither we've missed you
i said i was gulping he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort
by polonius somewhat ask
because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles of certain person hair who talks to much but who is not so wise as he thinks
there was a rattle of coin on the mahogany bar as king sought to disentangle a single bill from the waded up currency at his pocket
it's it's an odd coining an old roman one that missus darcy had in her briac collection kept in the jeweler's store safe was the whispered answer
i went over them ne the day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed
that was hers went on the dure
now harry king has it exclaimed colonel ashley
even the sun came out bale and watery at known

then i took up a great stone from among the trees and coming up to him smote him therewith on the head with all my might and crushed in his skull as he lay dead drunk
behold a ship was making for the island through the dash and sea and flashing waves
hearin this i was sore troubled remembering what i had before suffered from the ape kind
upon this he brought me a cotton bag and given it to me said take this bag and fillet with purples from the beach and go forth with a company of the townsfolk to whom i will give a charge respecting thee
do as they do and be like thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land
then he carried me to the beech where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pebbles
to these he committed me commend in me to their care and saying this man as a stranger so take him with you and teach him how together that he may get his daily bread and you will earn your reward in recompense in heaven
now sleeping under these trees were many apes which when they saw us rose and fled from us and swarmed up among the branches whereupon my companions began to pell them with what they had in their bags and the apes fell to plucking of the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk
we weighed anchor and shahrazad proceeded the dawn of the day and ceased saying o permitted say
when it was the five hundreds and fifty ninths night
and ceased not sailing t we arrives safely at buss area
there i abode a little and then went i on to bagdad r entered my quarter and found my house and for gathered with my family and saluted my friends it gave me joy of my safe return and i laid up all my goods and valuables in my store houses
after which i returned to my old merry way of life and forgot all i had suffered in the great prophet and gain i had made
next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawn prayer and after blessing mohammed the cream of all creatures betook himself to the house of sinbad the seaman and wished him a good day
here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales therein
happily amongst you is one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up and all th everything on board of her were plunged into the sea
but at burneth in their bellies so they cast it up again and it congeal ith on the surface of the water whereby its color and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it ashore and the travelers and merchants who know it collected and sell it
each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides and after little the rest of my fellows perished one by one till i had buried the last of the party and boat alone on the island with but a little provision left are who was won to have so much
but there is majesty and there is no might save in alla the glorious the great
when it was the five hundred and sixty first night
then sign for myself i set to work collect in a number of pieces of chinese and corner aloes wood and i bound them together with robes from the wreckage then i chose out from the broken up ships straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the allows wood making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel of the stream and i tied it tightly and firmly as though it were nailed
land after land shalt thou see and find but no other life on thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul and they thoughts are night al wo shall lend or sooner or late
i rode my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried with a raft with it down the underground channel
and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft by reasoner of the narrowness of the channel whilst the stream ceased not to carry me along knowing not night from day for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me about in my terror and concerned for myself lest i should perish
when i awoke at last i found myself in the light of heaven and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft moo to an island in the midst of a number of indians and ab sins
but i was delighted at my escape from the river
when they saw i understood the night and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me an arabic peace be with thee o my brother
on my brother answered he we a husbandman untill us of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding thee asleep on this raft laid hold of it and made it fast by us against thou should us awake at thy leisure
i answered for our lad's sake and my lord ere i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after asked me what thou wilt
when it was the five hundred and sixty second night
she said it had the reached me our auspicious king that sin bad the seaman continued when our landed and found myself amongst the indians and abbas inns and had taken some rest they consulted among themselves and said to one another there is no help for it but we carry him with us and present him to our king that he may acquaint him with his adventures
so i consorted with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respects
so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing to set out with the merchants for that i pin after my people and my own land
quoth he thou art thine own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us on o head eye be it for thou gladden us with thy company
by alla are my lord answered i thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with thy favours and well doings but i weary for a side of my friends and family in native country
then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchants afore said
he asked me whence they came and i said to him by alla a commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way thither
for state processions are thrown is set for him upon a huge elephant eleven cubits high and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks on his right hand and on his left
his letter have shown me this and as for the mightiness of his dominion thou hast told us what thou hast die witnessed
presently my friends came to me in i distributed presence among my family and gave arms and marges after which i yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment mirth and merry making and forgot or but i had suffered
such then are my brothers is the history of what befell me in my six the voyage and to morrow in shall are
i will tell you the story of my seventh in last forage which is still more wondrous marvellous than that of the first six
when it was the five hundred and sixty third night
she said it hath reached me our auspicious king that when sinbad the sam and had relighted the history of what befell him in his sixth the voyage and all the company had dispersed sinbad the landsman went home and slept as of want
the seventh voyage of sindbad the sam
no o company that after my return for my sixth the voyage which brought me abundant prophet i resumed my formal life and all possible joyance and enjoyment and mirth and making mary day and night and i tarried some time in this solace and satisfaction till my soul began once more to long to sail the seas and sea finn countries and company with merchants and here new things
s having made up my mind i packed up in bales a quant to give precious stuffs suited for sea trade and repaired with them from bagdad city to baser town where i found a ship ready for sea and in her are company of considerable merchants
but the captain arose and tight him in his girdle tucked up his skirts and after take in refuge with alla from sate and the stoned climbed to the masthead whence he looked out right and left and gazing at the passengers and crew fowl to buffet in his face and plucking out his beard
this he set in a saucer wet it with the little water and after waiting a short time smelt and tasted it and then he took out of the chest a booklet wherein he read a while and said weeping no o ye passengers that in this book is a marvellous matter dene that whoso come did that shall surely die without hope of escape for that d ocean is called the sea of the clime of the king wherein is a sepulchre of our lords solomon son of david on both be peace
a second fish made its appearance and which we had seen naught more monstrous
when suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship which rose out of the water and settled upon a great reef the haunt of sea monsters where it broke up and fell asunder into planks and all and everything on board were plunged into the sea

hence the society in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in white hall and dawning street and other affected centres

lady earnest in pagan coat hiss mother moved in circles which were entirely bend their compass or ambitions and the sun would probably one day be an ambassador
hasp and wife looked blandly and desperately at one another
it was missus peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there are thieves in the house we kep the drawing room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while wear at breakfast
she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not be stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later there a clean jug in her hands
the pigeon coats had turned paler than ever missus peter had a final inspiration
peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lives so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed within measurable distance
missus peter turned to her guest with confidential kindness

then as archie stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he reid the faint rustling once more and again all was silent
he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full vexation injure amore proper as the pinch caller love of our own danite and which arch of bol g stroke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british orficer had a pretty good stock
and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher ladd
col murr came on this idea directly as he recalled the facts that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless sit at people who would stop at nothing
no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would not me about
the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after the little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter is quickly as he could
to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest point signal for help mona boat's crewe rory surging for him how to escape
but window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them mildly fitted into the stone sill
next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old fashioned marble mantel piece fireplace juny
yes if other rays failed he could escape up the chimney
no that was too bad he can not do that
sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hose were completely gone now and he said as teeth fast and mentally called himself a week idiot for ever thinking about such people
a narrow table against the wall and two places
he went tried to force his head through recalling as he did that where a person's he would go the rest of the boy would pass
but there was no chance for his body there that had would not go first
a fellow who was shut up in prison for life m do it he said but not in a case like this

the dull sound of de parting steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin or ach r stroke way with his heavy eelids pressed down by sleep
what a queer dreamy shall to himself
but how queer for mister gurr to be talking like that to ange you teal the boy who help to the cook
and why did dandy coal mister gurr father
there was interval of thinking over this knotty question during which the low whistling went on
and i'm hungry too tell i was up my suppose
no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint missed hung with reads of smoke
what did they say false alarm tell servants th they would clear all away to night see if anything had been left about lobster wrote
on s of that room he could ram and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunting them
oh those bars he mental they exclaimed and he was advancing towards them when just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window the couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of bootes against stone work and rams face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young man chip instead
there was the first to recover from the surprise
oo he said ho

archie stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
he has gone to give the alarm th the prisoner and he looked suddenly round for away escape
nothing but the gene presented itself
a happy inspiration and come and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curve dirk glanced at the edge ran to the windows and began to cut it one of the bars labor in vain
he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks in grating sounds as he realized that the attempt was madness
there result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him ess say the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear selling sound as he found that now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept u working well for twenty four hours she would not get through
but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the dirk into a sheath
no i can't part with that ha ha ha laughed the board jeeringly

it was immediately following the rock ism robber eight dira that their first appeared a delivered and listen of some local papers and missouri to connect us with this robbery
i urged on the boys that whatever happen we should not shear me one
the miller and i across the bridge the three were on some dow good boxes at the corner near the bank and as soon as they saw us went rid into the bank instead of wedding for us to get there
when we came up i too mow to shot the bank door which they had left open in the hurry
shee yes helen whose hard wor store wass near try to into the bank that miller ordered him away and you ran a on the corner shouting
git your gun's boys there robbing the bank
and i called to him to get inside at the same time faring a pistol shouting the air as a signals to the three boys at the bridge that we had been discovered
almost at this instant i heard of pistol shot in the bank
cad weel woods and jim rode up and joys shouting to the feele in the street to get inside and firing their pistols to emphasize their commands
if any of our party shot him it must have been woods
meantime the street was getting uncomfortably hot
every time i saw any one with a beat on me i would drop off my horse and try to drive the sheer inside but i could not see in every direction
doctor wheeler who had gone upstairs in the hotel shot miller and he lay dying in the street
changing his pistol to his left hand bob ran out and mounted village mayor
what kept you so long ey pits
his to the rest of the affair inside the bank i take the account of the north field narrator
was a money outside to safe by that
the showers were closed and this cause bunker an instance to lay that was almost fatal fits chasing with a bullet
the first when missing but to second through his right shoulder
that night is started to rain and we wore out our horses
friday removed toward water bill and friday night we can't between elysian and german lake
bob shattered elbows requiring frequent attention and that night we made only iron miles and monday munday night in two state we spent in a deserted farmhouse close to man cato
that they a man nam done in discovered us some we took him prisoner
finally we administered to him and oath not to betray our whereabouts until we at time to make our escape and he agreed ned
no sooner however was he released that he made post haste into man cato to announce our presence and in a few minutes another posse was looking force
the whistle on the old mal blue and we feared that it was a signal that had been agree upon to alarm the town in case we were observed but we were not molest
he had to sleep with it pillow o my breast jim being also cripple with a wound in his shoulder and we could not get much sleep
but they soon after to get close enough so that one of them broke my walking stink with a shot
we were insight of our long sal horses when they cut us all from the animals and our last hope was gone
six steps to the front sheriff crispin colonel ov the in rice g a brave see pomeroy and as j severs
forming in lion four paces apart he ordered them to advance rarely and concentrate to fire of the whole line the instant the robbers were discovered
make for the horses i said every man for himself
theres no use stopping to thick up a comrade here for we can't getting through the line just shards them and make it it we can
i get up as a signal for the charge and we fired one volley
one of the fellows in the outer lin not bra enough himself to join the volunteers who had come in to be to sil was not disposed to believe in the surrender and had his going leveled on bob in spite of the handkerchief which was waving as a flag of troops
sire of glisten of w one county who was taking bob's pistol from him was also shouting to the fellow
including th received in and on the way from north field i have eleven wounds
in caff lessens order not to sheet was the beginning other protector that menot a people established over us
captain murdock
but mars port had flourished enough to kill it off
some of mar's laws dated from the time when lawn force ment had been hammered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
the stone wi gang numbered perhaps five hundreds
even dare lex in failures had to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which eat out some kind of a marginal living
they were safe from protection rackets there none bothered to come so far out
the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
captain murdock was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
the pressure was enough to get them for him
gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
i've got a free hand and we're going to run this the way we would on earth
your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
the first man making a shake down we'll get the same treatment were going to use on the stone wall boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
he picked out five of the men including gordon you five will come with me
the rest if you can tem up any way you want to night pick any rout the to open they'll came men lust go
bruce gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick and murdoch's eyes fell on him earth cup
two year's gordon admitted
for a second gordon cursed himself
he began wondering about security then
nobody had tried to get and touch with him
there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim floss for bab glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
moving in two groups of threes it opposite sides of the street they began their beat
there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lac of bear
gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands
gordon's eyes popped at that
he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
the other four copse had come in reluctantly
he brought him to the ground was a single blow crossed the kidneys
they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cup started off
to find a pone and called the wagon
were not using wagons murdo tor him lying them up
if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were clubbed carefully
murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulder shaking and tears running down his cheeks
the captain's face was a sick as gordons felt
i want the name of everye man and the gang ye can remember he told the man
colonel they'd kill me i don't know
murdo took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tufts
if he said turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
trouble began brewing shortly after though
murdo sant one of the men to pick up a second squat of six and then a third
and the third one bu scorn and spotted one of the men had been beaten before
get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
but the captain stirred finally sighing
now the cops are giving me were covered gordon
but the stern while gang is backing wain
but us going to be tough on them
bruce gordon grimmest i've got a yellow ticket from security
murdock blanked he dropped his eyes slowly
what makes you think wain will be re elected
nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
ever see a martian election
no your first he can't lose
and then hell is going to pop in this whole planet may be blown wide open
it fitted with the dia predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner
cost a more but they be respectable
because i he is always honest according to have he sees its
but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
the groups grew more experienced and murdock was training a new squad every night
it wasn't exactly equal but nothing was here
this could le to abuses as he'd seen on earth
but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor wain was re elected
it was night outside and the poser bobs at the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house
it had probably been years since any had dared wrist get after the sun went down
and the slow doubtful respected on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that hay system was working
gordon hit the signs witch and the mars speaker led out a shrill whistle
gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
you can't do it to me and
i'm reformed i'm going street
you damned cops cant una was blubbering
one look was enough the work papers had the tell tail over thickening of the signature they had showed up on other papers obviously forgeries
some turned away as gorden and the other cop went to work but most of them warn't squeamish
when it was over the two picked up their whimpering captive
chink ands the other cop had been holding the wallet
must been making a big contact and something fifty fifty
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
when gordon and jenkins came back murdo tossed the money to them split it
whatever comes to hend gov'nor
like this social call a gordon asked him
the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober note
you me some bill's governor
eleven hundred fifty credits
you didn't pay up your pledged to a captain fund so i had a fillin
a thousand interest at ten percent a week standard right
gordon had heard of the friendly interest charge on the side here but he shook his head wrong is he
hah is he turned it over and shook his head
now show me where i signed any agreement saying i'd pay you back
for ast second izzie's face went blank then he chuckled
he poured out the bills and handed them over
thanks his e thanks yourself
the kid pocketed the money cheerfully noding
the little guy new mars as few others did apparently from all sides
and if any at the other cups had private rackets of their own izzie was undoubtedly the man to find it out and used the information with a beat such as that even going hales and with all the graft to the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped into the bench
go on except dim it
there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
the little publisher was back at the crusader again
only gordon and sheila were left
credit had been established again and the business is were open
gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwelling spilt like the dome but opaque the privacy
they had been lucky
shore bird's volunteers were official now
fats place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed gordon drop to a stool slipping off his helmet
he reached automatically for the class of eh needle beer
thought ye'd be in the chips
that's mars gino other's comment why don't you pull off the planet thats you could go back to earth i'd guess father nodded
guess a man gets us to anything hell maybe i can hi some bumps to sit around and mop it up when the ships come in and bell this is a real old martian den of sin
there was a grin on the other space
finally got our orders for you it's mercury
we sent fy others a same way and they failed
lets say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
you can't stay here
there's a rocket waiting to tranship you to the m on the way to mercury right now gordon side
and i paid her the pay we you from the timely begin using your beds she's out shopping
but his old eyes were glinting
did you think we'd let you go without seeing you off cover he asked
ay a oh dread it i'm getting old is he you tell him
he grabbed gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank izzie shook his head
any colchester had begun to make pince with leslie
