there's ion they say in all our blood and a grain or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
margaret said mister hale as he returned from shown his guest downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thornton made his confession of having been a shop boy
you don't mean that you thought me so silly
i really like that account of himself better than anything else he said
his statement of having been a shop boy was the thing i like best of w
you who were always accusing people of being shop he at helstone
i don't think mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some part of what he said
his father dying in miserable circumstances
why it might have been in the world house
his father speculated wildly failed and then cure himself because he could not bet the disgrace
all his formal friends shun from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
no one came forwards to help the mother and this boy
at least no friend came forwards immediately and mister thornton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
so they lived milton
how tainted asked her father
o papa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade in making money
and the poor men around him there were poor because they were vicious out of the pale his sympathies because they had not his ion nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
not vicious he never said that
improvident and self indulgent were his words
margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
however out it came
papa i do think mister thornton a very remarkable man but purse me i don't like him at all
him i do said her father laughing
personally as ye call it and all
i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
but good night child
there was several other science of something wrong about missus hale
she had dixon held mysterious consultations in a bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was accustom when any distress of her mistress called up on her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chambers soon after dixon lifted and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
but though she received presses and f words back again in touch profusion as would have glad in her formerly yet she felt but there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
she lay wet very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
a servant give dixon permanent resistance should be got if she gave up the whole times to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attention she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
visiting register officers seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she met bessy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
well busy how are you
better are not better if you know what that means
not exactly replied margaret smiling
i'm better in not being torn to pieces by coughing the nights but i'm weary and tired of milton and longing to get away to the land of boola and when i think i'm father and father off a heart sinks none no better i'm worse
margaret turned round to walk on side of the girl in her feel progress homeward
but for a minute or two she did not speak
at last she said in a low voice
missy do you wish to die
bessy was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
not worse than many others are reckon
but what was it
you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quicker understanding what you mean as if i'd lived or my life in milton
i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly
i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful line as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
as they turned up into a small court opening out into a spiled street betty said
youll not be daunted de father's at home and speaks bit gaff ish at first
but nicholas was not at home when they entered
pas bessy at last
busy took a long and feverish draught and then fell back and shut her eyes
margaret bent ogre and said bessy don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or may have been
remember who gave it to you and made what it is
now i'll not have my wench preached to
but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of laft was to be
i believe were i see and no more
that's what i believe young woman
i don't believe all i hear no not by big deal
but whose come at last and whose welcome as long as who will keep them preaching on what who knows not about
its simple are not far to fetch nor h to work
but the girl and he played the moor was margaret
turpin hardly on him he's a good man hes
i sometimes think i shall be murk with sorrow even in the city of god if other is not there
her feverish collar came into a cheeks and the feverish flame into her eye
but you'll be their father you shall o my heart
she put her ar to it and became ghastly pale
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest on her bosom
presently the spasm that fore shuddered death had passed away and bessy roused af and said
i'll go to bed it's best place but catching that margaret's gown you'll come again i know you will but just say it
oh come to morrow said margaret
margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
she was late for tea at home
have you met with a servant dear
mamma that an abruptly would never have done
s'pose i try said mister hale
everybody also had their turned at this great difficulty now let me try
i may be the singular to put on the slipper after all
what would you do papa i would you set about him
why i would apply to some good house mother to recommend me one known to herself or her service
very good but we must first catch our house mother
the mother of him spur to us said margaret
mister thornton the only mother he has i believe said mister hale quietly
i shall like to see her she must be an uncommon person her mother added
perhaps she m have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
she sounded to be such careful economical person that i should like any one out of the same family
my dear said mister hale alarmed o don't go off on that idea
i am sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
take notice that this is not my kind of hainous papa if i have any at all which are own agree to or you always accusing me of it
i don't know positively that it is hers either but from little things i've gathered from him i fancy s

what's bet there said dicky
replied he of a truth i heard him not and i watch him not and folks are all sleeping
but she said whomsoever thou seest awake hes the reciter
then said the eunuch art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him
rejoined the eunuch who then was the reciter point him out to me
by allah replied the firemen i tell thee the truth

and he also improvised the too following this stit
when ne thought al zaman heard the thirst improvisation she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their will o home then she wept and cried to the eunuch and said to him w to thee
he who recited the first time hath recited the second time and i heard him hard by
by allah and thou fatch him not to me i will assuredly roused the chamberlain on thee and ye shall beat thee and cast yee out
but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt
returned quickly and linger n
when it was the seventy third nine
but the e loch said i will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returning to my lady without him
now when the fireman heard these words he feared for sow machan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch by allah it was not i and they know him not
so go thou to thy station and if thou gave meet anyone after this hour reciting aught of paltry whether he be near or far it will be i or someone i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me
then he kissed the oo's head and spake him fair till he went away but the castrato fetched around and returning secretly came and stood behind the firemen fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
i say what made my ignoring what have the beater cap i train far be from me thou land to flee nor will i bow those who blame and for such law would deal me shame
then said the eunuch tzu machan pas me with thee o my lord
o my lord continued the eunuch and shahrazad perceived at the dawn of day and seized to say her permitted say
we will do thee no upright o my son nor wrong thee in ought but our object is that thou bend d gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and returning wheel and safety and thou shall have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news
then the eunuch went out to soul machan and said to him reside what verses thou knowest for my ladies here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thin native country and thy condition
and also these
then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and away fell down in a fainting fit
when the eunuchs saw the case he wandered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
after awhile they came to themselves and uz al zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression laughed her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
accordingly she told him all that had come to her since the separation at the kan and what had happened to her with the matai how the merchant had both her of him and had taken her to her brother shark and and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of b how he had made their marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the king their sire had sent and asked for her from shark and
but now go to thy master and break him quickly to me
the chamberlain called castrato and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the talker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girding his ass and preparing for flight
she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the talker girted he ass for plied and bespake himself saying oh would i knew what is become of him
i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence this pages about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime
why didst thou say i never repeated these couplets nor i know who repeated them when it was thy companion
but now i will not leave thee between these place and but that and what betideth thy comrade shall bide thee
was as i feared the canals discerning but on to allah we are all returning
then the eunuch cried upon pages saying take him off the ass
and he answered i am the chamberlain of the amir of damascus king sharpen sung over marina woman low budd and of the land of carson and i bring tribute and presence from him to his fathering bad dad
so fairy forwards no harm shall befall you till you join his grand wazir than done
then he bad him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was trembling to the emir of damascus and was bound to king lamar with presence and the tribute of syria
so it was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the king's son sharpen and m came sultan over his father's rail
and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet zau machan for quoth they his name be light of the place and he hath a sister new hat zaman hies the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for ah jus and none wanteth what is become of them
so he turned to the wazir gan dan and said to him badly your tale is a wonder of wonders
no o chief wazir that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions for let his almighty will restore ith to you zaraisky zaman whereby we will settle the matter as with easily can
when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with grey joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the tway and what befell them and the cause of their long absence
salam can bowed his head awhile and then said i accept the position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way
then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharpen
after a while the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of bac dad and chorasan a conquering host like the pool tide sea and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and seized to say her permitted say
when it was a seventy eighth night
any meat all rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place
lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zahm kan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and sires son speer
moreover the sultan commanded his wazir than done co at ten days halt of the army that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain
he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days

so then the ring master he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could s stay on the horse
it warn't funny to me though i was all a tremble to see his danger

he shed him so thick the kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits

he was often moning and morning at way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying oh little elizabeth

why before he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when he'd take off his new white beaver an make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he'd walk right out of the ark and maybe was old of vitiges himself
jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my pier ready

i'd done so and then we all three started on again
the young chat was mighty thankful city was tough work toting his baggage such weather
p asked the king where he was goin and the king told him he'd come down a river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there the young fellow says

when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got all
now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags

they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would they tell you

phelps was one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look alike
i went around and climb over the back style by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen
i out with a yes'm for i thought
so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
when we got there she set me down in a split bottom chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
well it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt
and ill thin ke died afterwards he was a baptist
yes it was mortification that was it
your uncle's bent up to the town every day to fetch you

why child it'll be stole
it was kinder thin ice but i says
i had my mind on the children all a time i wanted to get them out to one side and pumped them a little to find out who i was
pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my bight because she says
i see it warn't a bit of us to try to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
so i says to myself here is another place where i got to rest the truth
i open my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes
children don't you say a word
i see i was in a fixed now
missus phelps she jumps for him and says

i can't imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy
uneasy she says i'm ready to go distracted
he must a come and you've missed him along road
oh don't distress me any more nome already distressed
why silas look yan up the road ain't that's somebody comin
the old gentleman stared and says
i hain't no ida who is it
is tom sawyer
being time sawyer was easy and comfortable and its stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river
then i says to myself s'pose time ser comes down on that boat
but i am huge she pleased that you have seen my lady
i knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
for conversation has more charms than can be in mere beauty and a humor and disposition would make a deform person appear lovely
why did you not send me that news and a garland
why the best hon is i have a squireen that is as good as a night
in earns we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish and occasion as i cannot tell which is strangers
all the people that i had ever and my life refused were brought again upon stage like richard the thirds ghosts to reproach me with and all the kindness discoveries could make i had for you was late to my charge
my best quantities if i have any that are good served but for aggravations of my fault and i was allowed to have written understanding and discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in this
tis a strange change and i'm very sorry for it but i'll swearing or not had to help it
is the fish is a squire things and has so many mistresses than anybody may pretend a share in him and be believed though i have the honor to be his near neighbor to speak freely i cannot brag much that he makes an me court to me and i know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often
i think my youngest brother comes down with him
i can no sooner give you some little hints whereabout they live but you know them presently an i meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
but it seems this gentlemen is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if i inclining to loo graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
i have missed four fits and i had but five and have recovered so much strength as may be venture to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
go besides i can give you others
i am here much more ar of people's way than in town for my aunt in such as pretend and interesting me in a power over me do so persecute me let their good nature will take it so ill that they are not accepted as i would you live in a hollow trey to avoid them
youll think him altered and if it be possible more melancholy than he was
if marriage agrees n better with other people than it does with him i shall pray that all my friends may escape it
well in earnest if i were prince that ladies should be my mistress but i can give no rule to anyone else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing your hearts to her may be infinitely taken with one i should not value at all for so a justinian wis providence has ordained it that by their different humans everybody might find something to please them starves withal without envying their neighbours
the matter is not grey for confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best please never to be known in it one any occasion whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly avoided one must satisfy oneself by doing nothing that one needed care knows
if i had a picture that will fit for you he should have it
how can he talk of de faring fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you could
i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am sudden he knows yet most of the injuries you have received from her
we have had another to beat but much more calmly
then besides there was a time when we ourselves when indifferent to one another did i do so then or have i leaned it since
i have been studding how to cheek might come by his intelligence and i very believe he has it from my cousin peters
how kindly do i take the civilities of your fathers in earnest ye cannot imagine how his let appease me
would it would leave me and then i could be i shall not always have occasion for it
by poor lady vavasor is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against a protector and did not discover it
she has told now all that was told her but vows she will never say from whence she had it we shall see whether her resolutions areas unalterable as those of my lady kalis
i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
i never saw anyone yet that did not look simply and out of countenance whatever knew were wedding well design but one and that was of two persons wet time enough i confess to contrive it and nobody the pleas in ab themselves
the truth is i could not endure to be missus bride in a public ready be made the happiest personal earth
do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather and fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
yet in ernest your father will not find my brother payton wanting and civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters to me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set higher value upon her sister and she deserves
my aunt told me no longer gone and yester they that i was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome take heed
you see i give you th warning
by the next i shall be gone to kent m when other journeys laid aside which i am not displeased at because it would have broken o intercourse very much
here are some those as a comedies on me all you like them
i told you in my last that my suffer journey was lad aside and that into kent hasten
if i drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will i bequeath all my kindness to you in it for the charge never to bestow all upon another mistress lest my ghost rise again and haunt you
indeed i like him extremely and he is commended to me by people that know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than they i did not intended silver i can assure you
i do not find it why am told i was so extremely when i believed you love me
but i am called upon
directed for your master
i see you can chid when we please then with authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded for a very good principle in me
we d hear not that our tongues lie more on one side of our mars and the other for fear of overturning it
you are satisfied i hope at this that i escape drowning
but i am troubled much you should make so ill the journey to sore little purpose indeed i writ by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my matters
how w grim you will be but alas
for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to notice an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission
they laughed to hear me say that one unkind word destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase every day if it were possible but never lessen
you go broad all day and play all night and say our prayers when we a time
wh in silver earnest now i would not live thus a twelvemonths to gain all that king has lost unless it were to give it him again
will you be so good nature
he has one son its a finest boy that eery saw and has a noble spirit beget stands in that all his father at one word from him is as much as twenty rings
we must give me leave to entertain your th us with discourses are the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
not to knowing you would come home i can assure you nor for any other teacher on my own but with a cousin of my that had long designed to make herself sport with him and did not miss of her aim
in my life i never heard so ridiculous and discourse as he made us and noor old woman who passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
ever since this adventure i have had so great belief in all things were this nature that i could not forbear laying a peas cart with nine peas in under my door yesterdays informed by it that my husband's name should be thomas how do you like that
she put her head down turned his good back put her feet on the fender and took patter into her lap all of which arrangements signified that something very important had got to p thought over and sen
the more propos was the more credit
af tide it unlighted and maybe dis the consequence of that night's fun
just suppose it is true that he does ask me and tic a yes
what a spiteful thing i am
i toed to so much for a at home how i should him shy that
let me see how can i begin
he has known how all her life and has a good influence over her
now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed him more than once the weak for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided she missed the blessing little interviews that used to put a certain flavour of romans into her dar hard working days
i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that knows attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence and she suspected
it was that indescribable something which women are wick to see and feeling men who have been pressed the wise and good mothers
this had an especial charm to polly for she soon found that this sid of his character was not shown to everyone
lately they changed especially towards polly and it filled her more than she would confess even to herself
at first she tried to think she could but unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even gratitude
polly felt a very cordial friendship for mister sydney but not one particle of the lu feted only kind in which laugh can mutually paid
this finished polly's indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girls with the spies of the old eve in her composition
when said that te came polly started as usual f visit to back he and best but couldn resist stopping at the shores to leave a little pass of a fiend that was calling time
a foolish little speech to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tender hearted girl trying do her duty
take hold of massa charley's hand miss mamy and bo pretty like willie and flossy said the maid
at the street corner at black eyed schoolboy was parting from a rosy face school girl whose music role he was reluctantly s andrey
how he got there was never very clear to pony but there he was flushed and a little out of pet but looking so glad to see her till she had not the heart to p stiff and cool as she had fully int turned it to be when they meant
cheerily could not help it it was so blessing to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
that is the way i get the was answered polly
she did not mean to tell but his fry was so agreeable she forgot herself
but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she choice to meant her forts though she won't own it and t surprised you some day by the amount of heard and sense and goodness she has got
thank you no
her lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
as the out for young man laying a drap into which polly immediately fell
he was quickly to take a hint than she had expected and being buff bled and generous wo to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as paris's own
so and you made a last poy and remark he said quietly watching your face keenly all the while i thought so ba i'm going out of town and business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me annoyed
she thought she had a good deal of the coquette in her and i've no doubt that with time and draining she would have become a very dangerous from person but now she was farr transpose straightforward by nature even to tell a white like lovely
he was going before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first and paps the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and excepted denser ands
parley did not return to a favor walk till should learned for many that uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the ways a pleasant after all
lugging too and for as usual what's the news with you
perhaps she told him
utterly done with and laid upon the shelf
mie said the other day she reached she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the bottles and that fs above rabs
now don't be affected polly but just tell like a dear has not he proposed
don't you think he means to
truly julie fair
i don't mean to be prying but i rey thought he did
well i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have
i just gave him the hint and he took it
he meant to go away before that sod think his heart is broken or mind what city tatler say
he understood and being a gentleman made no firs
but polly it would have been a grand thing for you
i'm a you know i'm prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days
never mind what the business was it surfaces to say that it was a good beginning for young men like tom who having been borne and bad in the most conservative glass of the most conceited city in new england needed just the healthy harts aired influences of the rest to write in his views and make a man of him
fortunately everyone was so busy with the missy probations that there was no time for romans of any sort when the four young people worked together soberly insensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not buttered up in their respective hurts
pity that the end should come so soon but the hour did its work and rend its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind but the young folks did not see it them for their ice within because of the partings that must be
if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a summer town but sydney often called to his vacation came and the voluminous close bonds of polly beguiled the long days
time wr once weather but the letters were sure in that very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear
now i'm only tired had a good dear to do lately and the dull weather makes me juster double brew
forgive me polly but i can't help saying it for there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can
i why not deceive myself but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me
thank heaven for that
cried polly with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice
poor parley was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say
none were needed i told her face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish boast which and the hundreds are after it
once or twice but sort of chokingly and i thought it was only some little flirtation
it was jest good of me not a guest before
it was her tender earnest and defiant that fanny forgot the defence of her own lover and ignorant of polls loyalty to hers for this faithful all ab sobbing love was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friends boast of two or three lover a year and calculate their respective virus but almost as much coolness as the young men discussed the fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not af fall to marry
i hope maria baileys only think sir she added softly i could not bear to happen disappointed again
said fanny turning hope for all at once
suppose i say a word to time just inquired after his heart in a galway you know and give him the chance to tell me if there's anything that ter
bear it people always to par thing somehow answered polly looking as if sentence had been passed upon her
it was a very different window from the last bot the girls
if anny wanted to show him what she could do towards making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded ber than she suspected for in spite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mister sidney at least for he was more the house friend than ever and seemed determined approve the change of fortune made not difference to him
she kept much at home when the day's work was down finding it pleasantly to s dreaming of a book or so alone than to exert herself even to go to the shores
polly was not at all like herself that window and those nears to her so in wounded ed most
for ned was so absorbed in business that he excelled a whole baily question and left them in other darkness
fanny came broking in pony one day looking as if she poured tidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them
but if work baskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any re read
she had even been in society before the revolution
it was her pleasure and her vanity dragon these names on every pretext
every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monseigneur saint francois gave it to monsignor say julian monseigneur saint julian gave it to monseigneur saint e silius mur saints gave to monsignor sa procopius et set her et cetera
and the schoolgirls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under the bales charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers from
it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
the rule of pravo did not forbid this
she would not show the subject to anyone
thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were on occupied or bored in the convent
some unique chaplet some authentic relic
they lost themselves in conjectures
who the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making and effort fly but the dancers laughing with a satanic air

the expensive preserving them with sugar is a serious subjection for excepted sugar is used in considerable qualities the successes very uncertain

let it boil up again m take it off and move carefully the scum that his risen
it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil
before sugar was amused honey was employed the pres of many vegetable productions though this substance was now y wat to the juice of the sugar cane

bore them up three d successively stilling each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use
the reason let off this emptied out of the preserving pan into earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
from this example the process of preserving fruits by ser would be easily comprehended
they should be dried in the stove or of them on a seed and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they returned
in this way it is also that orange and woman ships are preserved
marmalades james and fruit pace of the same nature and by now fa general quest
mar maes and jams differ little from each other there preserves that half lilys sancy may by boiling the pulp of fruits i'm sometimes part of the wines with sugar
that they may keep it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen o three
in all the operations for preserve making when the preserving pains uses should not be placed on the fire but on a trib it unless the jam was meane on a hot plate when this is not necessary
confectionery fifteen o eight
in speaking of confectionery should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head for the various fruits flowers herbs risen jesus which one board with sugar were formally implanted in farm sey as well as a sweetmeats were called confections from the latin word confreres to make up but the term confectionery embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary
he thousand and wore ornamental dishes that had done the tables of the wealthy should re purchased from the confectioner they cannot profitably be made in home
however as late as the wing of our two last george's fabulous sums will often expended upon fanciful deserts
the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems

at deserts or at some evening parties ices are scarcely dispensed with

they should be taken immediately after repast or some hours after because the taking these substances dulling the process of digestion is apt to the look indisposition
there was one till the time the widower who had a sodden and the daughter by his first wife
from the v gave it the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the min's children and not a corner to be found what they to get any rest so the boy thought that the best thing he could do was stop pullo the world and try herne his own bread
but his sister who was still at home fared ward some worse
tis me go said b
when the king and turn and saw he stood still as if he were in fetters and could not stir from the spot for the picture seemed to him so beautiful
these promised to make all the haste he could and set forth from the king's palace
at last they came in sid of land
well if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her casket into the sea
what is my brother saying asked his sister again
on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchen maid who slept there to lend her a brush
she begged very prettily and got it and then she bushed her hair and the gold dropped from it
out along me agree bushy bribed sleeping so soft by the young king's side on send and stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with a cold snake unpitied and unwept
i shall come twice more and then never again said she
this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she s the bell gout three times and when day dawned she departed but if she was going she said as she had said before i shall come once more and then never again
no one can tell how the light of the king was to get rid of that hideous bush she bide and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as day itself
wilt th serve me and watch my seven fools as the king
the youth thought that it was very easy word to wash the holes and he could do well enough
hast thou watched faithfully and well the whole they long said the king when the lighted him into this presence in the evening
yes that i have said these
i had gone out once to seek a place he said but never would he do such a thing again
the ming promised in the same punishment and the same reward you a promised his brother
when he had run after the fools for a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by clef in a rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with the distaff and she called to him
come ever come hither my handsome son and let me comb your hair
the youth liked the thought of this let the hold one where they chose and seated himself in the clef of the rock by the side of the old hag
so then he sat with his head on her lap taking his ease the live long day
on the third day said the lad wanted the said e
the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go but all to know purpose cinder lad set out on his way
i am walking about and so to a place said sim lad
i would much rather have the princess said cinder lad
and thus they journeyed onwards a long long way
when they had gone thus for a long long way be full again or us dost th see anything n
yes now i see something that his white sits in the lad
it loos like a chalk of a great thick birch tree
signa ladd tried but could not do it so he had to take a doitherin there one more and after that still another and ming was able to be over sword with perfect ease
for we have brother said said the princess whom now are to have when thou kills tell the king what we eat and drink but there is a mighty toll whose has to spell over us
when they had tell it a long long way the full said dost g seeming thing
and now inquired the cole ceased nothing now

i have done my best replied slade
once upon the time there was a king in the north hope one many wars but now he was old
the old king went out and thought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
so yes the queen how do you know when the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning and she said
then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
he is no bigger than other dragon said the tutor and if you were very with your father you would not fear him
then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dwarf who wont all the treasure and took it from him
only one ring was left which the dwarf war and even that was taken from whom
so riggin made a sword and cigaret tried it with the blow in a lump of iron and the sword broke
then cigaret went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's blade and gave them to regin
so cigaret said that sword would do
then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley
but cigaret waited till half of him had called over the pit and then he thrust the sword graham right unto his very heart
syd said i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
but all men die and no brave man let's death frighten him from his desire
guy thou fafner and then safer died
then cigar grow back and met wakin and riggin asked him be roast factor's heart and let him taste of it
sins they could put the heart of fafner on mistaken roasted it
theres cigaret roasting fattens heart for another when he should taste it it himself and learn all wisdom
that let him do then ride over hin fell to the place where brunhild sleeps
there m she sleep till thou comes for her waking rise up in ride for now sure she will swear the vow fearless of breaking
then he took the helmet off the head of the sleep read behold she was a most beautiful lady
then cigaret rode away and he came to the house of the king who had a fair daughter
limber held father told gunner that she would marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower and that that they rode and gotter sit his horse at the flame but he would not face it
for one day when born hilding gub ronin were bathing born held waited farther sou into the river and said she did not to show she was hundreds superior
for her husband she said had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it
not long to wait he said till the bitter sword stands fast in my heart and thou will not live long when i am dead

i say replied sancho that i swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship stay in gone great i may be a little let it out tomorrow
though your worship was not badly off having your arsy a comparable beauty you spoke of but i what did i have except the heaviest wax that i think i had in all my life
unlucky me in the monet and bore me
didn't i say so worse luck to my line said sancho
it cannot be the more answered don quixote but those under enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone
if they do not let themselves be seen they let themselves be felt said sancho if not let my shoulder speak to the point
might speak too said don quixote but that is not a suspicion reason for believing that will we see ass he enchanted more
the officer turned room and said well how goes a good man
sancho got up with pain enough in his bones and went a to the ink bert in the dark in meeting the officer who was looking to see what have become of his enemy he said to him senor whoever you are d us to favor and kindness to give us little rosemary oil salt and white for it is water to cure one of our best nights errant on earth who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted more that is in this inn

the cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so low that they reached the ears of his master who appalling to listen attentively was persuaded that some new venture was coming until he clearly proceeded that it was his squire who uttered them
he saw him rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that had his rage loud him it is my belief he would have left
saunter took it and as he was raising into his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming sancho my son drink not water drinkin of my son for it will kill thee see here i had the blessed balsam and he held up ploska liquor and with drinking two drops what thou wilt certainly be restored
the strides of a lain man like the ogling glances of a one eyed man they do not reach their goal very promptly
cosette had waked up
jean valjean had paced her near the fire
you will wait for me at a lady's house i shall come to fetch ye
everything is ranged and nothing is said fourche lor
i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
that's where the difficulty lies
it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out
and she will hold her tome i answer for that
fauchelevent grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean
you understand father madden the government one notice it
jean valjean stared him straight toe i and thought that he was raving
for she li i went on
it is tomorrow that i am to bring you in the priors expensive
then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community
that the nun who had dined that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the fault under the altar of the chapel
that the priors and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil wish of the deceased
that he flush laval was to nail up the coffin in the cell raised the stone in the chapel and glower the corpse into the vault
and then that there was mummer the empty coffin
what is that anti coffin
asked jean valjean fourche lover replied
what coffin what administration
for lovell who was seated sprang up as though a alma had burst under his chair you
you knowd fort what you have said mother crucifixion is dead
and i add and father madeline is buried are
you are not by other men sa the madeline
this offers the means give me some information in the first pace
how long is the coffin six feet
it is a chamber on the ground floor has a grated window oping on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one needs into the convent the other into the church what church
that the church in the street of the church which anyone can enter
have you the kings to those toodles
no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the draw which communicates with the church
only to allow the undertakers men to enter when they come to get the coffin
who mails up the coffin by die
who spreads the poor labor it
not another man except the police doctor can enter the deed room that is even written on wall
cid you hid me in that ring to night whenever one is asleep
about three cork in the afternoon
i shall be hungry i i will bring you something
you can come a nail the up in the coffin at two o'clock
fuss live over recoiled and cracked his finger joints but that is impossible
ah impossible to take a hammer and drives nails in a plan
jean valjean had been worse straight the ms
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
to have himself nailed up a case and carried off like a ble of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to economize his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean's gloomy talons
you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will may on the top plan upon loosely good and what if you should happen to car for to sez
a man who is making his escape does not cough all sneeze
who is there who has not said to a cat do come in
the over prudent cats as they are and because they at cans sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
but chu val john's calmness prevailed over him in spite of himself he grumbled
if you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right i am sure of getting you out of the grave
an ol oar the old school the grat digger puts the corpses in grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
i shall follow that is my business
that's halts the undertaker men not a rope around your often flower you dam
the priests as the payers nates the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
one of two things will happen he will either be sob or he will not be sober
that is settled father fourche lovel all will go well
on the fallen day as the sun was declining the very rare passes by on the boulevard men hull off their hats to an old fashioned hearse ornamented with skulls class bones and tears
this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a hinge corpse with drooping arms
a morning coach in which could be seen a priest in his circles and a choir boy in his red cap followed
behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer and lumbered along
the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at might and winter in this cemetery they was subjected to a special discipline
these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalid
dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it
the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the vogue hard it hinted at poverty pat la shames if you peas
to be buried in perils is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognized as elegant
the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the introduction of jean valjean into the deed room all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch let us robing passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly vial offence in our sight
it is one of the faults which res on a duty
the nance had committed it not only without difficulty that even with the applause of their own consciences
in the cloister what is called the government is only an intermeddling with authority an interference which is always questionable
make as many laws as you please men but keep them for yourselves
a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
fable limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind
jean valjean's composure was one of those powerful tranquillity which are contagious
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
he played with father mista
he did what he liked with him he made him dance according to his whim
the permission for interment must be exhibited
he was a sort of laboring map who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a matter under his arm
the man replied the grey digger
the grave dinner yes
you i
father men is the brave digger he was
flush what had expected anything but this which a grave digger could die
it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do di themselves
he had hardly the strength to stammer
but he persisted feebly farther messire is the grave digger
do you know who little fatherland lars he is a jug of red wine
but youre a johnny fellow to
are you not comrade we'll go have a drink together presently
the man replied
he lump more out of anxiety than from infirmity
the grave digger walked on in front of him
fauchelevent passed the unexpected cava once more in review
fob who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
thir father nastia's dead
the man replied completely
the good god consulted his notebook which shows when the time is up it was father most hen's turn father misti and died
stammered fourche laval it is made
you are a peasant i am the parisian
threshing one fort i am lost
there were only a few churns of the wheel distant from the small ary leading to the nun's corner
and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well
fortunately the soil which was light and wept with the winter rains clock the wheels and retarded its speed
my father was a porter at the britonum timon
but he have reverses he had losses u changed i was obliged to renounce the profession of author but i am still a public writer
so you are not a grave digger then
returned fourche lovel clutching at as branch feeble as it was
here a remark becomes necessary
a fo was up his anguish offered a drunk but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
the grave digger went on with a superior smile
one must eat
the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake
yes but if i should already ask for something what
well do it for me for i swear to you thy don't love you as the others have loved you
there all bolts in the door wretch
i don't know how it is but it's ceased to mean if i do
now go i can't keep my eyes open
it seems to me as if this sleeping city belongs to me i searched my memory for the names of those whose happiness i had once envied and i could not recall one without finding myself the happier
education fly feeling the sense of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sents so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first castle of love all the more ardent because they seem so pure
the more girl believes in goodness the more easily will she give way if not to lover at least to love for be without mistrust she is without force and to win her love as a triumph that can be gained by any young men of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must be find it tempting how surely must be listen to the first voice which comes to tell it secrets through their bars and bless the hand which is the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil
with them the body has worn out the soul the senses half burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
they loved by profession and not by instinct
when a creature who has all her past to reproach herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere irresistible love of which she had never felt herself capable when she has confessed her love how absolutely the man whom she loves dominates her
they know not to what proof to give
in order to disturb the laborers in the field was one day devoured by a wolf because those whom he had so often deceived no long of the leaf in his cries for help
this is the same with these unhappy woman when the love seriously
but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one drought all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
but to return to the first day of maison
when i reached home i was in a state of mad gaiety
the woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him
how why
my whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night
here my orders tonight at the vaill
conde the third and tract
the boxes filled one after another
only w remained empty the stage box
at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and marguerite appeared
did she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she looks the happier i should eat
what is the magter with you tonight said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
you should go to bed she replied with that ironic error which went so well with a delicate and witty face
where at home
you still love me can you ask
because you don't like seeing him
then the less i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and marget into the carriage which was willing for them at the door
i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
you in the way marguerite but how
well you might have had a woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive
during this remark marguerite looked at me attentively
my dear prudence i answered you do not know what you are saying
yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
because i am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm
is that really the only reason
if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
honestly do you care for me a little a great feel
i fancied for a moment though i might give myself that happiness for six months you would not have it you insisted unknowing the means
well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
i listened and i gazed that marguerite with admiration
when i thought that this marvellous creature whose feet i had once longed kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts by part in her life and that i was not yet content with what she gave me i asked if ma's desire had indeed limits when s spied as probably as mine had been it reached after something further
truly she conceded we poor creatures of chance have fantastic desire and inconceivable loves
we are not allowed to have hearts and the planty of being h down and of ruining our credit
we no longer belong to ourselves
we stand first in their self sustained last in esteem
never do give you advice which is not lucrative
it me little enough to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they get dresses or a brace land out of them and that they can drive and our para from time to time or come to our box at future
such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and old age neither protects nor consoles
i thought i could accept the life which he offered me what would you have
what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
marguerite hired out with this long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough pull up her the chief to her lips and from that to her eyes
marguerite do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but the name of heaven tear up the letter which i wrote to you and do not mad me leave you to morrow it would kill me
marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile infinite sweetness said
here it is i have brought the back
i tore letter into fragment and kissed a tears the hand that ga it to me
look here prudence do you know what he wants said marguerite
he wants you to forgive him
one has too but he wants more than that what then
i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled
all mister buzzard grinned
this sounded like another story
he was curious about that black headed cousin of all mister buzzard very curious indeed
anyway he would pin out
please mister bells are please tell us the story he begged
now all mister buzzard is naturally good natured and accommodating and when peter bagged so hard he just couldn't find it in his heart to refuse

everybody looked at peter and laughed
so weirs set on the chimney toms whenever o jack poser guess to straining down where he had no business
one day this no count's trifling cousin of grand pop buzzard get cold in his feet
it was on the little old house and there old tumble down house

but he don't mind that
oh youll please speak a low louder he hollowed out the chimney just like that
yes sah she sure he was plump scared
they liked to choke that no comport to death
when he get home he ty tri ba suit off but it done get into the skin and it stay there
a little sigh of satisfaction went round the circle of listeners
it was just as good as one of grandfather frogs
drawer wee fill mix give it me without water

wile there was rather surly after the ladies had floated away from the scene and he drank his liquor doggedly
it was his fancy i suppose to revive certain sentimental relations which had it may be once existed between him and mis lake and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnified an object in proportion as its pursuit is thwarted
the story of friedlin and wretches pretty outlines
sit down beside me and i'll tell you the story
he assisted at it but took no part and in factor was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gabble in laughter like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance
but honest mark forgot that young ladies do not always come out quite alone and jumped unassisted into their vehicles
but the middle sun was little in lorn he was neither dark nor fair he was neither handsome nor strong
rowing himself on his knees before the king he cried oh royal sire the still upon me also a sword in a steed that i may up in away to follow my brethren
but the king laughed him to scorn thou a sword he quoth
in sooth thou shalts have one but it shall be one befitting thin maiden size and courage y so small a weapon can be found in all my kingdom
forthwith the grinning juster began sure eking with laughter so that the bells upon his motley cap were all s a jangling
i did but laugh to think the sword of elite had been so quickly fowl responded the jester and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailor's girdle
one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes
thou shalt have thy liberty he cried even though thou shouldst run me in pieces the moment thou art free
yet had it suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful vy with filmy winds which shone like rainbows in the moonlight
at this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten
scissors grow a giant's he and save us from y ogre's might
he could see the ogre standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the chasm and gnashing his teeth each one of which was as big as a mill still
his sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him
thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this dismal s bought while i have the power to help thee
he lifted the scissors and with one stroke d strode the web and gave the flights read e
a think glimmer of light on the opposite w shows me the keyhole
the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to thinken a suitable verse to say to the scissors
as he uttered the words the scissors looped out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shutters as easily as through it cheese
in a very short time the prince had crawled to the opening
while he stood looking around him and bewilderment a firefly alighted down his arm flashing its little land in the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me to guy doe to a place of safety
what is to become of me cried the poor peasant
my grain must fall and rot in the field from over ripeness because i have not the strength to rise and harvested then indeed must we all starve

among those who drew back where et reaches brothers the three that were dark and the three that were fair
but elite he did not their tops
so they all cried out long and loud long of the prince prince is all
he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn opened with the iron in order that grain may be deposited within it it feels only the wound the quiver of the germ the joy of a frat only arrived later
he'd thought just acquired a safe must he then rejected already
he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
to stand between two religions from one of which you would not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to that like souls
marius was clear eyed and he required the true light
the half light of doubt came him
whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
his discomfort was augment by all the reflections which occurred to him
in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
they soon elbowed him abruptly
request co fact to come and talk with me said marius
what is to become of you said cur fac
what are you going to do i do not know
silver gold here it is
you will then have only a pair of trousers a weskit a hat and a coat and my boots
that will be enough
no it is not good what we do after that
do you don't german no
it is badly paid work but one can li by it
the close dealer was sent for
he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments they went to the watchmakers
he bought the watch for forty five francs
hello i've forgotten that said marius
the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot
i have ten francs left said marius
that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sous very slowly
one morning on as return from the los school marries found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistol that is to say six hundred francs and gold in a sealed box
marius sent back the thirty louis to aunt with the respectful letter in which he stated that he had suspicious means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his knees
at that moment he had mew franks left
he perceived that it was no good talking to the old m and that the principal person in the house was the mother
before her he decides as cater his pearls
the princess was distracted and did not know what to do she felt she had sinned against kitty
well doctor decide our faith said the princess tell me everything
he's their hope she meant to say but her lips quivered and she could not out of the question well doctor
as he wass the princess went out with the sigh
the family doctor respectfully ceased middle of his observations
and there are indications metricians nervous excitability and so long
the question says thus in present of indications of turco process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
yes sets an understood thing responded the celebrated physician again waning in his watch
beg pardon is the usk grid dia or shall have the drave
he asked ah it is
o well then i can do it in twenty minutes
and how about at tour abroad asked the count doctor
what is wanted is the means of improving attrition enough lowering
the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
but in favor foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling a premises
and then the mother wishes it he had
ah well not hast to be sure lo and go only those grun inca are mischievous
oh times up already and he went to the door
the created doctor announced to the princess a feeling if what was due from him v pated his doing so that he ought to see the patent once more
oh no only a few det years princess come way
and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing groom to kitty
when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with years
she answered in and all at once got up furious
excuse me doctor ab there is really no logic in this
this is the thir time you've asked me the same thing
the celebrated doctor did not take offence
nervous servility he said the princess when she had left the room however i had finished
and the doctor began sides the vic they explaining the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certain the harness
at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged ino dew meditation as though resolving a weighted brabble
finally his decision was bounced they were to go abroad but to put no fate in foreign flax and to elated him and any need
it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had young
the mother was much more cheerful w she went back to her daughter and kitty regain to be more cheerful
educated equal of the upper places are trying to stifle ever brewing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social b
this is absolutely in direct
in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the enterest of the group
the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but disconnection is quite impossible
the men who is controlled by moral influence acts and accordance with his own desires
the basis of authority is bodily vials
the possibility of applying bodily violence the people is provided above all by an organisation of armed men trained to act in unison and submission to one will
these bands of armed men said missa to a single will are re constitute the army
the army has always been and still hear the basis of power
power is always in the hands of those who control y army and all ment in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything can court popularity in the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
indeed it could not be otherwise
only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
but since this is not the case and on the contry men and power always far from being sins through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
even if there was w a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition amen of violence the existence of an authority to restrain such vileness was an advantage because the violence of the government was less than the violent of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
between the members of one state subject to a single authority the stride between the individual seemed still less and a life of the state seems even more secure
it was produced on one hand by the natural growth the population and on the other by struggle and conquest
after conquest the power of the emperors puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
but this justifications never more than temporary
internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression deserted by the authority over the dissentient individuals
govern authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in reported to the duration and strength of the government
and therefore the oppression of the oppress always goes on growing up the furthest women beyond which it cannot go ab killing the goose with the gold nice
the most convincing example this is be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient time subdued that conquest
so it h always been
foot nut this fact that in america the uses of authority exist in spite of a small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position to positively confirms with
the upper class know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be in sufficient and no longer belong on incitants men they feel their this scurry of their position depends on the increase drink of the army
the reason to which he gave expressions essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the pops engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of to day so carefully distribute the repute so that the regiments from the frontier there stationed and central districts and the regiments from the centre are stationed on the frontiers
the meaning of creevy speech put into plain language is that funds are needed not toss foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the in slave toiling masses
and this abnormal order of thanks is maintained by the army
but there is not only one omen there other governments exporting their such as by violent in the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its in slave subjects
and so every government needs an army also to product its booty from its neighbor brigands
this increases contagious as montescue pointed hundred fifty years ago
every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defence against its subjects becomes a sort of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
the despotism of the government always increases with the strength of the army and as external successes and the egg restiveness of a government increases with its internal despotism
the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers who obtained at the least possible express
and by this means all citizens are under arms support the iniquities practised upon them all citizens have become their own impress us
this inconsistency has become obvious and universal thar service
in fact the whole significant of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitory personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life the groups of persons
but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had meet to avoid
but inst of doing that they exposed to individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting strike with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors
the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorbed the grave depart in the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
the danger of war ever ready to break gal winners all reforms of li social like vain and fruitless
with the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
government assert that armies are new above all for external defence with that is not true
they are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universe military serves that comes an accomplice in all that acts of violence are the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
and for the sake of what are making them
i'm expected for the sake of a states to mak the sacrifices to revery thing that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
excepted the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish the number that that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence
so that the justification of stained violence on the ground of the protection and gives us from evil dispose persons even if it had some foundation three of four centuries ago has none whatever now
except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means a punic soul
without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything
this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in formic societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
without governments nations were be in slay by their neighbors
the government they tell us with its army is necessary defend from neighboring states who might in slave us
and if defence against barbarous nations is meant one thousand part of the troops now under ars would be ay sufficient with that purpose
the power of the state far from bringing a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes us on the contrary the much greater danger of such attacks
even looking at practically weighing that is to say all the birds laid on him by the states no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with a state demands and servant the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantages than to refuse to do so
to resist what need independent thought a effort of which every man is not capable
so much for the advantages of disadvantages both lines of conducts for a man of the wealthy class and oppressor
for a man of the poor working clots the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with the great increase of disadvantages
say you now supper
chris looked from medical plated flash like to a car jack c spar plug
no one's a job ban that's jackie harris
o k he said
only why didn't ask him yourself
mike became uneasy and fished in mastic band out of his pocket made a flick of paper and sent its soaring out and em street
well hand mitted i did
chris asked and for the first time that day the heavy wit he carried within him lifted and who lightened the little
thy really meets it in pursue
he would have liked to get the jaw for jakie needed it that somehow the task of facing mister wicker especially now did the light was going and dusk edged into the streets was not what christen intended for ending the afternoon
mike's expression changed on what once to one of triumphs but brisk was only parsley encouraged
pitcher and' go it after all this turned to in him
might was standing on the corner
oh shocks
christ it off once more passing a bleak little victorian church perch on hill of mister wicker's house
an empty lot cut in into by church lane gave look of isolations of ale shape brick building it sir mister wicker's both house and place at business
the longer wing toward the back got back door that opened on a water street the space between the house and the guns and au had been made into a meat up along the flower garden fenced off for the sidewalk by box shrugs in a white picket fence
a livid yellow stained of arise ino in the factories and glad clouds lowered and tumbled above
the air was growing chill and christ decided the finished the job
all at once he wondered how his mother was and everything in aven pinched and tightened itself
at the foot of the hill he reached the house
there were three things that always caught his eye amant the litter of dusty pieces
or the left the coil of rope in the centre the model of a sailing ship in a grain glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of the negro boy and banging trousers turkish jacket and white turban
but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe at home in bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabel to
he had never seen any one' go into mister hooker's shock now he thou a bed
how then biding lin and what did ever sell
a sudden car horn walking from his dream
and the many times he examined mister refers window and poured over the rope the ship and the nubian boy he had never gone into mister hooker's shop
some now alone till someone should answer the bell they looked eagerly yet uneasily around him to
what with one window the lower in tee outside the long narrows shoot with sombre
head the hand un beams crossed it from one side to the other
mister's back being toward the source of light chris could not see his face
the double fans a minute wrinkles breaking from eye cry to temple and joining with those over the sheep bones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the dome forehead
lyell toss some white funds above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarians hair but what drew and held chris's gaze with the old men's eyes
crisp blinked to look again yes they were still there
chris swallowed it wise came back to
y sir he said
i set your sign and i know boy who eats the job
he's a schoolmate min
jagga harris's name is new reeling is the charm
i i just wonder if the poise was to lop and
what he saw was a fresh cheap lad tall for thirteen sturdy wincey in good humour in his face and something sent it in an appealing about his eyes
he guess there must be a lively fire from that room beyond
would that have fear with jakie gig skinning the job sir
but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mind why do he not see the reflection of the headlights at the cars moving ab around the carrier of wall under street up the hill towards the epics signals
the rome seemed overly still
then in that second d turned and faced about
the wide bowin it was there before him three objects he liked best showing frost in the moonlight that poured in from a cross of water
chrystal water what was the free way
it was no longer there nor with a high walls and smoke stacks of factories to be seen to
but warehouses were still there
flabbergasted and breathless christ was unaware that he had moved closer appear out the window and every direction
no electric signs no lapt streets
when the people's drove store and stood but half an hour before rose the ruse of what was evidently and in
a courtyard is firstly light by flaring torture too shilling a swinging side hung on the post
the posts plighted at the edge of it was now prod and money road
the coach when had stopped piled hive with lugged stamped to a halt beside the flight court card
they moved into the end the coach rattled off to the stale
my window has a pow for those few who are to see
the learning of magic was pin means easy
he told hiss master at once he got simon gosling his horde of money his hiding places for it
chris therefore threw himself and of all the primaries in his task
one afternoon when he had returned after a rest to mister winter's study he saw that there was something new in the room a ball with a gold fishin it stood on the table but mister worker not to be seen
what sh all i do first
how you improved my boy he exclaimed it is now time for you to try missus is good a change any
supposer changed and kat back
mister worker went and patiently bided for a few moments for christ to get up his courage
then is nothing happened with a voice like a whip mister wicker said stated once
a sensation spread faster and faster
his head swab and he felt faint little sick but he persisted through the final words
he thought nor without a feeling or pride and comments his experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight some little time lap before mister wicker's voice boom bows by
seventy four book one the return
the figure shoes carved in caster and style a curved up pointing toes
that all at once the idea came to chris
if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
he squatted on his haunches examined the carved wooden figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion
but how did one change inanimate to nen of it
gris got up and stole back to mister wicker's door
he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his rome above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was reeling empty with sir june's proper shape and opened the doors of the cupboard the far end of the room
the afternoon raining before increased in storm
thus came two hours before its time thunder snarls in the sky
certain elements were be mixed and poured the proper time
mister worker began moving about upstairs the full boards creaked way and still chris could not leave until the face fumed and glowed
with infinite caution chris closed the doors silently behind him in running light before wards breached the figure at the negro boy
it was as at the stiffness melted
under his eyes wen folds of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its rounding upon the coat and oh the face
the wind grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of car flowers moved bouquet fall
they went down to their corners first
guess mister finney went to his quarters i don't number seeing him cross the decker come over that way at all
next ned silly was ring into the helm by over jones it took over ned went on down
it looks to me as if it could been and one of several people and i'll be switched i know who when give my eyes open
the mabel was nearing teddy
we've fought her in fresh stalls to tick o m
chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down his cabin
certainly my boy boomed out the captain as blue eyes abruptly keen and penetrating
mister finney would be some time on deck we cannot be own heard in here
his face rose with nervousness that this might do l do was in answer and he stood stiff and stone before captain blizzard
my captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
then he s well i do not care for it i cannot say i do
this ship had more to me than wife or mother all family
pause fingering this lower lip the looking sideways in an afflicted fashion at chris standing before him
we shall say no more but i trust you understand the responsibility you have
the ship its cargo in its men will be in your hands
yes sir i think i can do it safely or i should not try sir
captain lizards round pink faced creased in its winning smile
you then went on to describe what else was to follow the covering in the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
the cam flush was not a word the captain or anyone else of his time he had understood
what can be said during that time sir christ thought ask
i am somewhat skill in merit ments i have to be as a captain of ship and crew know it
i shall say that you are in my own cabins i can care for you
not since he had left mister wicker and chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
he knew now that his absence for as long as he had ed to be away would be covered up and satisfactorily accounted for to
their conversation had taken some little while
when churchyards yon
i knew well enough that he might be carr it thousand the miles and box car locked in perhaps without water or full

leaving a sleeping sleep of the just when i went upstairs and i haunted out my thing scaly
they were chucking confidently together but when they came down they ceased
there were a few preparations to be made logs to be gone over winters instructive as to renew vigilance and then after distinguishing the whole light re crept in the darkness thon door and into the night
i asked no questions
was only somebody spoke and then it was an emphatic with the profanity from doctor steward where he ran into a wire fence
i only know what i expected
the doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt
i profess that just at that minute even sun aside seeded cheerful spot
in spite of myself i dreamed roughing sharply

bright and matty with a chins goods and the little toil had set out not inelegant and her bed by thing golf bench asleep on his perch with his bit of sugar between the wise of a gage her billow so white and unpressed with its little edging of lace
when he came back to the drawing room a totty bought hoole of all the gloom in his hand with her lace handkerchief he bathed her temple and forehead
there was nothing very brotherly in his look as they peered into a bale sharp features during the process
there don't mind me she said sharply and getting a she looked down at her dress and finches and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle he had just sat down and went spi to her room
and she threw back oval and going hardly to the dooryard mechanically survey herself him at lass
rachel le latently what are you know

he slackened the space and tapped sharply at the little window of the madest post office at which the young ladies in the bony carriage had pulled up the day before and within which looked wagged was won to sleep in a sort of wooden box that folded up and appeared to be a chest of drawers all day

the acts said that he is of difference of at thin there must be about
he went up to the table and striking it with his fingering he shouted loudly about
he was shouting for the very course searching ivanovitch had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and dow opposition tow the same indicted ness though in a more seemly fall on the other side
shouts were receded and for a moment all his confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order ballad
we shed up blood for our country
the confidence of the monarch with no shaking the accounts of the martian he's not of cashier but that's another point
votes please peace
they expressed the most implacable hatred
levin did not in the least understand what was a matter and he marvelled at the passion with which it was disputed whether not the position above flare off should be put to the vote
he forgot as sir ivanovitch explained to him afterwards this slices that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that to gether to the martian it was necessary to have a majority of words that to get a majority of boards it was necessary to secure fer write to about that to secure the recognition of ferox wit bot they was decide on the interpretation to be put on the act
but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he added respect in such an unpleasant ambitious state of excitement
to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters a the freshman bar
he particularly liked the way one gree whiskered waiter who showed u gone for the other younger was and was dured at by them was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly
levin advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much evaded he turned to soe even image with the question where the mort to put it
solid even ach ground
that is a matter for each man's own decision he said severely
having put it e he recollected that he ought have thrust his left hand too and so he trusted though too lid and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasted retreat into the bad ground
a hundred and twenty six for admission ninety eight against

then there was a laugh a button and two knots were found in the box
but the old party to dot consider themselves conquered
indo plies met coves spoke of the trust and nobleman of the province had placed to him the aheating they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service
this expression in the martials face was particularly touching to leven because only the day for he had been at his house about his trusty business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kind hearted fatherly man
if there o men younger and more deserving th i let themself
and the marshal disappeared through a side door

he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening tow was being said around him

these persons were unmistakably staking a place where they could talk without ping overheard
shall be go on your excellency fine champing

oh still just the same always are loss the landowner answered with a resigns mine o with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be
why what is there to understand
there's no many it at all
then two one must keep of connections
it's a marble obligation of a sort
and then to tell tut there's one's own in fs
their pro plans of as sort but rear the landowners
that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
and we are laying out a garden climbing one before the house you know and there you have a tree that stood the centuries in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you don't cut down the old fellow to make him for the flowerbeds but lay out your beds so as to take a wantage of the
well and hows your land doing
but one's work astor in for nothing
oh well one does it what would you have
and once more the landowner went on leaning his elbows in the window and chatting on my son i muste has no days for it
so there will be no one to keep it out and yet one dozes
we've walked about the fields and the gunmen no said he stiff this livid even things well looked after put your gardens neglected
to mine thinking i'd cot down the landy
hear your thousands of lines and each would make two good fellows a park
you married i heard said the landowner
yes it's job the strange he went on
the landor are chuckled under his white and stars
why don't we cot down our box for two
said levin returning to her thought that had stock him
there's a class instinct to of what one ought an ought nod
there's the peasants too a wonder of them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
without a return too at a simple loot
when he came from the bath plus visited him again
but harmon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honor of the seventieth birthday of the old sculptor eu fray
she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour
so the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition
the banquet was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day passed without seeing daffy and telling her the words of the oracle
he longed with ardent yearning for the sounder her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescue demeter might yet be the work of merciless had again mastered him
the approval as well as a doubts which had arise in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts
then he went directly to the neighbouring palace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered an impossible to give him even a hints of the conspiracy
when hermon entered the residence of the grammaticus in the palace the guests had already assembled
the place by harmon's side which eta had chosen herself would then be given up to arsenal
true an interesting conversation still had powered to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight u referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyment as blindness debarred him
a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and woman to whom no tad bound him save the presence of the same host
creates had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair haired nio had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing ar sins praises among his professional associates
his son had been the royal dame's first husband and she had deserted him to marry lis mus the aged king of thrace
the king's sister the object of his love cried hermon incredulously
we woman are only as old as we look and the lee's entire woman of this beauty of forty practise arts which give her the appearance of twenty five yet perhaps the king values her intellect more than her pison and the wisdom of a hundreds serpents is certainly united in this woman's head
the three most trustworthy ones a here aus the liege chrysippus in the admirable process
let us hope that you will make this three leaved clover the luck promising four leaved one
your uncle too has often with praise worthy generality helped a know in many in embarrassment
how long he kept waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the hall city with delight
when he did finally summon he fet things which must have wounded you
that is going to far replied hermon
he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arsenal had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in rods
the a royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and al thea eagerly confirmed the statement
her maam meno the parent silence
the roan was just beginning to praise arsenal also as a special friend and connoisseur of the sculptures art when crates her mons fellow student asked the blind artist and behind of this beautiful companion why his demeter was placed upon a pedestal which to others as well as himself seemed too high for the size of the statue
yet what mattered hit even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of score at him
a woman who earns for the regard of all men and makes love a toy easily lessens the demand she imposes upon individuals
only even though love hash wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and anthea did not wish to lose harmon's regard
how indifferent to look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you was still a genuine great and artist the case was different
tho so loud a denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no illusion and snows me i can prove
it was nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
not a sound if you value your lives
to offer resistance would have been madness for even harmon perceived by the loud clanking of weapons round them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prison the place of execution
was he to be led to the executioner's block
what pleasure had liked to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art
ought he not to greet his sen end as a boom from the immortals
did it not spare him a humiliation is great and painful as could be imagined
whatever might await him he desired go better fate
if he had passed into annihilation he herman wished to follow him thither an annihilation certainly meant reduction from pain and misery
but if he were destined to meet his virtuous and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not tell them how sure he was finding a joyful reception there from both
the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was n nemesis no it was a kindly deity
yet it was no illusion that deceived him
again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
sometimes with touching entreaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philips her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
cried herr mud in grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and followed the soldier whom the captain detail to guide her into the palace
to morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to the dangerous path
daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philip's silenced tar with a grave exclamation the order of the king
as soon as the captive artist was alone with the woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forth incoherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly returned the pressure he could not restrain the desire to class purge was heart
in spite of his deep mental distress he could have shouted aloud in this delighting gratitude
he might now have been permitted to find forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the pullest of the following morning still sealed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought not to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impulse he exclaimed you know that i love you
i love you and have loved you always
daly exclaimed tenderly what more is needed
but harmon with trooping head murmured to more i shall no long of bee what i am now
then af you raced her face to his asking so the demeanors the work and myrtles
put a terrible or deal again awaits you
and i fool planted also mine could be vexed with you for it
bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it if you consent with a time arrives to become conceal in palliate nothing
so our ki is intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day
he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
his heart contrasted painfully it is solicitude about his uncle's fate increase when philips in warmed him that the conspirators had been arrested at the banquet anu headed by ames the rhodium chrysippus am process had perished by the executioner's sword at sunrise
besides he knew that the objects his love would not part from him without granting him one mast word
on the way his hard throbbed almost bursting
even after these image and what threatened her father and her with him re seated far into the background
he was appearing before his companions only to give truth it's just to
the egyptian o bay and his master crossed the wide space strewn with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the feal performances even had his eyes retain the power of sight his blood was coursing still widely through his fins that he might perhaps have been unable to distinguish the statues around him and the thousands of spectators who crowded closing together richly garlanded their chiefs galling with enthusiasm surrounded the arena hermon
shouted his front silas and joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk harmon
even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeter he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithful to his art and his nature
honour to myrtle us and his art but he trust at the snow feast ill assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception and a his prayer for recovery

we must have gone the stones

the first stone is that matter substance cannot be this for you cannot be united
is this corn thales our facts it follows as an necessity that matter and force are from e two eternity that they come neither be increased nor diminished
it follows that nothing hath been or can be created that there never has been or can be a creator
it followed that there could not have been any intelligence andy designed back of matter and force

we know the paths that life has travelled
we know the footsteps of advance they have been praised
four thousands of years men and women have been crying to reform the world
why have reformer save
they depend on the lor on luck and charity
they leave by fra and vs and bequeaths to their julian
failure seems to be the train mark of nature why
nature produced without purpose sustains without intention and destroys without faults
master world forever remain victim of ignorant passion
why should men and women have children that they cannot take care of children that are burden and curses why
passion is and always has been death
you can punish but it can neither reform criminals nor prevent crime
this cannot be done by talk or example
this is the solution of the whole question

the two monsters took off their shoes and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses
by means of this stratagem they followed so closely that although within a few steps of sarn tom they did not hear them
sarah and her brother having again passed by the ty frog arrived close to the dilapidated house which was partly in ruins and its open cellars formed a kind of gulf along which the street ran in that direction
in an instant the schoolmaster with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized seated with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling the into this hale

france who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to of it's request but at once accompanied him to the desired spots and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon
my very good friend and excellent neighbour replied the count with a smile you really inciter my trifling exertions
my father the comte deem morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and mad and i u hesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal
i can scarcely credited

so be it then replied the counts and extending his hand or the calenders suspended near the chimneypiece he said to days the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o'clock now promise me to remember this and expect me that twenty first of me at the same hour in the forenoon
i residing my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the father's sight of the courtyard and ty separated from the main building

then we shall not meet in paris
i fear i shall now have hour
well since we must part said the count holding out her hand to each of the young man allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey
what is the matter asked albert of france when they had returned to their own apartments you see more than commonly thoughtful
i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
did you ever meed him previously to coming hither
upon my honour th lenten me
he dwelt with considerable false and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the bottle of the thousand and one nights he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof our trace of all these events saved the small yor seen in the distant arisen driving under full sale tow portal
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the banded peppino an engagement wedge as our readers o aware he most faithfully fulfilled
but said franz the can bandit that were among the crew of his vessel
why really the thing seems to me simple enough
talking of countries replied france of what countries the counts what is his native tomb wes does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life life as marvellous as alone that hat tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and blooming and his
certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered
my dear france replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the counts assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend i that the morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him
what are his means of existence what is his both place of what countries a native
i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from hands of senior pampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outwards appearance of ease and and concern i did not very particularly care to remain
and this time it must be confessed that contra of the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all an albert's side
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation
and now my dear franz let us talk of some else
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert the morcerf would follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge store and which merits a particular description
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and caught these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate
a a quarter ten avaled entered he composed with a little room nam john and who warmly spoke english all albert's establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the counts chair also

it is for that reason you seem so early
i returned home at day break and strove to sleep but my head ached and i gossiped to have a ride for an hour
pests i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find theme separable
besides that does not concern the home but the financial department
about what about the papers
and the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders
they say that it is quite fair and that sewing so much rare you ought to read a little blue
come come that is not bad said lucia
with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years
the gentleman had not have im needed to sit down to become interested apparently he had taken up the volume from a table as soon as he came in and standing there a for a single glance ran the apartment had lost himself in his pages
that has an unflattering sound for mee said the young man
she is win to ris that
just as on am the visitor inquired presenting himself with mother a where could day aspect
he was tall went lean and dress throughout in black his shirt collar was low and wide and the triangle of linen a little trampled exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat was adorned by you pin complaining a small red stone
in spite of this decoration the young man looked poor explore as a young maned look who had such a fine hed and such magnificent eyes

lusted his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair
gad explained the colonel
the very pair i was going to buy
look here colonel do you know anything about this
and the detective professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
i happened to see those candlesticks in the window of single fronts shop the other day and i made up my mind to buy them when i had a chance
now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen
thot i don't know whether that's his first his last name anyhow he had a par or named sherley
anyhow he in fronted get along very well it seems
neighbors often heard him scrapping along and his half to noon they went at it again aw and heavy
toward dark a man went into buy a lamp
he found the place without a lighted stumbled over something on the floor and there was all e's body with the head busted in in this heavy candle sticker it
sure held so tight we could h to get it out
maybe the fright was about who on the watch for the dagoes talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were say i see
and the watch have you it yes oar
that's the watch announce the headquarters detective reaching in for it going yet see
you're not a scream wishes all that are you just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's
and doni it's voice was plainly sceptical

and i've read enough about germs to know the danger i'd advise you to be careful
if you don't mind i should like to examine this a bit
before the big wind and ireland suggested thong with a nodded desirous compatriot slightly to have the colonel
that's rout agreed the colonel as it continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
and a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece but poked it about and touched it here and there were the end of a lead pencil
and donn take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free within
has the surprise detective yes
don't scratch yourself on it whatever you do why not
simply because this watch
somewhat out her to see you
all i be here in a second
singa fut was the panting answer
i want to talk over darcy's case with you the colonel had said and the two had talked had thought had talked again and now were silent for a time
what are the choices of getting him off legally if we go righted from a negative standpoint asked the colonel
rather i pathetic question colonel but i should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition
at best he would get off with the scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn't want that nor do i
and you i don't wanted either
but i want to know just where we stand now i know
but i need to do a little more smoking out first now i want to think
if you'll excuse me i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may ketch something
in fact i have a feeling that ill land my fish
i'd recommend him to you instead of blackstone thanks lapped kenneth
what it perhaps i can help you
the old adage of two head you know
yes it's still holes good
no rale mony replied the colonel puzzled yes just that
and there's no reason you should know
chuckled the colonel as he skilfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook
and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip in now limp fish into the creels colonel gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
the reason she asked no alimony inquired kenneth
no i wasn't thinking of that
however don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough fort day
well i don't know that you can
it isn't generally know went on the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him
it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating graduate into that of a baser sort
you don't mean the large struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did
the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him
aaron grafton statement was being unexpected great confirmed
he remembered that cynthia and grafton had once been in la with each other
she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer
because large made no defense
large by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
so i had to let her have her way and m ja asked the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel fee
no but he will or i'll sole and get judgment oh he'll pay all right
and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up
still i would like to know
the murderer of missus darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweler was tried
it had a double reputation shall to speak
grave and even reverend the conventions assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper if not better class were fig seen in its dining room or cafe
large himself was a peculiar character
in a smaller place he would have been called a solemn keeper
and it was this man rich over said handsome certainly that cent the a retford had married
to this was the answer whispered money
and in a way was true
she also sawed opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges
after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the larch hotel it could hard to be called home became the scene of many festivals
then it was s of large that soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat hiss wife with refined cruelty that hidden away from the public underneath his habitual matter there was the wrongness of the brute
but it was noticed that the older in more conservative families were less off on represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smart o who had not yet acquired any and more rolling to take a chance
it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me in the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as o the judges and members of the bar to be seen there cannot explain to the colonel
meanwhile colonel ashley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he saw darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something to be done always returned the answer
don't worry you will come out all right
i'm going to rectify them but i will take time
it's hard from hiss mason too although shes bearing up like a major
so king god bale who put it up
it was hy larch
they too harry away while ago
but he is a pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same
only that i darcy hesitated and grew red
good evening colonel he called gie will you draw me in a wells rabbit
thank you no
i'm afraid my digestion isn't quite up to that as i had to cut out my fishing of late
now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder
the stopped clocks for instance have you any theory
there were three of them the centre figure being d of harry king and he was very much intoxicated
that is not always but sometimes it happened to be so now
i beg your pardon he said in the countered tones he know so well how to use yet of which he made so low use of late
i said where have you been remarked gether we've missed you
i said i was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort
by polonius someone asked
because de friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks to much but who is not so wise as he thinks
there was a rattle of coin on the mahogany bar as king sou to disentangle a single bill from the water up currency at his pocket
it's it's an odd coin an old roman one that missus darcy had inter private collection kept in the jewelry door safe was the whispered answer
i went over them near the day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed
that was her went on the jour

then i took up a great stone from among the trees and coming up to him smote him therewith on the head with all my might and crushed in his skull as he lay dead drunk
behold a ship was making for the island through the dash and sea and flashing waves
hearing this i was saw troubled remembering what i had before suffered from the ape kind
upon this he bought me a cotton bag and given it to me said take this bag and fill it with paddles from the beach and go forth with a company of the townsfolk to whom i will give a charge respecting thee
do as they do and belike thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land
then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pebbles
to these he committed me commend in me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how together that he may get his daily bread and you will earn your rewards in recompense in heaven
now sleeping under these trees were many apes which when they saw us rose and fled from us and swarmed up among the branches whereupon my companions began to pled them with what they had in their bags and the apes fell to plucking of the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk
we weighed anchor and shahrazad perceived the dawn of the day and ceased saying o permitted say
when it was the five hundred and fifty ninths night
and ceased not sailing till we arrived safely at b sara
there i abode a little and then went on to bagdad r entered my quarter and found my house and foregathered with my family and saluted my friends it gave me joy of my safe return and i laid up all my goods and valuables in my storehouses
after which i returned to my old merry way of life and forgot all i had suffered in the great prophet and gain i had made
next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawn prayer and after blessing mohammed the cream of all creatures betook himself to the house of sinbad the seaman and wished him a good day
here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales therein
happily amongst you is one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up and all th everything on board of her were plunged into the sea
but it burneth in their bellies so they cast it up again and it can jal on the surface of the water whereby its color and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it ashore and the travellers and merchants who know it collected and sell it
each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides and after little the rest of my fellows perished one by one till i had buried the last of the party and boat alone on the island with but a little provision left i who was wont to have so much
but there is majesty and there is no might save in alla the glorious the great
when it was the five hundred and sixty first night
then signed for myself i set to work collecting a number of pieces of chinese and corner and aloes wood and i bound them to gather with ropes from the wreckage then i chose out from the broken up ships straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the allows wood making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel of the stream and i tied it tightly and firmly as though it were nailed
land after land shalt thou see can find but no other life on thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul and thy thoughts a night or woes shall lend or sooner or late
i rode my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried the raft with it down the underground channel
and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft by reason of the narrowness of the channel whilst the stream ceased not to carry me along knowing not night from day for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me about in my terror and concerned for myself lest i should perish
when i awoke at last i found myself in the light of heaven and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft moored to an island in the midst of a number of indians and abbas inanes
but i was delighted at my escape from the river
when they saw i understood the night and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace be with thee o my brother
o my brother answered he we a husbandman untill of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding thee asleep on this raft laid hold of it and made it fast by us against thou shouldest awake at thy leisure
i answered for o lad's sake and my lord ere i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after ask me what thou wilt
when it was the five hundred and sixty second night
she said it ath reached me our auspicious king that sinbad the seaman continued when i landed and found myself amongst the indians and absents and had taken some rest they consulted among themselves and said to one another there is no help for it but we carry him with us and present him to our king that he may acquaint him with his adventures
so i consorted with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respect
so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing to set out with the merchants for that i pined after my people and mine own land
quoth he thou art thine own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us on o head ni be it for thou gladden us with thy company
by allah are my lord answered i thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with thy favours and well doings but i weary for a sight of my friends and family and native country
then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchants fore said
he asked me whence they came and i said to him by allah a commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way thither
for state processions a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant eleven cubits high and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks on his right hand and on his left
his letter hath shown me this and as for the mightiness of his dominion thou hast told us what thou hast die witnessed
presently my friends came to me in i distributed presence among my family and gave arms and largess after which i yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment mirth and merrymaking and forgot or but i had suffered
such then are my brothers is the history of what befell me in my sixth voyage and to morrow in shallow
i will tell you the story of my seventh in last voyage which is still more wondrous marvellous than that of the first six
when it was the five hundred and sixty third night
she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sinbad the seaman had relighted the history of what befell him in his sixth the voyage and all the company had dispersed sinbad the landsmen went home and slept as of wont
the seventh voyage of sinbad the salon
no o company but after my return from my sixth voyage which brought me abundant profit i resumed my formal life and all possible joyance and enjoyment and mirth and making mary day and night and i tarried some time in this solace and satisfaction till my soul began once more to long to sail the seas and see foreign countries and company with merchants and here new things
so having made up my mind i packed up in bales acquainted to get precious stuffs suited for sea trade and repaired with them from bagdad city to bassorah tow where i found a ship ready foresee and in her a company of considerable merchants
but the captain arose and tighten in his girdle tucked up his skirts and after take in refuge with alla from satan the stoned climbed to the masthead whence he looked out right and left and gazing at the passengers and crew fowl to buffeting his face and plucking out his beard
this he set in a saucer wetted with the little water and after waiting a short time smelt and tasted it and then he took out of the chest a booklet wherein he read a while and s weeping no o yee passengers that in this book is a marvellous matter d noting that whoso come tit that shall surely die without hope of escape for that this ocean is called the sea of the climb of the king wherein is a sepulchre of our lords solomon son of david on both be peace
a second fish mad its appearance and which we had seen naught more monstrous
when suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship which rose out of the water and settled upon a great reef the haunt of sea monsters where it broke up and fell asunder into planks and all and everything on board were plunged into the sea

that jury could not possibly findin let the prisoner had not deliberately an intention a blown up the albert hall the question was could they find any extenuating circumstances which would permit of an acquittal
of course any sentence which the law might feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an imaged pardon but it was highly desirable from the governments fine a view that the necessity for such an exercise of clemency should not arise
i he long pardon and the eve of a vi election with threads of a heavy voting defection if it were withheld or even the lad would not necessarily be as surrender but it would look like one
hence the anxiety in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round to tape machines in white hall and dawning street and other affected centres

in the drawing room after dinner their nervousness and upwardness increased

she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not be stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later bearing a clean jug in her hands
the pigeon coats had turned paler than ever missus peter had a final inspiration
peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lived so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed within measurable distance
missus peter turned to her guest with confidential kindness
peter is little weakness a chance in the family good lord

then as archy stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he rid the faint rustling once more and again all was silent
he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full vexation injure au proper as the prince caller a love of our own dignity of which archibald grey stroke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british orr officer had a pretty good stock
and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
calm murr came on this idea directly as he recalled the facts that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless sit of people who would stop at nothing
no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would not me about
the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after the little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could
to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest points signal for help ms boat's crew roy surging for him how to escape
the window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find the ms be fitted into the stone sill
next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old fashioned marble mantelpiece fireplace chimney
yes if other rays failed he could escape up the chimney
no that was too bad he can not do that
sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hose were completely gone now and he said as teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people
a narrow table against the wall and two places
he went and tried to force his head through recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the body would pass
but there was no chance for his body there that had would not gr first
a fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
sure you will ground everywhere boy yes father quite
i'm going on the breakfast
shall i come too father no
stop here till sir risdon come down until him very sorry that we should have cleared our last night only a born fool saw jerry nanny's lops boat coming into the cove and came running to say it was a party from the cutter yes father
shall im not to be uneasy t all right and'll e everything clear away tonight
the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin or archy raced stroke way with his heavy eyelids pressed down by sleep
what a queer dreamy thought to himself
but how queer for mister gird to be talking like that to andrey teal the boy who helped the cook
and why did any call mister gr father
there was an interval of thinking over this nighty question during which the low whistling went on
and i'm hungry too tell i was up my suppose
no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint missed hung with reads of smoke
what did they say false alarm tell servants and they would clear all away to night see if anything had been left about locker wrote
once out of that room he could ram and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunt him down
oh those bars he ment they exclaimed and he was advancing towards them when just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of bootes against stone work and rans face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young m ship instead
there was the first to recover from the surprise
well he said ho
go round open the door i was should in last night by mistake
i sew you last night in wondered his boy he was
it was your father kick for shirking and my well i hardly know you
nonsense
won't do said rem burly
think i don't know you mister offer
won't do said red quickly i know you
declining the spire tow you renewing who walked you in
archie stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
he has gone to give the alarm fe the prisoner and he looked ex suddenly round for away escape
nothing but the chiny presented itself
a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curve dirk glanced at the edge ran to the window and began to cut it one of the bars labor in vain
he divided the pain and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realized that the attempt was madness
the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear selling sound as he found it now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the dirk into a sheath
no i can't part with that ha ha ha laughed the board jeeringly
fellow yes i'll give you a ginea if he will live me out
ginea said the boy think i'll do with her guinea well then too
be quick there's a good four i want to get away at once
not you only a sham
why your clothes don't fit you when your caps put on all
never mind about that let me out of this place
i told you a fisher boy cried arch impatiently but trying ought to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
not you look like a wild beast in a cage mick a monkey you in soon
aren't you checked himself and the boy laughed
it was your turn yesterday it's mine today what a game
you laughed and fleered at me when i was on the cutter's deck
i say you do what like the lemon just like a big mogi and show
ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long low fit of laughter
you ropes and me he said
why i could tie you up knot and heave you orlick lig game
bit if a mighty fed on a salt tack and we lily biscuit talk of gi him me ropes and
once more will you come and let me out no
to his astonishment the board did not flinch but thrust his own ars through placing him about the middy's waist clenching his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle

it was immediately following the rock alum robber at eight air iowa that their first appeared a delivered and listen of some local pipers and missouri to connect us with this robbery

the miller and i across the bridge the three were on some dry good boxes at the corner near the bank and as soon as they saw us went right into the bank instead of wedding for us to get there
when we came of ail mer shut the bank door which they had left open in the hurry
je yes helen whose hard worst do near try to go into the bank that miller ordered him away and you ran around the corner shouting
git your gun's boys they're robbing the bank
and i called to him to get inside at the same time finding a pistol shout in the air as a signals of the three boys at the bridge that we had been discovered
almost at this instant i heard a pistol shot in the bank
shadwell woods and jim wrote up and join us shouting to the feele in the street to get inside and faring their pistols to emphasized their commands
if any of our party shot him it must have been woods
meantime the street was getting uncomfortably hot
every time i saw any one with a bead on me i would drop off my horse and try to drive the shooter inside but i could not see in every direction
doctor wheeler who had gone upstairs in the hotel shot miller and he lay dying in the street
changing his pistol to his left hand bob ran out and mounted miller's mayor
what kept you so long eye pits
is to the rest of the affair inside the bank i take the account of the north field narrator

the showers were closed and this cause bunker an instance delight that was almost fatal fitz chasing with a bullet

the whistle on the old mill blue and we feared that it was a signal that had been agreed upon to alarm the town in case we were observed but we were not molest
he had to sleep with it pillar on my breast jim being also cripple with a wound in his shoulder and we could not get much sleep

one of the fellows in the outer lin not brave enough himself to join the volunteers who had come in to be south was not disposed to believe in the surrender and had his gun leveled on bob in spite of the handkerchief which was waving as a flag of troops
sheriff g lisping of water one county who was taking bob's bristol from him was also shouting to the fellow
including those received in and on the way from north field i have eleven wounds
and caff lis ben's order not to sheet was the beginning of the protector that minnesota people established over us
captain murdock
but mars port had flourished enough to kill it off
some of mar's laws dated from the time when lawn force ment had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
the stonewall gang numbered perhaps five hundred
even der alex and failures had to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which eat out some kind of a marginal living
they were safe from protection rackets there none bothered to come so far out
the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
captain murdock was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
the pressure was enough to get them for him
corn reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
i've got afraid hand and we're going to run this the way we would on earth
your job is to protect the citizens here and that means every one not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
the first man making a shake down well get the same treatment we going to use on the stone wall boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
he picked out five of the men including gordon you five will come with me
the rest of you can teem up anyway you want tonight pick any rout the open th came in let's go
bruce gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick and murdock's eyes fell on him earth cot
two years gordon admitted
for a second gordon cursed himself
he began wondering about security then
nobody had tried to get and touch with him
there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim philosopher ball glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
moving in two groups of threes it opposite sides of the street they began their beat
there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lac air
gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands
corn's eyes popped at that
he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
the other four cops had come in reluctantly
he brought him to the ground was a single blow crossed the kidneys
they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cup started off
to find a phone and call the wagon
were not using waggons murdock tow him lin them up
if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were clubbed carefully
murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulders shaking and tears running down his cheeks
the captain's face was as sick as gordons felt
i want the name of every man and the gang y can remember he told the man
colonel they'd kill me i don't know
murdock took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tufts
if he should turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
trouble began brewing shortly after though
murdock sat one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
and the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men had been beaten before
get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
but the captain stirred finally sighing
now the copse are giving me we covered gordon
but the stern wal gang as backing wan
but us going to be tough on them
bruce gordon grimaced i've got a yellow ticket from security
murdock blanked he dropped his eyes slowly
what makes you think wain will be reelected
nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
ever see a martian election
no youre first her he can't lose
and then hellas going to pop in this whole planet maybe blown wide open
it fitted with the dia predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair rust r on around the corner
cost a more but they'd be respectable
because izzie is always honestest according to have he sees its
but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
the groups grew more experienced and murdock was training a new squad every night
it wasn't exactly equal but nothing was here
this could lead to abuses as he'd seen on earth
but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor wain was reelected
there was night outside and the philosophers bobs at the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precedes
it had probably been years since any had dared risk get after the sun went down
and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that hay system was working
gordon hit the signals witch and the mar speaker let out a shrill whistle
gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
you can't do it to me and
i'm reformed i'm going street
you damned cops cent omnia was blubbering
one look was enough the work papers had the tell tail over thickening of the signature they had showed up on other papers obviously forgeries
some turned away as gordon and the other cop went to work but most of them warn't squeamish
when it was over the two picked up their whimpering captive
jenkins the other cop had been holding the wallet
must have been making a big contact in something fifty fifty
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
when gordon and jenkins came back murdock tossed the money to them split it
whatever comes to hanna
like this social call gordon asked him
the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober noe
youre me some bills governor
eleven hundred fifty credits
you didn't pay up your pledge to the captain fund so i had to fill in
a thousand interest at ten per cent a week standard right
gordon had heard of the friendly interest charge on the side here but he shook his head wrong izzie
hah is he turned it over and shook his head
now show me where i signed any agreement saying i'd pay ye back
first second izzie's face went blank then he chuckled
he poured out the bills and handed them over
thanks his e thanks yourself
the kid pocketed the money cheerfully nodding
the little guy new mars as few others did apparently from all sides
and if any of the other cups had private rackets of their own izzie was undoubtedly the man to find it out and used the information with a beat such as that even going halves and with all the graft to the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped into the bench
go on except dam it
there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
the little publisher was back at the crusader again
only gordon and sheila were left
credit had been established again and the businesses were open
gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwelling spilt like the dome but opaque the privacy
they have been lucky
sil bird's volunteers were official now
fats place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
he reached automatically for the class of ether needle beer
thought ye'd be in the chips
that's mars gord knacker other's comment why don't you pull off the planet fats you could go back to earth i'd guess father nodded
guess a man gets used to anything hell maybe i can hi some bumps to sit around and whoop it up when the ships come in and bell this is a real old martian den of sin
there was a grin on the other space
finally got out orders for you it's mercury
we sent fy others a same way and they failed
let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
you can't stay here
there's a rocket waiting to tranship you to the man on the way to mercury right now gordon sighed
and i paid her the pay we yew you from the time he began using your beds she's out shopping
but his old eyes were glinting
did you think we'd let you go without seeing you off cover he asked
aye ay oh dad it i'm getting old
he grabbed gourds hand and waddled down the landing plank izzie shook his head
any colchester had begun to make pins with leslie
leslie determined to tripe upon us an english language and literature
her tastes alway in the duration her idea being by and by to follow her mother's proficient of jervis for which he alway showed considerable attitude

her face grew suddenly watch death what is it there

she looked round the room
now i remember she got a letter which upset her very much and went out
leslie went to the window and flung it open she put her head out and tried to pear into the darkness but the moon had already said and she could not see more than a cup of yards in front of her
she is a very queer the rated creature and at letter there bad news in their letter
why can't you doing out by yourself
leslie lift the room but she had scarcely gone a dozen places down the corridor before she met any returning
andy eyes were very bright her cheeks were no longer pale and there was a brilliant color and him
she did not take the least notice of lessening but going into the room shut the door

she gott into bit as she spoke and rap the cloaks cutty round her
c you manage with a candle just for once
certainly saide slyly
she turned off the light a letter candle which she put behind her screen dim prepared to get and beard
andy's manner was very mysterious
annie did not mean to confine in anyone that night and the kindest thing was to leap there alone
tie it out busily yourself propped asleep
annie is that you she called out
there was no reply but the sound of crying steps came quicker and quicker now then th interrupted by a groan
oh this will kill me my heart will break this will kill me
the gold of saint elizabeth
immediately after t that evening leslie ran up to her room to make preparations for it to ease all
