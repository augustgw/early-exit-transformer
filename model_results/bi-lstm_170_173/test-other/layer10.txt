there's iron they say in all our blood and a gran or two perhaps is good but he he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
margaret said mister hale as he returned from shown his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thornton made his confession of having been a shopboy
you don't mean that you thought me so silly
i really like that account of himself better than anything else he said
his statement of having been a shopboy was a thing i like best of all
you who were always accusing people of being shop at helstone
i don't think mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some part of what he said
his father dying in miserable circumstances
why it might have been in the world house
his father speculated wildly failed and then kill himself because he could not better disgrace
all his formal friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
no one came forwards to help the mother and this boy
at least no friend came forwards immediately and mister thornton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
so they lived milton
how tainted asked her father
op papa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade in making money
and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his eye nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
not vicious he never said that
improvident and self indulgent were his words
margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
however out it came
papa i do think mister thornton a very remarkable man but purse me i don't like him at all
i do said her father laughing
personally as ye call it and all
i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
but good night child
there was several other science of something wrong about missus hale
she had dixon held mysterious consultations in the bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was accustomed when any distress of her mistress called up on her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chambers soon after dixon lifted and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
but though she received presses and f words back again in such profusion as would have gladden her formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
she lay wet very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
a servant give dixon permanent resistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attentions she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
visiting register officers seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she met bessy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
well busy how are you
better or not better if you know what that means
not exactly replied margaret smiling
i'm better in not being torn to pieces by coughing the nights but i'm weary and tired or milton and longing to get away to the landor boola and when i think i'm farther and farther off o heart sinks none no better i'm worse
margaret turned round to walk on side of the girl in her feeble progress homeward
but for a minute or two she did not speak
at last she said in a low voice
missy you wish to die
bessy was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
not worse than many others are reckon
but what was it
you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton
i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly
i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful line as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
as they turned up into a small court opening out into a squalled street betty said
youll not be daunted you fathers at home and speak said bit gruff wish at first
but nicholas was not at home when they entered
pass bessie at last
busy took a long and feverish draught and then fell back and shut her eyes
margaret bent her grew and said bessy don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or may have been
remember who gave it to you and made what it is
now i'll not have my wench preach to
but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of laffed was to be
i believe were see and no more
that's what i believe young woman
i don't believe all i hear no not by big deal
but whose come at last and who is welcome as long as who will keep them preaching on what who knows not about
it's simple are not far to fetch nor hard to work
but the girl and he played the mole was margaret
talking hardly on him he's a good man hes
i sometimes think i shall be murk with sorrow even in the city of god if other is not there
her feverish collar came into a cheeks and the feverish flame into eye
but you'll be their father ye shall o no heart
she put her an to it and became ghastly pale
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest up her bosom
presently the spasm that fore shuddered death had passed away and busy roused the soft and said
i'll go to bed it's best place but catching that margaret's gown you'll come again i know you will but just say it
oh come tomorrow said margaret
margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
she was late for tea at home
have you met with a servant dear
m'm mamore that anne abruptly would never have done
s'pose i try said mister hale
everybody also had their turn at this great difficulty now let me try
i may be the singular to put on the slipper after all
what would you do papa how would you set about him
why i would apply to some good house mother to recommend me one known to herself or her service
very good but we must first catch our house mother
the mother of him spur to us said margaret
mister thornton the only mother he has i believe said mister hale quietly
i shall like to see her she must be an uncommon person her mother added
perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
she sounded to be such careful economical person that i should like anyone out of the same family
my dear said mister hale alarmed don't go off on that idea
i am sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
take notice that this is not my kind of fortin papa if i have any at all which are own agree to or you always accusing me of it
i don't know positively that it is her as either but from little things i have gathered from him i fancy so
they cared too little to ask in what manner her son had spoken about her

they did not stay there but walked out across the dawns with the scarlets were singing and on a dip of the dance came upon great stone wards and towers for a strong and grey
what's b there said dickie
replied he of a truth i heard him not and i watch him not and folks are all sleeping
but she said whomsoever thou seest awake hes the reciter
then said the eunuch art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him
rejoined the eunuch who then was the reciter point him out to me
by allah replied the firemen i tell thee the truth
tell me what happened whats machan
what ails thee then that thou must needs recite verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are leave for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
and he also provided the two following d stitch
when musa al zaman heard the thirst improvisation she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and there will o home then she wept and cried to the eunuch and said to him w to thee
he who recited the first time hath recited the second time and i heard him hard by
by allah and thou fetch him not to me i will assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee and yee shall beat thee and cast yee out
but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and to him no hurt
returned quickly and linger not
when it was the seventy third nine
but the yok said i will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returning to my lady without him
now when the fireman heard these words he feared for thar machan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch by allah it was not i and they know him not
so go thou to thy station and if thou gave meet anyone after this hour reciting aught of poultry whether he be near or far it will be i or someone i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me
then he kissed the oo's head and spake him fair till he went away but the castrato fetched around and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
i say what made my ignoring what have the beater cup i drain far be from me thy land to flee nor will i bow to those who blame and for such lave would deal me shame
then said the eunuch to thar machan pe me with thee o my lord
o my lord continued the eunuch and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
we will do thee no upright o my son nor wrong thee in aught but our object is that thou b d gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and returning real and safety and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news
then the eunuch went out to soul machan and said to him reside what verse is thou knowest for my ladys here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition
and also these
then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and away fell down in a fainting fit
when the eunuch saw the case he wandered that them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
after a while they came to themselves ands al zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression laughed her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the cun and what had happened to her with the badawi how the merchant had both her of him and had taken her to her brother shakin and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of bye how he had made their marriage contract with her and had gone ino her and how the king their sire had sent and asked for her from sharpen
but now go to thy master and break him quickly to me
the chamberlain called castrato and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the talker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girding his ass and preparing for flight
she said it hath reached me auspicious king that when the talker girted his ass replied and bespake himself saying oh would i knew what is become of him
i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence these pages about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime
why didst thou say i never repeated these couplets nord i know who repeated them when it was thy companion
but now i will not leave thee between this place and but that and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee
was as i feared the canals discerning but on allah we are all returning
then the eunuch cried upon the pages saying take him off the ass
and he answered i am the chamberlain of the emir of damascus king sharpen sung over marina woman lor bagdad and of the land of chorasan and i bring tribute and presents from him to his father in bad dad
so fairy forwards no harm shall befall you till you join his grand wazir than done
then he bade him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was trembling to the emir of damascus and was bound to king mar with presents and the tribute of syria
so it was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the king's son sharpen and may came sultan over his father's rail
and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet z a machan for quoth they his name be light of the place and he hath a sister nuzhat al zaman hies the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for alias and none wotteth what is become of them
so he turned to the wazir dandan and said to him readily your tale is a wonder of wonders
no o chief wazir that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions for let his almighty will restore it to you z machan and his sister knows zaman whereby we will settle the matter as with easily can
when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with grey joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the tway and what befell them and the cause of their long absence
zaman bowed his head awhile and then said i accept the position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and sat him on the right way
then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharpen
after a while the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of bagdad and chorasan a conquering host like the pool tide sea and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
when it was a seventy eighth night
any meat all rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place
lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zum machan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and sires san spear
moreover the sultan commanded his wazir d done call at ten days halt of the army that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain
he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and order the host to halt ten days
what had happened to me
he asked himself something warm and living quicken at me it must be ino neighbourhood

mister kit deserved that saw soon remarked that arm of ments had been so prompt as to take the res was about
a print fit still that seceded
the price did not alter the cours but near dots fast
i heard the ridding the boarding pines too as they were cut adrift from the spanker boom and fell upon the decks
kite went out and then turned with three or four muskets and as many pipes
the still nets that ranged boatside was like that of depth
the joi behaved beautifully he came round like a time
the question was now whether we could pass them were not for they got nearing up to grapple
and captain behave perfectly aways it critical instant commanded adad silence in the closets int tens into his orders
not soul board the john sar
on our side we gave the gentleman the four sixes to have the nears into the stern most pro which was steal near a tables neath the cent
they were night the yells of fiends in englanders
i doubt if we tache a man in the neats poor'
that sate the ship parts ahead all her cams befo marines in her wake
they swarmed up and front a servers palings as thick as they could jam together and you couldn't hear youse think for the noise
some sung out pear down the fence tear down the fence
the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
sherman run his eyes slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out gaze e but they couldn't they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
the average man's a coward
because they're afraid the man's friends will sheep them in the back in the dark and it's just what they would do
so they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with a hundred mast cowards at his back and lunches the rascal
you didn't want to come
but a mob without any man at the head of it is good neath pitifulness
now lead and take your half a man with you thomson he has gone up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harness he healed it after them looking tolerable cheap
you can't b keep careful
they argued ty to keep em out but he wouldn't listen an a whole show come to stands do
and one or two women begin to spring
so then the ring master he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse
it warn't funny to me though i was all a tremble to see his danger
and a horse of going like a house of fire too
he shed him so thick the kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits
why it was one of his own men
and but never mind arrested his outfit it was just white but it was awful funny
the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and haw hot till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do it another time
twenty people sings out
the duke says yes
everybody sings out sold
but a big fine lookin man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on
just a word gentlemen they stopped to listen
what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk to show up and sell the rest of the town
you bead it is the judge is right everybody sings out
we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding downstream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
we never showed light till we was about ten mile below the village
green horns flatheads
no i say is it don't
well it don't because it's to breathe i reckon they're all alive
well that's what i'm a sayin all kings as mostly resky ins as fur as i can make out yous dat's so

take them all around they're a mighty ornery life it's the way they raised
well they all do jim
now to do hes a tolerable like of man in some ways
this one's a middlin hard lot for a duke
when i waked up just to daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees mooring and morning to himself
it don't seem natural but i reckon it so
he was offen moaning in morning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying oh little elizabeth
don't you hear me shut dado
i lay i make you mine
just as loud as i could yell
which was sound enough judgment but you'd take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to haile
the king's duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy
why before he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when he'd take off his new white beaver an make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he'd walk right out of the ark and maybe was old of vitiges himself
jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my pile ready
were you bound or young man
get aboard says the king
i done so and then we all three started on again
the young chat was mighty thankful city was tough work toting his baggage such weather
he asked the king where he was goin and the king told him he'd come down a river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there the young fellow says
but then i says again no i reckon it ain't him or else he wouldn't be paddling up the rib you ain't he or you
no my name's bliant alexander oblige reverend alexander bliant i suppose i must say as im one of the lars poor servants
you see he was pretty old and george's good earls was too young to be much company for except mary jane the ran heading and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didn't seem to care much to live
do bad too bad he couldn't have lived to see his bots poor soul
i've goin in a ship next wednesday f rio genera where my uncle l

mary jane's nineteen susan's fifteen and joanna is about fourteen that's the one it gives herself to good works and has a hair lip poor things

old peter had friends an they ain't going to let them come to no harm
flame defeated acquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkes and about peter's business which was a tanner and about george's which was a carpenter and about harvest which was a dissenting minister and so on and so on then he says
when are deep they won't stop for a hail
was peter wilts well off
when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got all
now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags
so then they waited for a steamboat
but the king was car he says
they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would they tell you
they one of them says kind of soften gentle
phelps was one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look alike
i went around and climb over the back style by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen
i out with a yes'm fore i thought
so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
when we got there she set me down in a split bottom chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
well it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt
and i think he died afterwards he was a baptist
yes it was mortification that was it
your uncle's bent up to the town every day to fetch you
you must met him on the road didn't you agis man with a
why child it'll be stole
it was kinder thin ice but i says
i had my mind on the children all a time i wanted to get them out to one side and pumped them a little to find out who i was
pretty soon she made the cold chill streak all down my bite because she says
i see it warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
so i says to myself here's another place where i got to rest the truth
i open my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes
children don't you say a word
i see i was in a fix now
missus phelps she jumps for him and says
has he come no says her husband
i can't imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy
uneasy she says i'm ready to go distracted
he must have come and you've missed him along road
oh don't distress me any more i'm already distressed
why silas look yon up the road ain't that somebody comin
the old gentleman stared and says
i hain't no ida who is it
is tom sawyer
being time sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river
then i says to myself s'pose time solder comes down on that boat
but i am huge you pleased that you have seen my lady
i knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
her conversation has more charms than can be mere beauty and a humor and disposition would make a deformed person appear lovely
why did you not send me that news and a glen
why the best honour is i have a squireen that is as good as a night
in ems we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish and occasion as i cannot tell which is strangers
all the people that i had ever in my life refused were brought again upon the stage like richard the thirds ghosts to reproach me with and all the kindness discoveries could make i had for you was late to my charge
my best quantities if i have any that are good served but for aggravations of my fault and i was allowed to have wit an understanding a discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in this
tis a strange change and i'm very sorry for it but i'll swear or not how to help it
is the fish is a squire of things and has so many mistresses th anybody may pretend to share in him and re believed though i have the honour to be his near neighbour to speak freely i cannot brag much that he makes any court to me and i know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often
i think my youngest brother comes down with him
i can no sooner give you some little hints whereabout they live but you know them presently and i meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if i inclining to look graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
i have missed four fits and have had five and have recovered so much strength as may be venture to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
but besides i can give you others
i am here much more art of people's way than in town for my aunts in such h pretend and interesting me in a power over me do so persecute me let their good nature will take it so ill that they are not accepted as i would live in a hollow tree to avoid them
you'll think him altered and if it be possible more melancholy than he was
if marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him i shall pray that all my friends may escape it
well in earnest if i were prince that ladies should be my mistress but i can give no rule to anyone else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing your hearts to her may be infinitely taken with one i should not value at all for so s a justinian wise providence has ordained it that by their different humans everybody might find something to please themselves withal without envying their neighbors
the matter is not grey for i confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best please never to be known in it one any occasion whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly avoided one must satisfy oneself by doing nothing that one needed care knows
if i had a picture that will fit for you he should have it
how can you talk of de faring fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you could
i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am sudden he knows yet most of the injuries you have received from her
we have had another to beat but much more calmly
then besides there was a time when we ourselves were indifferent to one another did i do so then or have i learned it since
i have been studying how on cheek might come by his intelligence and i very believe he has it from my cousin peters
how kindly do i take the civilities of your fathers in earnest yee cannot imagine how his let appease me
would it would leave me and then i could be i shall not always have occasion for it
by poor lady vavasor is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against the protector and did not discover it
she has told now all that was told her but vows you will never say from whence she heed we shall see whether her resolutions areas unalterable as those of my ly tish
i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
i never saw anyone yet that did not look simply and out of countenance whatever you were wedding well designed but one and that was of two persons were at time enough i confess to contrive it and nobody to pleas invest
the truth is i could not endure to be missus bride in a public reading be made the happiest personal earth
do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather th fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
yet in earnest your father will not find my brother payton wanting and civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters to me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set higher value upon her sister than she deserves
my aunt told me no longer gone them yesterday that i was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome take heed
you see i give you fell warning
by the next i shall be gone into kemp m where other journeys laid aside which i am not displeased at because it would have broken o intercourse very much
here are some thos as l comedies me all you like them
i told you in my last that my suffolk journey was laid aside and that into kent hasten
if i drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will i bequeath all my kindness to you in it the charge never to bestow it all upon another mistress lest my ghost rise again and haunt you
indeed i like him extremely and he is commended to me by people that know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than they i did not intended so though i can assure you
i do not find it i am told i was so extremely when i believed you love me
but i am called upon
directed for your master
i see you can cid when you please then was authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded from a very good principle in me
we dare not that our tongues lie more on one side of our mass and the other for fear of overturning it
you are satisfied i hope at this that i escape drowning
but i am troubled much you should make so ill the journey to sore little purpose indeed i writ by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my matters
how one grim you will be but alas
for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to not decay in even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission
they laugh to hear me say that one unkind word destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase every day if it were possible but never lessen
you go broad all d and play all night and say our prayers when weet time
while and silver earnest now i would not live thus a twelvemonths to gain all that king has lost unless it were to give it him again
will you be so good nature
he has one son it is the finest boy that ere you saw and has a noble spirit but yet stands in that all his father that one word from him is as much as twenty things
you must give me leave to entertain you souse with discourses or the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
not to knowing you would come home i can assure you nor for any other kitchen on my own but with a cousin of my that had long designed to make herself sport with him and did not miss of her aim
in my life i never heard so ridiculous and discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
ever since this adventure i have had some great a believe in all things for this nature that i could not forbear laying a pease cart with nine peas into under my door yesterday it was informed by it that my husband's name should be thomas how you like that
she put her hair down turned his good bac put her feet on the fender and took party into her lap all of which arrangements signified that something very important had got to be thought over and sudden
the more proposal the more credit
after ride it and lighted and maybe desist the consequence of that night's fun
just suppose it is true that he does ask mee and trice i yes
what a spiteful thing i am
i to do so much for all at home how i should entry that
let me see how can i begin
he has known how all her life and has a good influence over her
now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that week for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided she missed the blessed little interviews that used to put a certain flavour of romans into her dark hot working days
i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that knowst attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected
it was that indescribable something which women are wick to see and feeling men who have been pressed with wise and good mothers
this had an especial charm to polly for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to everyone
lately this changed especially towards parley and it flowed her more than she would confess even to herself
at first she tried to think she could but unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even gratitude
polly felt a very cordial friendship for mister sydney but not one particle of the lure which the only kind in which laugh capitally paid
this finished polly's indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with the spies of the old eve in her composition
when saide came polly started as usual for visit to back he and best but couldn resist stopping at the shores to leave a little passe of a fen that was calling time
a foolish little speech to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tenderhearted girl trying do her duty
take hold of massa charlie's hand miss maybe and b pretty like willie and flossy said the maid
at a street corner at black eyed school poy was parting from a rosy face schoolgirl whose music rile he was reluctantly surrendering
how he got there was never very clear to pony but there he was flushed and a little out of pet but looking so glad to see her till she had not the heart to be stiff and cool as she had fully in turned to be when they met
cheerily could not help it it was so blessed to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
that is the way i get the worse answered polly
she did not mean to tell but his fright this was so agreeable she forgot herself
but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she choices to mend her thoughts though she won't own it and to surprise you some day by the amount of heart and sense and goodness she has got
thank you no
her lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
asked the artful young man laying a trip into which polly immediately fell
he was quickly to take a hint than she had expected and being bot bled ingenuous with off to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as farce own
so and you made a last buoyant remark he said quietly watching your face keenly all the while i thought so bah i'm going out of town and business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me annoyed
she thought she had a good deal of the coquet in her and i've no doubt that with time and draining she would have become a very dangerous from person but now she was far to transpontine even to tell a white like lovely
he was going before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first imps the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and excepted little servants
parley did not return to her favourite walk till she learned for many that uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the ways pleasant after all
lugging too and for as usual what's the news with you
perhaps she told him
utterly done with and laid upon the shelf
minnie s the other day she reached he was a pigeon so she could paddle in the bottles and not fs above rappers
now don't be affected polly but just tell like a dear has not he proposed
don't you think he means to
truly julie fare
i don't mean to be prying but i rely thought he did
well i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have
i just gave him the hint and he took it
he meant to go away before that soom think his heart is broken or mind what city tatler say
he understood and being a gentleman made no fuss
but polly it would have been a grand thing for you
i'm a you know i'm prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days
never mind what the business was it surfaces to say that it was a good beginning for young men like tow who having been born and bred in the most conservative pass of the most conceded city in new england needed just the healthy hearty social influences of the rest to widen his views and make a man of him
fortunately everyone was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for romans of any sort when the four young people worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not bothered up in their respective hearts
pity that the end should come so soon but the hour did its work and rend its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind but the young fogs did not see it them for their ice within because of the partings that must be
if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a summer town but sydney often called to his vacation came and the voluminous close bonds with polly beguiled the long days
time wite once e emotion but the letters were sure in that very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear
now i'm only tired had a good dear to do lately and the doll weather makes me juster trouble brew
forgive me polly but i can't help saying it for there' there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can
i twit not deceive myself but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me
thank heaven for that
cried polly with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice
poor parley was so taken by surprise that she had not a world to say
none were needed had told her face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish post wich and the huns are after it
once or twice but sort of chokingly and i thought it was only some little flirtation
it was good of me not a guess before
it was her tender earnest and defiant that fanny forgot the defence of her own lover and ignorant of poly loyalty to hers for this faithful all ab sobbing love was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friends boast of two or three lover a year and calculate their respective values but almost as much coolness as the young men discussed fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to marry
i hope maria baileys only think sir she added softly for i could not bear to happen disappointed again
said fanny turning hope for all at once
suppose i say a word to tome just inquire after his heart in a journal away you know im give him a chance to tell me if there's anything that ter
bear it people always too pare things somehow answered polly looking as if sentence have been passed upon her
it was a very different window from the last above the girls
if any wanted to show him what she could do towards making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded by than she suspected for in spite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mister sidney at least for he was more the house friend than ever and seemed determined approve the change of fortune made not difference to him
she kept much at home when the day's work was done finding it pleasant to see dreaming of a book or soon alone than to exert herself even to go to the shores
polly was not at all like herself that window and those news to her so invaded at it most
for ned was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole baily question and left them in other darkness
fy came broking in pony one day looking as if she poured tidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them
but if work baskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any lead
she had even been in society before the revolution
it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext
every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monseigneur saint francois gave it to monseigneur sa julian monseigneur saint julian gave it to monseigneur saint e sidus monseigneur saint juss gave it to monseigneur sa procopius et cetera et cetera
and the schoolgirls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under the veils charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers from
it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
the rule of ponto val did not forbid this
she would not show the subject anyone
thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were on occupied or bored in the convent
some mune chaplet some authentic relic
they lost themselves in conjectures
when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making and effort fly but the dancers laughing with a satanic air
moral love conquered by the colic
the press returned and seated herself once more hon cure
we will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability
father foment
reverend mother do you know the chapel
and you have been in the choir in pursuance in your duties two or three times
there is a stone to be raised heavy
the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar

fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing

she continued further for him

saint turrets bishop of port where the mouth of the tyber empties into the sea requested that on his toob lightly engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides in the hope that passers by would spit on his tomb this was done

general observations on preserves confectionery ices and dessert dishes
the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for excepted sugar is used in considerable qualities the successes very uncertain
fit gathered in weet of foggy weather will soon be mildred and beat no service for preserves
but to distinguish these papa replies by great attention and considerable experience
if you dip the finger into the serf and a plight to the thumb the tenacity of the serve will on separating the finger and thumb afford a thread which shortly breaks this is the little thread
let it boil up again then take it off and move carefully the scum that is risen
it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil
before sugar was amused honey was employed the pres of many vegetable productions though this substance was now human wed the juice of the sugar cane
fourteen dy nine
bore them up three days successively stemming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use
the reason eef this emptied out of the preserving pan into earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
from this example the process of preserving fruits by ser would be easily comprehended
they should be dried in the stove or of them on a sea and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they returned
in this way it is also that orange and woman ships are preserved
marmalades james and fruit pe of the same nature and now agen meral quest
marlton jams differ little from each other their preserves of half liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits i am sometimes part of the wines with sugar
but they may keep it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen o three
in all de operations for preserved making when the preserving pains used should not be placed on the fire but on a tribute unless the jim was meane on a hot plate when this is not necessary
confectionery fifteen o eight
in speaking of confectionery should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head for the various fruits flowers herbs loose juices which one board with sugar were formerly implied in pharmacy as well as for sweetmeats were called confections from the latin word confuses to make up but the term confectionery embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary quae
a thousand and more ornamental dishes that had done the tables of the wealthy should re purchase from the confectioner they cannot profitably be made in home
however as late as the wing of our two last george's fabulous sums will often expended upon fanciful deserts
the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems
isis
at desserts or at some eating parties ices are scarce suitably dispensed with
the s battle is generally made of copper kept bright and clean
they should be taken immediately after their repast or some hours after because the taking these substances dulling the process of digestion is apt to the look indisposition
there was one till aimee the widower who had a sodden and the daughter by his first wife
from the vay gave it the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the men's children and not a corner to be found what they could get any rest so the boy thought that the best thing he could do was to pull out into the world and try ton his own bread
but his sister who was still at home fared wards and worse
tis me go said the
when the king interred and saw he stood still as if he were in fetters and could not stir from the spot for the picture seemed to him so beautiful
these promised to make all the haste he could and set forth from the king's palace
at last they came inside of land
well if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her task it into the sea
what is my brother saying asked his sister again
on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchen maid who slept there to lent her a brush
she begged very prettily and got it and then she bushed her hair and the gold dropped from it
out long me a greek bushy bride sleeping so soft by the young king's side on send and stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with the cold snake unpitied and unwept
i shall come twice more and then never again said she
this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she s the bell gout three times and when day dawned she departed but if she was going she said as she had said before i shall come once more and then never again
no one can tell how the light of the king was to get rid of that hideous bushy bride and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as day itself
wilt th serve me and watch my seven fools as the king
the youth thought that it was very easy word to wash the holes and he could do well enough
hast thou watched faithfully and well the whole day long said the king when the light came into his presence in the evening
yes that i have said these
i had gone at once to seek a place he said but never would he do such a thing again
the necking promised him the same punishment and the same reward if hell polished his brother
when he had run after the fools where a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by clef in a rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with the distaff and she called to him
come hither come hither my handsome son and let me comb your hair
the youth liked the thought of this let the holes where where they chose and seated himself in the cleft of the rock by the side of the old hag
so there he sat with his head on her lap taking his ease the live long day
on the third day said the lad wanted the set
the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go but all to no purpose when cinder lad set out on his way
i am walking about and so to a place said singer lad
i would much rather have the princess said cinder lad
and thus they journeyed onwards a long long way
when they had gone thus for long long way the full again or us dost thou see anything now
yes now i see something that his wife sits him to lad
it loos lies a chalk of a great thick birch tree
sigil tri but could not do it so he had to take adopt from the pitcher and there one more and after that still another and mean was able to be over sword with perfect ease
for we have brother said the princess whom now art to have when thou kids tell the king what we eat and drink but theres a mighty tole who h hast to spell over us
when they had telled a long long way the full said dost that seem any thing
and now inquired the pole ceased nothing now
now then said the full dost thou not see it thee now
that is a liver said the full and we have to cross it
i have done my best replied sin lad
once upon the time there was a king in the north hope one many wars but now he was old
the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
so he asked the queen how do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning and she said
then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
he is no bigger than other dragon said the tutor and if you were very with your father you would not fear him
then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dwarf who wounded all the treasure and took it from him
only one ring was left which the dwarf wore and even that was taken from him
so wigan made a sword and cigaret tried it with the blow in a lump of iron and the sword broke
then cigaret went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's blade and gave them to regan
so cigarets said that sword would do
then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley
but sigurd waited till half of him had called over the pit and then he thrust the sword graham right unto his very heart
sigg said i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
but all men die and no brave man let's death frighten him from his desire
guy thou fafner and then fafner died
then cigaret grow back and met racin and riggin asked him be rose baffin's heart and let him taste of it
says they gould put the heart of fafner on a stake and roasted it
theres cigaret roasting fafner heart for another when he should taste of it himself and learn all wisdom
that let him do then ride over hen fell to the place where brunhild sleeps
there must she sleep till thou comes for her waking rise up and rid for now sure she will swear the vow fearless of breaking
then he took the helmet off the head of the sleep red behold she was a most beautiful lady
then sigurd rode away and he came to the house of the king who had a fair daughter
limn held father told gunner that she would marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower and that they rode and got to sit his horse at the flame but he would not face it
for one day when born hilding gudrid were bathing borne held waited farther sou into the river and said she did that to show she was thundered superior
for her husband she said had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it
not long to wait he said till the bitter sword stands fast in my heart and thou will not live long when i am dead

i swear answered sancho
i say so continued don quixote because i hate taking away anyone's get name
i say replied sancho that i swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship stay and gone gretta may be a little let it out tomorrow
though your worship was not so badly off having your arsy incomparable beauty you spoke of but i what i have except the heaviest wax that i think i had in all my life
unlucky me in the monna and bore me
didn't i say so worse luck to my lin said sancho
it cannot be the more answered don quixote but those under enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone
if they do not let themselves be seen they let themselves be thought said sancho if not let my shoulders speak to the point
might speak too said don quixote but that is not a suspicious reason for believing that will we see us he enchanted more
the officer turned room and said well how goes a good man
sancho got up with pain enough in his bones and went out to the in cup in the dark in meeting the officer who was looking to see what have become of his enemy he said to him senor whoever you are d us to favor and kindness to give us little rosemary oil salt and white for it is wanted to cure one of our best nights errant on earth who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted more that is in this inn

the cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so lou that they reached the ears of his master who appalling to listen at tentatively was persuaded that some new adventure was coming until he clearly perceived that it was the squire who uttered them
he saw him rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that had his rage al him it is my believe he would have laughed
saunter took it and as he was raising into his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming sancho my son drink not water drinkin out my son for it will kill thee see here i had the blessed balsam and he held up papas gon liquor and with drinking two drops what thou wilt certainly be restored
the strides of a lain man like the odium glances of one eyed man they do not reach their goal very promptly
cosette had waked up
jean valjean had paced her near the fire
you will wait for me at a lady's house i shall come to fetch ye
everything is ranged and nothing is said fauchelevent
i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
that's where the difficulty les
it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out
and she will hold her tongue i answer for that
fauchelevent grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean
you understand father madeline the government une it
jean valjean stared him straight me i and thought that he was waving
for she liver went on
it is to morrow that i am to bring you in the priors expensive
then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community
that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the fault under the altar of the chapel
that the press and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased
that he fauchelevent was to nail up the coffin in the cell raised the stone in the chapel and lower the corpse into the vault
and then that there was mummer the empty coffin
what is that anti coffin
asked jean valjean fauchelevent replied
what coffin what administration
for s levin who was seated sprang up as though alma had burst under his chair you
you knowed forceful what you have said mother crucifixion is dead
and i add and father madeline is buried are
you are not by other men saw the madeline
this offers the means give me some information in the first pace
how long is the coffin six feet
it is a chamber on the ground florid has a grated window oping on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one leeds into the convent the other into the church what church
that the church in the street of the church which anyone can enter
have you the kings to those toodles
no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the draw which communicates with the church
only to allow the undertakers men to enter when they come to get the coffin
who nails up the coffin i dy
who spreads the poor oor it
not another man except the police doctor can enter the bedroom that is even written on the wall
cid you hide me in that ring to night when everyone is asleep
about three cook in the afternoon
i shall be hungry i will bring you something
you can come a nail the up in the coffin at two o'clock
fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger joints but that is impossible
ah impossible to take a hammer and drives nails in a plank
jean valjean had been in worse straight th ms
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bail of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to it conmee his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean's gloomy talons
you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nay on the top plan pon loosely good and what if you should happen to car for to seize
a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze
who is there who is not said to a cat do come in
the over prudent cats as they are and because they are cant sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
but jal valjean's coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself he grumbled
if you are sure of coming out of the coffin al right i am sure of getting you out of the grave
an o the old school the gray digger puts the corpses in grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
i shall follow that is my business
that's halts the undertakers men not a rope around you'll often fan lower you dam
the priests as the prayers nates the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
one of two things will happen he will either be sober or he will not be sober
that is settled father fauchelevent all will go well
on the fallen day as the sun was declining the very rare passes by on the boulevard men hulled off their hats to an old fashioned hearse ornamented with skulls class bones and tears
this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a hinge corpse with drooping arms
a morning coach in which could be seen a priest in his surplice and a choir boy in his red cap followed
behind it came an old man in the garments of a labourers who lumbered along
the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at might in winter in this cemetery they was subjected to a special discipline
these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalid
dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it
bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the rogier har it hinted at poverty pleas shams if you pease
to be buried in parcels is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognized as elegant
the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the induction of jean valjean into the bedroom all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch let us r boning passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly vial offence in our sight
it is one of the faults which resent on a duty
the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences
in the cloister what is called the government is only an intermeddling with authority an interference which is always questionable
make as many laws as you please men but keep them for yourselves
a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
fuca limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind
jean valjean's composure was one of those powerful tranquillity which are contagious
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
he played with further mysian
he did what he knight with him he made him dance according to his whim
the permission for interment must be exhibited
he was a sort of laboring map who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a matter under his arm
the man replied the grey digger
the grave dinner yes
you i
father mis janus the brave digger he was
flush one had expected anything but this but a grave digger could die
it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do dy themselves
he had hardly the strength to stammer
he persisted feebly father mesta is the grave digger
do you know who little fatherland laws he is a jug of red wine
but youre a johnny fellow to
are you not comrade we'll go have a drink together presently
the man replied
he looked more out of anxiety than from infinity
the grave digger walked on in front of him
fauchelevent passed the unexpected cab once more in review
fuca who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
theer father nest ands dead
the man replied completely
the good god consulted his notebook which shows when the time is up it was far the most young's turn far musty u died
stammered fauchelevent it is made
you are a peasant i am the parisian
threshing one fort i am lost
there were only a few churns of the wheel distant from the small ary leading to the nun's corner
and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well
fortunately the soil which was light and wept with the winter reins clog the wheels and retarded its speed
my father was a porter at the cranium tell home
but he have reverses he had losses unchanged i was obliged to renounce the profession of author but i am still a public writer
so you are not a grave digger then
returned fauchelevent clutching at his branch feeble as it was
here a remark becomes necessary
a fauchelevent was of his anguish offered a drunk but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
the grave digger went on with a superior smile
one must eat
the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake
yes but if i should already ask for something what
well do it for me for i swear to you thy don't love you as the others have loved you
there are bolts in the door wretch
i don't know how it is but it's ceased to me as if i do
now go i can't keep my eyes open
it seemed to me as if this sleeping city belonged to me i searched my memory for the names of those whose happiness i had once envied and i could not recall one without finding myself the happier
education doubly feeling the sense of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sentinels so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first castle of love all the more ardent because they seem so pure
the more girl believes in goodness the more el will she give way if not tor lover at least to love for be without mistrust she is without force and tow her love as a triumph that can be gained by any young man of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must they find at tempting how surely must be listened to the first voice which comes to tell its secrets through their bars and bless the hand which is the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil
with them the body has worn out the soul the senses half burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
they loved by profession and not by instinct
when a creature who has all her passed to reproach herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere irresistible love of which she had never felt herself capable when she has confessed her love how absolutely the man whom she loves dominates her
they know not to what proof to give
in order to disturb the laborers in the field was one day devoured by a wolf because those whom he had so often deceived no longer the leaf in his cries for help
this is the same with these unhappy woman would he love seriously
but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough and soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one drought all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
but to return to the first day of maison
when i reached home i was in a state of mad gaiety
the woman becomes a man's mistress and loves him
how why
my whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night
here are my orders tonight at the vaudeville
cond during the third and tract
the boxes filled one after another
only one remained empty the stage box
at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and marguerite appeared
did she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she looks the happier i should eat
what is the matter with you tonight said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
you should go to bed she replied with that ironic error which went so well with a delicate and witty face
where at home
you still love me can you ask
because you don't like seeing him
n less i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and marly gain into the carriage which was witting for them at the door
i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
you in the way marguerite but how
well you might have had a woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive
during this remark marguerite looked at me attentively
my dear prudence i answered you do not know what you are saying
yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as my door you were w to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
because i am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm
is that really the only reason
if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
honestly do you care for me a little a great feel
i fancied for a moment though i might give myself that happiness for six months you will not have it you insisted unknowing the means
well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
i listened and i gazed at marguerite with admiration
when i thought that this marvellous creature whose feet i had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts by part in her life and that i was not yet content with what she gave me i asked if ms desire had indeed limits when so spied as probably as mine had been it reached after something further
truly she continued we poor creatures of chance have fantastic desire and inconceivable loves
we are not allowed to have hearts under plenty of being hooded down and of ruining our credit
we no longer belong to ourselves
we stand first in their self sustained last in esteem
never do give you advice which is not lucrative
it means little enough to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they get dresses or a bracelet out of them and that they can drive and our paris from time to time or come to our box at future
such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old an olds neither protects mor consols
i thought i could sett the life which he offered me or what would you have
what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
mara wite hired out with this long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough full up her the chief to her lips and from that to her eyes
marguerite do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but the name of heaven tear up the letter which i wrote to you and do not make me leave you to morrow it would kill me
marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
here it is i have bought the back
i to letter into fragment and kiss with tears the hand i gave it to me
look here prudence do you know what he wants said marguerite
he wants you to forgive him
one has too but he wants more than that what then
i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled
all mister puzzle grinned
this sounded like another story
he was curious about that black headed cousin of all mister buzzard very curious indeed
anyway he would find out
please mister belcher please tell us the story he begged
now all mister buzzard is naturally good natured and accommodating and when peter bagged so hard he just couldn't find it in his heart to refuse
wig back in the days when grandpa buzzard had his low falling out with old king eagle and done fly so high he scorched the feathers often his head he had a cousin did granpop buzzard and this cousin was just naturally lazy and no couch
like most no count people he used to make a regular nuisance of hisself poking his nose into everybody's business and never tending to his own
wasn't anything going on that's this trifling member of the buzzard family didn't find out about a meadow in he could ask more questions than peel rabbit can and anybody that can do that has got to ask a lot
everybody looked at peter and laughed
so ween set on the chimney toms whenever old jack fs guess to straying down where he had no business
one day this no count's trifling cousin of granpop buzzard get cold in his feet
it was on the little old house and old tumble down house
why he just stretch his forehead as far down the chinee he can and listen and listen
but he don't mind that
oh you all please speak a little louder he hollowed d the chimney just like that
yes saw she sure he was prom scared
they liked to choke that no confessor to death
when he get home he tri try ba suit off but it done get into the skin and stay there
a little sigh of satisfaction went round the circle of listeners
it was just as good as one of grandfather frogs
draw wee fill mix give it me without water
so my friend so wit me off this glass neatly bring me hither some claret a full weeping glass till it run over

while there was rather surly after the ladies had floated away from the scene and he drank his liquor doggedly
it was his fancy i suppose to revive certain sentimental relations which had it may be once existed between him and miss lake and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnified an object in proportion as its pursuit is thwarted
the story of fed dolin and wretches pretty outlines
sit down beside me and i'll tell you the story
he assisted at it but took no part and in factor was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gabled in laughter like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance

but the king laughed him to scorn thou a sword he quoth
in sooth thou shalt have one but it shall be one befitting thin maiden size and courage y so small a weapon can be found in all my kingdom
forthwith the grinning jester began sure eking with laughter so that the bells upon his motley cap were all said a jangling
i did but laugh to think the sword of ehlert had been so quickly fouled responded the jester and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailor's girdle
one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes
thou shalt have thy liberty he cried even though thou shouldst run me in pieces the moment thou art free
it had it suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful vary with filmy wings which shone like rainbows in the moonlight
at this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten
scissors grow a giant's night and save us from yokes might
he could see the ogre standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the chasm and gnashing his teeth each one of which was as big as a mill still
the sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him
thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this dismal s bought while i have the power to help thee
he lifted the scissors and with one stroke d strode the web and gave the flies read him
a faint glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole
the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors
as he uttered the words the scissors looped out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shutters as easily as through it cheese
in a very short time the prince had crawled p the opening
while he stood looking around him in bewilderment a firefly alighted down his arm flashing its little landed in the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me to guy do to a place of safety
what has to become of me cried the poor peasant

to stand between two religions from one of which you would not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to that like souls
marius was clear eyed and he required the true light
the half lights of doubt came him
whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
his discomfort was augment by all the reflections which occurred to him
in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
they soon elbowed him abruptly
request sfera to come and talk with me said marius
what is to become of you said cur fac
what are you going to do i do not know
silver gold here it is
you will then have only a pair of trousers a waistcoat a hat and a coat and my boots
that will be enough
no it is not good what we do after that
do you not german no

the close dealer was sent for
he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments they went to the watchmakers
he bought the watch for forty five francs
hello i've forgotten that said marius
the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot
i have ten francs left said marius
that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sou very slowly
one morning on his return from the law school marys found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistol that is to say six hundred francs and gold in a sealed box
marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt with the respectable letter in which he stated that he had suspicious means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his knees
at that moment he had the mew francs left
he perceived that it was no good talking to the old man and that the principal person in the house was the mother
before her he decides his scatter his pearls
the princess was distracted and did not know what to do she felt she had sent against kitty
well doctor decide our faith said the princess tell me everything
he's there hope she meant to say but her lips quivered and she could not outer the question well doctor
as he weighs the princess went out with the sigh
the family doctor respectfully ceased m middle of his observations
and there are indications metric nervous excitability and so long
the question says thus in present of indications of tubercular process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
yes s an understood thing responded the celebrated physician again lancing in his watch
beg pardon is the yolk bridge dana or shall have the drave
he asked ah it is
o well then i can do it in twenty mines
and how about a tour abroad asked the count doctor
what is wanted is the means of improving attrition enough lowering
the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
but in favor foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling e premises
and then the mother wishes it he add
ah we'll not hast to be sure let and go only those dunning quacks are mischievous
oh times up already and he went to the door
the serrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling if what was due from him they pated his doing so that he ought to see the patent once more
oh no only a few dids princess come his way
and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing room to kitty
when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tears
she answered in and all at once got up furious
excuse me doctor about there is really no logic in this
this is the third time you've ask me the same thing
the celebrated doctor did not take offence
nervous irritability he said the princess when he had left the room however i had finished
and the doctor began sides the vic they explaining the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certainly harness
at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged ino deep meditation as though resolving a weighty bot
finally his decision was pronounced they were to go abroad but to put no fate in foreign quacks and to applied him in any need
it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had young
the mother was much more cheerful wh she went back to her daughter and kitty regent to be more cheerful
educated equal of the upper places are trying to stifle ever growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social
this is absolutely indirect
in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interest for the enters of the group
the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
the m who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires
the basis of authority is bodily whiles
the possibility of applying bodily violence the people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison and submission to one will
these bands of armed men said missa to a single will are would constitute the army
the army has always been and still hear the basis of power
power is always in the hands of those who control army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything can cour popularity in the archy knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
indeed it could not be otherwise
only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
but since this is not the case and on the contry men and power always far from being sins through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
even if there was w a time when owing to the low standards of morals on the disposition amen to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage because the violence of the government was less than the violent of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strife between the individual seems still less and a life of the state seems even more secure
it was produced on one hand by the natural growth the population and on the other by struggle and conquest
after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
but this justification is never more than temporary
internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression deserted by the authority over the dinan individuals
governor authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
and therefore the oppression of the oppress always goes on growing up the furthest women beyond which it cannot gold not killing the goose with the gold nice
the most convincing example this is be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient tim subdued by conquest
so it has always been
foot nuts this fact that in america the uses authority exist in spite of a small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position de positively confirms it
yet per clusters know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be in sufficient and no longer belong on incitants men they feel their this curying their position depends on the increase drink of the army
the reason to which he gave expressions essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the pops engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of to day so carefully distribute the repugnant from the frontier are stationed in central districts and the regiments from the centre are stationed on the frontiers
the meeting of privy speech put into plain language is that funds are needed notist foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the enslave toiling masses
and this abnormal order of thanks is maintained by the army
but there is not only one omen there other governments exporting their such as by violent in the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its enslave subjects
and so every government needs an army also to product its booty from its neighbor brigands
this increases contagious as montesquieu pointed out hundred fifty years ago
every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defence against its subjects becomes a sort of danger for neighbouring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
the despotism of the government always increases with the strength of the army and as external successes and the aggressiveness of the government increases with its internal despotism
the rivalry of the european states and constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers who obtained at the least possible express
and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practised upon them all citizens have become their own impress
this inconsistency has become obvious and universal author service
in fact the whole significant of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitory of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life the groups of persons
but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had met to avoid
but inst of doing that they expose to individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting strike with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors
the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorbed the grave re part and the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
the danger of war ever ready to break winners all reforms of my social like vain and fruitless
with the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
government assert that armies are new above all for external defence with that is not true
there are needed principally against their subjects and every man undergo verse military service that comes an accomplice and all that acts of violence are the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
and for the sake of what are making them
i'm expected for the sake of a state to makee sacrifices to renan be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
except with the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number that that can only be done by change of en warmer and moral influence
so that the justification of stained violence on the ground of the protection gives us from evil dispose persons even if it had some foundation three of four centuries ago has none whatever now
except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means a communication s
without the state men would not have been able to form a social institutions needed for doing anything
this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in formic societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
without governments nations were be en slided by their neighbors
the government they tell us with its army is necessary defend us from neighboring states who might enslave us
and if defence against barbarous nations is meant one thousand part of the troops now under ams would be amply sufficient without purpose
the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes us on the contrary the much greater danger of such attacks
even looking at at practically weighing that is to say all the birds laid on him by the states no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with a state demands and serve the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantages than to refuse to do so
to resist would need independent thought an effort of which every man is not capable
so much for the advantages of disadvantages both lines of conducts for a man of the wealthy class and oppressor
for a man of the poor working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages
say you now supper
chris looked from medical plated flash like to a cara jack can spark plug
no e's a job ban that's chickie harris
o kay he said
only why didn't you ask from yourself
mike became uneasy and fished and mastic band out of his pocket made a flick of paper and sent it soaring out in em street

that really meets it in pursue
he would have liked to get the job for jakie needed it that somehow the task facing mister wicker especially now did the light was going and dusk edged into the streets with not what chris intended for ending the afternoon
mike's expression changed in what once to one of triumphs but brisk was only parsley encouraged
mither and' going after all this turned to him
might was standing on the corner
o shocks
chris it off once more passing a bleak little victory in church perch on the hillo mister wicker's house
an empty lot cut in into by church lane gave look of isolations of ale shaped brick building sir mister wicker's both house in place at business
the longer wing toward the back got back door that opened on a water street the space between the house and the scots and amby had been made into a meat up along flour garden fenced off for the sidewalk by box shrugs in a white picket fence
a livid yellow stained of arising deal in the factories inlay clouds lowered and tumbled above
the air was growing chill and christ sided to finish the job
all at once he wondered how his mother was and everything and amon pinched and tightened itself
at the foot of the hill he reached the house
there were three things that always caught his eye event the litter of dusty pieces
on the left the coil of rope in the centre the model of a sailing ship in the grain glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of the negro boy in backing trousers turkish jacket and white turban
but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe at home in bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabelle to
he had never seen anyone go into mister wicker's shop now he thought a bed
how then did he limp and what did ever sell
a sudden car horn walking from his dream
and many times he examined mister refers window and poured over the rope the ship and the nubian boy he had never gone into mister hooker's shop
some now alone till someone should answer the bell they looked eagerly if uneasily around him to
what with one window the lower in tee outside the long narrow shot was sombre
head the hand un beams crossed it from one side to the other
mister okar's back being toward the source of light chris could not see his face
the double fans a minute wrinkles breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheap bones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead
lineal toss some white buzz above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarians hair but what drew and held chris's gaze were the old men's eyes
crisp blinked him look again yes they were still there
chris swallowed it his vice came back to
y sir he said
i set your sign and i know boy who eats the job
he's a schoolmate to min
jakie harris's name is new reeling is the charm
i i just wonder if the pic was to lop and
what he saw was a fresh cheap lad tall for thirteen sturdy linsey and good humor in his face and something sensed an appealing about his eyes
guess there must be lively fire of that room beyond
without fear jakie gig skinning the job sir
but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mind why do he not see the reflection of the headlights of the cars moving a boom around the corner of wall under street up the hill toward the
the room seemed overly still
then in that second return and faced about
the wide bow window was there before him three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that pored in from a crust of water
christo water where was the free way
it was no longer there nor were a high walls and smoke stacks of factories to be seen to
but warehouses were still there
flabbergasted and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer appear out the window and every direction
no electric signs no lapt streets
when the people's drove store and stood but half an hour before rose the ruse of what was evidently an inn
a courtyard is firstly knight by flaring torture too showing the swinging side hung on the post
the posts planted at the edge of it was now broad and money road
the coach would had stopped piled high with lugged stamp to a halt beside the flight court card
they moved into the end the coach rattled off to the stable
by window has a pow for those few who are to see
the learning of magic was pin means easy
he told his master at once he got simon goesler his hoard of money his hiding places for it
chris therefore threw himself and of all the primaries of his task
one afternoon when he had returned after arst to mister wicker's study he saw that there was something new in the room a ball with a gold fishing it stood on the table but mister wick was not to be seen
what should all i do first
how you improved my boy he exclaimed it is that time for you to try missus is gutter change any
suppose i changed and catching back
mister wicker went impatiently beside him for a few moments for chris to get up his courage
then is nothing happen with a voice like a whip mister wicker said started once
a sensation spread faster and faster
his head swab and he felt faint no little sick but he persisted through the final words
he thought n without a feeling or pride and commences experiencing with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight some little time lapt before mister wicker's voice boom bows by
seventy four book one return
the figure shoes carved in sub eastern style a curved up pointing toes
that all at once the idea came to chris
if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
he squatted on his haunches examined the carved wood figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion
but how did one change inanimate to an of it
chris got up and stole back to mister wicker's door
he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his broom above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was reeling empty with sir june's proper shape and opened the doors of the cupboard the far end of the room
the afternoon raining before increased in storm
thus came two hours before its time thunder snarled in the sky
certain elements were to be mixed and poured the proper time
mister worker began moving about upstairs the full boards creaked pray and still chris could not leave until the potion fumed and glowed
with infinite caution chris closed the door silently behind him in running light be forward breached the figure the negro boy
it was as it the stiffness melted
under his eyes wing folds of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its rounding upon the coat and oh the face
the wind grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of car flowers moved a the bouquet fall
they went down to their corners first
guess mister finney went to his quarters i don't member seeing him cross the deck come over that way at all
next net silly was ring into the helm by over jones it took over ned went on down
it looks to me as if it could b in one of several people and i'll be switch if i know who won't give my eyes open
the mabel was nearing tweedy
we've fought her in fresh stores to tick old mare
chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down in his cabin
certainly my boy boomed out the captain as blue eyes abruptly keen and penetrating
mister filly would be some time on deck we cannot be own heard in here
his face rose with nervousness that this might do o do was in answer and he stood stiff and stone before captain blizzards
the captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say i do
this ship in more to me than wife or mother all family
you paused fingering this lower lip looking sideways in an afflicted fashion at chris standing before him
we shall say no more but i trust you understand the responsibility you have
the ship its cargo in its men will be in your hands
yes sir i think i can do it safely or should not try sir
captain lizard's round pink faced creased in its winning smile
you then went on to describe what else was to follow for covering in the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
the caf losh was not a word the captain or anyone else of his time he had understood
what can be said during that time sir christ thought ask
i am somewhat skilled in medicaments i have to be as a captain of ship and crew know it
i shall say that you are in my own cabins as that i can care for you
not since he had left mister wicker and chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
he knew now that his absence for as long as he had to be away would be covered up and satisfactorily accounted for to
their conversation had taken some little while
one churchyards yon
i knew well enough that he might be carried thousand miles and box scar locked in perhaps without water or full

there were a few preparations to be made the logs to be gone over winters constructive as to renewed vigilance and then after distinguishing the whole light we crept in darkness through front door and into the night
i ask no questions

bright and matty with a chinee curtains and the little tole had set out not in elegantly and her bed by ping wolf finch asleep on his perch with a bit of sugar between the wires of his gage her billow so white and unpressed with its little edging of lace
when he came back to the drawing room a toted brought hill of all the gloom in his hand with her lace handkerchief he bathed her temple and forehead
there was nothing very brotherly in his look as they peered into a pale sharp features during the process
there don't mind me she said sharply and getting on she looked down at her dress and pinches and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle he had just set down and went swiftly to her room
and she threw backer real and going hardly to the dort mechanically survey hersel him at lass

the act said that in is of difference of opinion there must be about
he went up to the table and striking it with his fingering he shouted loudly about
he was shouting for the very course search ivanovitch had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and drowned opposition to it the same indica ness though in a more seemly fall on the other side
shouts were raised and for a mom all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order a ballad
we shed up blood for our country
the confidence of the monarch with no shaking the accounts of the martian he's not of cashier but that's another point
votes please peasley
they expressed the most implacable hatred
levin did not in the least understand what was a matter and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whet there or not the decision about flerov should be put to the vote
he forgot as sir g ivanovitch explained to him afterwards this elegies that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that together to the martian it was necessary to have a majority of wards that to get a majority of boards it was necessary to secure faro right tow that to secure the recognition of ferox write boot they was desired on the interpretation to be put on the act
but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he ad a respect in such an unpleasant a vicious state of excitement
to escape from this panful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the freshman bar
he particularly liked the way one bay whiskered water who showed us gone for the other younger was and was dured at by them was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly
levin advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much em bad dressed he turned to so gi ivanovitch with a question whereon marica put it
sol ivanovitch ground
that is a matter for each man's own decision he said severely
having put it in he recollected that he ought have thrust his left hand too and so he trusted though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background
a hundred and twenty six for admission ninety eight against

then there was a laugh a button and two knots were found in the box
but the old party did not consider themselves conquered
in duly smith cobs spoke of the trust and nobleman of the province had placed to him the epinay merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service
this expressions in the martials face was particularly touching to leavin because only the day for he had been at his house about his trusty business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kind hearted fatherly man
if there are men younger and more deserving than i let themselves
and the marshal disappeared through aide door
there were to proceed immediately to the election
two noble gentlemen who had a weakness was strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of smet pot and a third had been robbed of his uniform
und learning this the new party had made haste during the dispute thur of to send some of their men in his ledge to clothed the strict gentlemen and to bring along one of the intoxicated the meeting
lenin did not care to eat and he was not smoking he did not want to join his own friends that a searcher ivanovitch stepan arkadyevitch sizii and the rest because vronsky in an inquiries uniform was charming with them in eagle conversation
he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening tow was being said around him

these portions were unmistakably seating a place where they could talk without thinghe

oh still just the same always are lots the landowner answered with a resigns mind but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be
why the what is there to understand
there is no many in it at all
then two one must keep up connections
it's a marble obligation of a sort
and then to tell tod there's one's own
their purpling of the sort but rear the landowners
that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
and we are laying out a garden climbing one before the house you know and there you have a tree that stood the centuries and the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you don't cut down the old fellow to make him for the flowerbeds but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the pay
well and how is your land doing
but one's work is stolen for nothing
oh well one does it what would you have
and once more the landowner went on leaning his elbows in the window and chatting on my son i must el has no days for it
so there will be no one to keep it out and yet one dood
we walked about the fields and the garden no said he stuffy miss livid everything's well looked after p your gardens neglected
to mind thinking i'd cut down the lantry
here your thousands of lines and each would make two good fellows a park
you married i heard said the landowner
yes it's job a strange he went on
the landor are chuckled under his white mustaches
why don't we cut down our box for two
said levin returning to a thought that had stock him
there's a class instincts to of what one ought and ought nor to do
there's the peasants too a wonder of them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
without a return too at a simple love
when he came from the bath process visited him again
but hermon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honor of the seventieth birthday of the old sculptor ephrata
she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour
so the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition
the bank one was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing daffy and telling her the words of the oracle
he longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
since his return from the oracle the fear of the rescue demeter might yet be the work of merciless had again mastered him
the approval as well as a doubts which had arises in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts
then he went directly to the neighbouring palace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered it impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy
when herman entered the residence of the grammaticus in the palace the guests had already assembled
the place by harmon's side which alia had chosen herself would then be given up to arsenal
true an interesting conversation still had powered to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight and referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyment as blindness debarred him
a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and woman to whom no tad bound him save the presence of the same host
creates had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair haired nio had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing arsenals praises among his professional associates
his son had been the royal dame's first husband and she had deserted him to marry lis macs the aged king of thrace
the king's sister the object of his love cried herman incredulously
we woman are only as old as we look and the lee's enti woman of this beauty of forty practiced arts which giver the appearance of twenty five yet perhaps the king values her intellect more than her pison and the wisdom of a hundred serpents is certainly united in this woman's head
the three most trustworthy ones i here aus the liege chrysippus in the admirable process
let us hope that you will make this three leaved clover the luck promising four leaved one
your uncle too has often with praiseworthy generality helped a to know in many an embarrassment
how long he capt rating from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the whole city with delight
when he did finally summon you he fed things which must have wounded you
that is going too far replied herman
he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arsenal had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in rhodes
the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and alia eagerly confirmed the statement
herman listen to the parent silence
the rodion was just beginning to praise arsenal also as a special friend and connoisseur of the sculptures art when crates hermann's fellow student asked the blind artist and behalf this beautiful companion why his demeter was placed upon a pedestal which to others as well as himself seemed too high for the size of the statue
yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of score at him
a woman who earns for the regard of all men and makes love of toy easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals
only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and anthea did not wish to lose hermann's regard
how indifferently look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you was still a genuine great and artist the case was different
though so louder denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no id allusion and snows me i can prove
it was nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
not a sound if you value your lives
to offer resistance would have been madness for even hermon perceived by the loud clanking of weapons round them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prisoner the place of execution
was he to be led to the executioner's block
what pleasure had liked to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art
ought he not to greet his su an end as a boom from the immortals
did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be imagined
whatever might await him he desired go better fate
if he had passed into annihilation he hermann wished to follow him thither an annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
but if he were destined to meet his virtuous and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not tell them how sure he was a finding a joyful reception there from both
the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was non nemesis no it was a kindly deity
yet it was no allusion that deceived him
again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
sometimes with the touching entreaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoner's away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philippe her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
cried herod and grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and followed the soldier whom the captain detail to guide her into the palace
to morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to the dangerous path
daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philip's silenced tar with the grave exclamation the order of the king
as soon as the captive artist was alone with a woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forth incoherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly returned the pressure he could not restrain the desire to clasp perch was heart
in spite of his deep mental distress he could have shouted aloud in this delighting gratitude
he might now have been permitted to find forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the posture the following morning still sealed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought not to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impolicy exclaimed you know that i love you
i love you and have loved you always
stoutly exclaimed tenderly what more iss needed
but herman with drooping head murmured to more i shall no longer thee what i am now
then after raised her face to his asking so the demean is the working myrtles
put a terrible or deal again awaits you
and i fool blinded also mine could be vexed with you for it
bringing this before your mind and everything else you must accept with it if you consent with a time arrives to become mine conceal impaled nothing
so oki is intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day
he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
his heart contracted painfully in his solicitude about his uncle's fate increased when philippic informed him that the conspirators had been arrested at the banquet and headed by ames the rodion chrysippus and brocas had perished by the executioner's sword at sunrise
besides he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one last word
on the way his hard throbbed almost bursting
even after these image and what threatened her father and her with him was seated far into the background
he was appearing before his companions only to give truth it's just due
the egyptian o bay and his master crossed the wide space strewn with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the feast or performances even had his eyes retained the power of sight his blood was coursing so widely through his veins that he might perhaps have been enabled to distinguish the statues around him and the thousands of spectators who crowded closing together richly garlanded their chiefs glowing with enthusiasm surrounded the arena hermon
shouted his friend silas and joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk hermon
even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeanour he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithful to his art and his nature
honour to myrtle as and his art but he trusted the s noble feast still assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception and a his prayer for recovery

the two monsters took off their shoes and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses
by means of this stratagem they followed so closely that although within a few steps of sarah and tom they did not hear them
sarah and her brother having again passed by the tippy frog arrived close to the dilapidated house which was partly in bins and its open cellars formed a kind of gulf along which the street ran in that direction
in an instant the schoolmaster with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized satan with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling you into this hole
no said the old bat grumblingly no not wing as shame
tom satan did not lose his presence of mind during this scene rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred

france who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to have it's request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a shorts delay the count joined them in the salon
my very good friend and excellent neighbour replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions
my father the comte de morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of franc and madrid and i u hesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal
i can scarcely credited

so be it then replied the counts and extending his hand toward a calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said to days the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o'clock now promise me to remember this and expect me that twenty first of me at the same hour in the forenoon
i residing my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the farther sid of the courtyard and tire separated from the main building
now then said the coup returning his tablets to his pocket may yourself perfectly easy the hand of your timepiece will not be more accurately marking the time than myself
that depends when do you leave
for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two
then we shall not meet in paris
i fear i shall now have her honour
well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young man allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey
what is the matter asked albert of france when they had returned to their own apartments you see more than commonly thoughtful
i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
did you ever need him previously to coming hither
upon my honour than missy
he dwelt with considerable false and energy on the almost magical hospitality had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainments in the bottle of the thousand and one night he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof our trace of all these events save the small gort seen in the distant arising driving under full sale to with portal recur
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandied peppino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled
but said france the cui and bandits that were among the crew of his vessel
why really the thing seems to me simple enough
talking of countries replied france of what countries the counts what is his native tombe whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life life as marvellous as alone that hatred his succeeding years with so dark and blooming and his
certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered
my dear france replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert the morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him
what are his means of existence what is his both plays of what countries native
i confessor asked me none no he merely came and freed me from hands of senor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outwards appearance of ease and and concern i did not very particularly care to remain
and this time it must be confessed to that contract of the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's side
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of reputation
and now my dear france let us talk of something else
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination i bear the morcerf would follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge store and which merits a particular description
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and caught these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate
at a quarter to ten a valid entered he composed with a little room named john and who warmly spoke english all albert's gables ment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count's chu also
wait then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sip with her as she wished

the valley left the room
good morning mis young good morning said albert your punctuality really alarms me
you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past
no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans
yes he has not much to complain of boches the capital of charles the seven
it is for that reason you seem so early
i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour
pests i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them acceptable
besides that does not concern the home but the financial department
about what about the papers
and the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders
they say that it is quite fair and that sewing so much red you ought to reap a little blue
come come that is not bad said lucia
with your talons you would make your fortune in three or four years
the gentleman had not needed to sit down to become interested apparently he had taken up the volume from a table as soon as he came in and standing there a for a single glance round the apartment had lost himself in his pages
that has an unflattering sound for me said the young man
she is winning to risk that
just as any a the visitor inquired presenting himself with mother a where cad aspect
he was tall and lean and dressed throughout in black his shirt collar was low and wide and the triangle of linen a little trampled exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat was adorned by you pin complaining a small red stone
in spite of this decoration the young man looked poor as fore as a young mated look who had such a fine head and such magnificent eyes
those of basal manson went dark deep and glowing his hand had a character of elevation which fairly added to his bethel it was ahead to this scene above the lel with the crowd and some judicial bench or political platform or even on a bronze medal

and yet the reader who lets a complete image who desires to read with the senses as well as with the reason is entreated not to forget that he prolonged his consonance and swallowed his vowels that it was guilt to the legiance and interpolations which were equally unexpected and that his discourse was pervaded by something sultry and vast something l was that rican in its rich basking tone something that suggested the tuning expanse of the cotton field

missus lean's familiarity expended even to her sister she remarked to miss chancellor that she looked as if she were got her for a sea voyage
poor ramsden announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery but in reality he had never been so bois as at that moment
the woman he had hitherto known had been mainly his own soft climb and it was not often exhibited the tendency he elected and cursory deplored in missus line's sister
lon was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very provincial
he was sorry for her but he saw in a flange that no one could help her that was what made her tragic
she could not defend herself against a rich admiration a kind of tennis of envy of anyone who had been so happy as to have that opportunity
his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruelty of dictates
the state of mississippi singed to him the state of despair so he surrendered the remnants of his parsimony to his mother and sisters end at nearly thirty years age benighted for the first time in new york in the costume of his province with fifty dollies in his pocket and nary hunger in his heart
it was in the female line as they a manson had written in answering her letter with a good deal form and flourished he spoke as if they had been royal houses

she had erected it into a sort of lull of conduct that whenever she sis she was to take it and she had frequent humiliations at finding herself safe after all
she was perfectly safe after writing to base the larsen anne indeed it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thank her he was only exceptionally superior for her letter and assure her that he would come and see her the first timely business he was beginning to get a it all should take him to boston
he was too simple too mississippian for that she was almost disappointed
of all things in the world contention was most sweet to her the why it is hard imagine who it always cost her tears headaches a deal to bad acuter and it was th impossible baser ransom would not care to compend
miss chance had in myself folk so much a the vital subject would not she make a fe remarks and get them some of her experiences

she knew her place in the boston highway key and it was not what missus balan supposed so that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been no representative of the aristocracy

and having put himself in a fair way as it hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darcy case colonel ashley went down to police headquarters to learn more facts in the connection with the murder of the east indian
pickers and down of in heaven bay carroll yee up
colonel was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke girl lazily upward on his cigars then to say more

but he had many more to do with it colonel th that cat
perhaps not admitted colonel ashley
we've got our man and that's all we want
you are on the darcy case they tell me in a way yes
i'm working in the interest of the young man
it's just one of them coined is like
busted his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair
gad explained the colonel
the very pair i was going to buy
look here colonel do you know anything about this
and the detective professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
i happened to see those candlesticks in the window of single fronts shop the other day and i made up my mind to buy them when i had a chance
now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen
fut i don't know whether that's his first or his last name anyhow he had a parr named sherley
anyhow he in fronted get a long very well it seems
neighbours often heard him scraping lan and his afternoon they went at it again to hawk and heavy
toward dark a man went into bu a lamp
he found the place without lighted stumbled over something on the floor and there was all these body with the head busted in in this heavy candlestick near it
sure held so tight we could hur to get it out
maybee the fight was about who on the watch for the dagoes talked in their foreign angle and none of the neighbors could tell what they were saying i see
and the watch have you it yes or tar
that's the watch announced the headquarters detective reaching in for it going yet see
you're not of scream wishes all that are you just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's
and donald's voice was plainly sceptical
yes it may have some rough edges on it
and i've read enough about germs to know the danger i'd advise you to be careful
if you don't mind i should like to examine this a bit
before the big wind in ireland suggested thong with a knotted desirous compatriot slightly to have the colonel
that's rout agreed the colonel as it continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
in a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a lead pencil
and donn take her friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it
has the surprised detective yes
don't scratch yourself on it whatever you do why not
simply because this watch
someone out her to see you
all i be here in a second
singa front was the panting answer
i want to talk over darcy's case with you the colonel had said and the two had talked had thought had talked again and now were silent for a time'
what are the chose is of getting him off legally if we go righted from a negative standpoint asked the colonel
rather i pathetic question colonel but i should say it might be of fifty fifty proposition
at best he would get off with the scotch verdict up not proven but he doesn't want that nor do i
and you i don't wanted either
but i want to know just where we stand now i know
but i need to do a little more smoking out first now i want to think
if you'll excuse me i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may cat something
in fact i have a feeling that i'll land my fish
i'd recommend him to you instead of blackstone thanks lapped kenneth
what is it perhaps i can help you
the old adage of two head you know
yes it's still holes good
no low money replied the coronel puzzled yes just that
and there's no reason you should know
chuckled the colonel as he skillfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook
and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip now limp fish into the crew colonel gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
the reason she asked no alimony inquired kenneth
no i wasn't thinking of that
however don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough for they
well i don't know that you can
it isn't generally know w on the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him
it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating graduate into that of a baser sort
you don't mean the large struck that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did
the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him
aaron grafton statement was being unexpected great confirmed
he remembered that cynthia and grafton had once been in law with each other
she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer
because larch made no defence
large by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
so i had to let her have her wife and medusa asked the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel fee
no but he will or i'll soe him and get judgment oh he'll pay all right
and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up
still i would like to know
the murderer of missus darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweler was tried
it had a double reputation shall to speak
grave and even reverend the conventions assembled in its ball room in politicians of the upper if not better class were frequently seen in its dining room or cafe
large himself was a peculiar character
in a smaller place he would have been called a saloon keeper
and it was this man rich over said handsome certainly that sent thea retford had married
to this was the answer whispered money
and in a way was true
she also sawed opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges
after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the larch hotel it could hard be called home became the scene of many festivals
then it was said of large that shon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat his wife with refined cruelty that hidden away from the public underneath his habitual matter there was the wrongness of the brute
but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less off on represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smirched or who had not yet acquired any and were rolling to take a chance
it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me in the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as of the judges members of the bar to be seen there kenneth explain to the colonel
meanwhile colonel ashley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he saw darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something to be done always returned the answer
don't gurry you will come out all right
i'm going to rectify them but it will take time
it's hard for miss mason too although she's bearing up like a major
so king god bale who put it up
it was high larch
they took harry away while ago
but he is a pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same
only that i darcy hesitated and grew red
good evening girl he called gilly will you join me in a weals rabbit
thank you no
i'm afraid my digestion isn't quite up to that as i've had to cut out my fishing of late
now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder
the stopped clocks for instance have you any theory
there were three of them the centre figure being got of harry king and he was very much intoxicated
that is not always but sometimes it happened to be so now
i beg your pardon he said in the contry tones he knew so well how to use yet of which he made so low use of late
i said where have you been remarked the other we've missed you
i said i was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort
by polonius someone ask
because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks to much but who is not so wise as he thinks
there was a rattle of coin on the mahogany bar as king sot to disentangle a single bill from the wadded up currency at his pocket
it's it's an odd coin an old roman one that missus darcy had in private collection kept in the jewelry store safe was the whispered answer
i went over them near the day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed
that was hers when on the der
now harry king has it exclaimed colonel ashley
even the sun came out bale and watery at noon
the cool and rheumatism of the rene months vanished

then i took up a great stone from among the trees and coming up to him smote him therewith on the head with all my might and crushed in his skull as he lay dead drunk
behold a ship was making for the island through the dashing sea and flashing waves
hearing this i was so troubled remembering what i had before suffered from the ape kind
upon this he brought me a cotton bag and given it to me said take this bag and fill it with pebbles from the beach and go forth with a company of the townsfolk to whom i will give a charge respecting thee
do as they do and belike thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land
then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pebbles
to these he committed me commend in me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how together that he may get his daily bread and you will earn your reward and recompense in heaven
now sleeping under these trees were many apes which when they saw us rose and fled from us and swarmed up among the branches whereupon my companions began to pell them with what they had in their bags and the apes fell to plucking of the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk
we weighed anchor and shahrazad perceived the dawn of the day and ceased saying o permitted say
when it was the five hundred fifty ninth night
and ceased not sailing till we arrived safely at bassorah
there i abode a little and then went on to bagdad by entered my quarter and found my house and forgathered with my family and saluted my friends it gave me joy of my safe return and i laid up all my goods and valuables in my storehouses
after which i returned to my old merry way of life and forgot all i had suffered in the great prophet and gain i had made
next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawn prayer and after blessing mohammed the cream of all creatures betook himself to the house of sinbad the seaman and wished him a good day
here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales therein
happily amongst you is one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up and all that everything on board of her were plunged into the sea
but it burneth in their bellies so they cast it up again and it can ealth on the surface of the water whereby its color and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it ashore and the travellers and merchants who know it collected and sell it
each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clots and linen cast ashore by the tides and after little the rest of my fellows perished one by one till i had buried the last of the party and boat alone on the island with butter little provision left i who was wont to have so much
but there is majesty and there is no might save in alla the glorious the great
when it was the five hundred sixty first n
then signed for myself i set to work collecting a number of pieces of chinese corner and aloes wood and i bound them to gather with ropes from the wreckage then i chose out from the broken up ships straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the yellows wood making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel of the stream and i tied it tightly and firmly as though it were nailed
land after land shalt thou see can find but no other life on thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul and th thoughts a night all bo shall lend or sooner or late
i rode my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried a raft with it down the underground channel
and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft by reason of the narrowness of the channel whilst the stream ceased not to carry me along knowing not night from day for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me about in my terror and concerned for myself lest i should perish
when i awoke at last i found myself in the light of heaven and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft moored to an island in the midst of a number of indians and abyss
but i was delighted at my escape from the river
when they saw i understood the knight and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace be with thee o my brother
o my brother answered he we a husbandman until us of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding thee asleep on this raft laid hold of it and made it fast by us against thou shouldst awake at thy leisure
i answered for o lad's sake and my lord ere i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after ask me what thou wilt
when it was the five hundred sixty second night
she said it hath reached me our auspicious king that sinbad the seamen continued when our landed and found myself amongst the indians and abyssinian and had taken some rest they consulted among themselves and said to one another there is no help for it but we carry him with us and present him to our king that he may acquaint him with his adventures
so i consorted with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respect
so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing to set out with the merchants for that i pined after my people and mine own land
quoth he thou art thine own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us honor head nice be it for thou gladdest us with thy company
by allah are my lord answered i thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with thy favors and well doings but i weary for a sight of my friends and family and native country
then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchants afore said
he asked me whence they came and i said to him by allah a commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way thither
for state processions a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant eleven cubits high and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks on his right hand and on his left
his letter hath shown me this and as for the mightiness of his dominion thou hast told us what thou hasty witnessed
presently my friends came to me in i distributed presence among my family and gave arms and largesse after which i yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment mirth and merrymaking and forgot or but i had suffered
such then are my brothers is the history of what befell me in my sixth voyage and tomorrow in callin
i will tell you the story of my seventh in last voyage which is still more wondrous and marvellous than that of the first six
when it was the five hundred sixty third night
she said had hath reached me o auspicious king that when sinbad the seamen had relighted the history of what befell him in his sixth voyage and all the company had dispersed sinbad the landsman went home and slept as of want
the seventh voyage of sinbad the simon
no o company but after my return from my sixth voyage which brought me abundant prophet i resumed my formal life and all possible joyance and enjoyment and mirth and making merry day and night and i tarried some time in this solace and satisfaction till my soul began once more to long to sail the seas and see foreign countries and company with merchants and hear new things
so having made up my mind i packed up in bales acquainted to give precious stuffs suited for sea trade and repaired with them from bagdad city to bassorah tow where i found a ship ready for sea and in her a company of considerable merchants
but the captain arose and tighten in his girdle tucked up his skirts and after take in refuge with allah from satan the stoned climbed to the masthead whence he looked out right and left and gazing at the passengers and crew foul to buffeting his face and plucking out his beard
this he set in a saucer wetted with the little water and after waiting a short time smelt and tasted it and then he took out of the chester booklet wherein he read a while and said weeping no o yee passengers that in this book is a marvellous matter denoting that whoso come tit that shall surely die without hope of escape for that this ocean is called the sea of the climb of the king wherein is a sepulchre of our lords solomon son of david on both be peace
a second fish made its appearance and which we had seen naught more monstrous
when suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship which rose out of the water settled upon a great reef the haunt of sea monsters where it broke up and fell asunder into planks and all and everything on board were plunged into the sea
unfortunately there could be no doubt or misconception as the platter baths guilt
he had not only pleaded guilty but had expressed his intention of repeating his escapade in other directions as soon as circumstances permitted throughout a trial he was visit seine small model of the free trade hall in manchester
vir jury could not possibly find that the prisoner had not deliberately an intention blown up the albert hall the question was could they find any extenuating circumstances which would permit of an acquittal
of course any sentence which the law might feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an imaged pardon but it was highly desirable from the governments pine a view that the necessity for such an exercise of clemency should not arise
a headlong pardon and the eve of a vi election with threats of a heavy voting defection if it were withheld or even delay would not necessarily be as surrender but it would look like one
hence the anxiety in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in white hall and dawning street and other affected centres
the jury return from considering their verdict there was a flutter an excited murmur a death like hush
the foreman delivered his message
the jury fine the prisoner guilty of blowing up the albert haw
the jury wished to add a wider drawing attention to the fact that a vi election expending in the parliamentary division of nemesis on hand
and made a lard have mercy on the pole a junior conseil exclaimed irreverently
fifteen hundred said a prime minister with a shudder it's too horrible to thank of
our majority last time was only a thousand in seven
seven thirty amended the prime minister we must avoid any appearance of precipitancy
not later then seven thirty said the chief organizer i have promised the agent done there that he shall be able to display posters announcing platter bath is out the word of pulps
he said it was our only chance of getting a telegram red drabs in tonight
despite the earliness of the hour a small crowd had gathered in the street outside and the horrible menacing tree lunar brain of the fifteen hundred vaulting men came in a steady monotonous chain
he exclaimed won't go
he says he never has left prison without the breast bent to play him out and he's not going to go without one now
said a prime minister we can hardly be supposed to supply this prisoner with a breast stand how on earth could be defended u estimates
and away you won't go unless he has a band
all openin five minutes
his platter buff out yet
in heaven's name why
the chief are unison ran off
this is not a moment for standing on dignity he observed bluntly mercians must be supplied at once
can't you get a strike permit as the organizer
i'll try said the home secretary and rent to the telephone
eight o'clock struck the crowd outside chanted with an increasing volume of sound revolt the other way
i tell gramma brought in
it was from the central comet rooms at nemesis
without a band he would not go and they had no bend
a quarter past ten half past
have you any band instruments of an easy nature to play
demanded the chief organizer of the prison governor drams symbols those sort of things
the orders have a private band of their own said the governor but of course i couldn't allow them in themselves
blends the instruments said a chief organiser
the popular song of the moment replied the agitator after a moment's reflection
it was a tune they had all heard hundreds of times so there was no difficulty in turning out a passable imitation of it to the improvised trains of i didn't want to do it the prisoners strode forth to freedom
the word of the sound had reference it was understood the incarcerating government and not to the destroyer of the albert hall
the seat was lost after all by a narrow maturity
the local trade unionists took offence at the fact of coin administers having personally acted as strike breakers and even the release of platter bath failed to pacify them
with that notorious failing of his he was not a sort of person one wanted in one's house
well the failing still exists doesn't it said the husband or do you suppose a reformer character is entailed along with

a wilfred van goat had covered himself with honors in the course of marlborough's companions and the name luff had been above dismal weakness in the family ever since the new heir to the family dignity and estates was a young man of about five and twenty who was known more by repetition than by person to alight circled cousins and kinsfolk

the talk fitted nervously and hardly from one impersonal topic to another
in the drawing room after dinner their nervousness and upwardness increased
oh we haven't shown you the silver wedding persons said missus pitter suddenly as those struck by a brilliant idea of her entertaining the guest here they all are
such nice useful yes a few replies of course
seven queen jugs put in peter
we feel that we must live unclean for the rest of our lives
of course some of them can be changed
i put it down by the clara said wilfrid busy with another object
vigilance was not completely crowned with a sense of victory
after they had said goodnight to their visitor missus petter expressed her conviction that he had taken something

it was a little present for my mother and myself for your silver wedding

husband and wife looked blandly and desperately at one another
it was missus peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there are thieves in the house we keep the drawing room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while we are at breakfast
she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not be stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later bearing a clean jug in her hands
the pigeon coats had turned paler than ever missus peter had a final inspiration
peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lived so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed within measurable distance
missus peter turned to her guest with confidential kindness
peter is little weakness a chancing the family good lord

then as archie stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he red the faint rustling once more and again all was silent
he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full of vexation injured em proper as the prince caller love of our own dignity of which archibald grey stroke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british officer had a pretty good stock
and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
calm mor came on this idea directly as he recalled the facts that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner and the power of a very reckless sit of people who would stop at nothing
no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would not me about
the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after the little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could
to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest pointed signal for help moss a boat's crew wary searching for him how to escape
the window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find the moseley fitted into the stone sill
next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old fashioned marble mantelpiece fireplace chimney
yes if other ways failed he could escape up the chimney
no that was too bad he cannot do that
sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hose were completely gone now and he said as teet fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot fur ever thinking about such people
a narrow table against the wall and two places
he went and tried to force his head through recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the body would pass
but there was no chance for his body there that he would not grow first
a fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
sure you l ground everywhere boy yes father quite
i'm going on the breakfast
shall i come too father no
stop here till sir risdon cur down until him im very sorry that we should have cleared our last night only a born fool saw jerry nandi lops boat going into the cove and came running to say it was a party from the cutter yes father
shall im not to be uneasy tis all right and i'll e everything clear away to night
the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin or archy race stroke way with his heavy eyelids pressed down by sleep
what a queer dream they thought to himself
but how queer for mister gurr to be talking like that to angry taal the boy who helps the cook
and why did andy call mister gurr father
there was an interval of thinking over this knotty question during which the low whistling went on
and i'm hungry too till i was up i suppose
no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint missed hung with reeds of smoke
what did they say false alarm tell servants then they would clear all away tonight see if anything had been left about lobster wrote
once out of that room he could ran and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunting down
oh those bars he mentally exclaimed and he was advancing towards them just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of bootes against stone work and ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young ship instead
there was the first to recover from the surprise
fo he said who
go round and open the door i was should him last night mistake
i saw you last nightin wondered whose boy he was
it was you father kicked for shirking and my well i hardly knowed you
nonsense
won't do said remembering
think i don't know you mister orficer
won't do said roam quickly i know you
replying the spire to a you be doing who walked you in
archie stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
he has gone to give the alarm fe the prisoner and he looked exceedingly round for away escape
nothing but the chiny presented itself
a happy inspiration had come and placing one end upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curved dirk glanced at the edge ran to the window and began to cut at one of the bars labor in vain
he divided the pain and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realized that the attempt was madness
the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear selling sound as he found it now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept un working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the dirk into a sheath
no i can't part with that ha ha laughed the boy jeeringly
fellow yes i'll give you a guinea if he will live me out
guiney said the boy think i'll do it her guinea w then too
be quick there's a good fowler i want to get away at once
not you only a sham
why your clothes don't fit you and your caps put on all scare
never mind about that let me out of this place
i told you a fisher boy cried och impatiently but trying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
not you look like a wild beast in a cage make a monkey you in soon
aren't you checked himself and the boy laughed
it was your turn yesterday it's mine today what a game
you laugh and fleered at me when i was on the cutter's deck
i say you do it like the lemon just like a big morgan a show
ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long low fit of laughter
you rope send me he said
why i could tie you up in a knot and heave you or fickle any day what a game
bit if a mighty fet on a salt tack and welly biscuit talk of giving me ropes and
once more will you come and let me out no
to his astonishment the board did not flinch but thrust his own arms through replacing him about the middy's waist clenching his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle
seeming it spirits last night mister gurr hay

but she failed the found of comfort he sought for anon continued in a more aggravated form
two months after this incident the same persecutors again entered our home in the day of the night and at the point of a pistol trod force my mother as set fire to her own home
i have always felt that the exposure to which she was subjected on this cruel journey too hard even for a man tate was a direct cause of a death

jag with a party of thirty season men charged the indiana guns and captured them but major foster led a gallant charge against the invaders and re captive the pieces
we were out of ammunition and more helpless at the fight men pressed
they did mart my clothes in one or two places however
major foster and a letter to judge george invented of minneapolis said
i was told that some of our men from the western bor of the state that they recognized a daring young rider as co younger

it was claimed by people of liberty that they paused a tilly recognised among the robbers all shepherd red mockers and bud pence who had seen service with quail
this ray was accompanied by bloodshed judge mc claying the banker being shot though not fatally

jean third eighteen seventy one og carte brother's banks at cordin hour was robbed at forty thousand dollars by seven men in broad daylight
it was charged that offen m coy or ahoy and myself had been participant in the gad's hill affair in the two stage robbers
the parts of this letter now relevant pars follows
you and use this letter in your own way
i will give you this outline sketch of my whereabouts and actions that's the time of certain robbers with which i'm charged
it's the time of the gallop and bank robbery i was gathering cattle and ellis county takes us cattle at up bought from plays tailor and rector
this can be proved of both of them also less here paring and fit the other respectable men of that county
i brought the cattle the cans of set fall and remained in saint clair county until february
then went to our consul return to saint clear county about the first of may
and went to kansas where our kettle burned woods and county and colonel ridges
during the summer i was either in saint clara jacks on her kansas but as there was no robber committed that summer it makes no difference where i was
and went their independence and from there two h whips
there i took dinner and then went the doctor ill w twins
our business there was to see ye he wished he was not at home but the family will remember that we were there
we crossed on the bridge stayed in the city all night and next morning we rode up through the sea
i met several of my friends among them was bab husband
we were not on the terns at the time nor have we been for several years
poor john he has been hung down and shot like a wild beast and never was a boy more innocent
doctor l louis was his physician
there were fifty or a hundred persons there who will testify in any court that john and i were there
held in fickle in wife of green toon valley or attending the springs at that time and either of them will testify to the above for john and i set him thought of mister smith's while he was preaching and was in his company for a few moments together with his wife and mister miss fickle after the service
about the lasted december eighteen seventy three i arrived in carol parish louisiana
i stayed there until the eighth of february eighteen seventy four
i had not heard of that when i wrote the letter of eighteen seventy four and to correct any misapprehension that might be created by meeting it i will say that at the time i was at neo kansas with a drove of cattle which i sold to major ray
it was immediately following the rock alan robbery at eight air iowa that their first appeared a delivered and listen of some local pipers and missouri to connect us with this robbery
i urged on the boys that whatever happened we should not sheer me one
the mill i crossed the bridge the three were on some dry good boxes at the corner near the bank and as soon as they saw us went riding to the bank instead of wedding for us to get there
when we came up att moa for shut the bank door which they had left open in the hurry
jee yes helen whose hard worst ow near try to go into the bank that miller ordered him away and he ran around the corner shouting
get your gun boys they're robbing the bank
and i called to him to get inside at the same time faring a pistol shouting the air as the signals of the three boys at the bridge that we had been discovered
almost at this instant i heard a pistol shot in the bank
chat weel woods and jim rode up and joins shouting to the feele in the street to get inside and firing their pistols to emphasize their commands
if any of our party shot him it must have been woods
meantime the street was getting uncomfortably hot
every time i saw anyone with a bead on me i would drop off my horse and try to drive the shooter inside but i could not see in every direction
doctor wheeler who had gone upstairs in the hotel shot miller and he lay dying in the street
changing his pistol to his left hand bob ran out and mounted millard's mayor
what kept you so long ey as pits
is to the rest of the affair inside of the bank i take the account of the north field narrator
where's a money outside to safe by that
the shots were closed and this cause bunker an instance delay that was almost fatal fits chasing with a bullet
the first one missed him but to second that through his right shoulder
that night it started to ring ne we wore out our horses
friday we move toward water bille and friday night we can't between elysian and german lake
bob shattered a bows requiring frequent attention and that night we made only nine miles and monday monday night in tuesday we spent in a deserted farmhouse close to man cato
that they am named dunning discovered us s we took him prisoner
finally we administered to him an oath not to betray our whereabouts until we had time to make our escape and he agreed noted
no sooner however was he released than he made post taste into manco to announce our presence and in a few minutes another posse was looking force
the whistle on the old mill blue and we feared that it was a signal that had been agreed upon to alarm the town in case we were observed but we were not malic
he had to sleep with it pillar on my breast jim being also cripple with a wound in his shoulder and we could not get much sleep
but they soon after got close enough so that one of them broke my walking stick with a shot
we were inside of our long sad horses when they cut us from the animals and our last hope was gone
six steps of the front sheriff lisping colonel t oval the elise graft c pomeroy and as j severs
forming in larn fall paces apart he ordered them to advance rapidly and concentrate to fire of the whole line the instant the robbers were discovered
make for the horses i said every man for himself
there's no use stopping to pick up a comrade here for we can't getting through the line just shar e and make it if we can
i got up as a signal for the charge and we fired one volley
one of the fellows in the outer line not brave enough himself to join the volunteers who had come in to be to south was not disposed to believe in the surrender and had his gun leveled on bob in spite of the handkerchief which was waving as a flag of troops
sheriff g lisbon of water one county who was taking bob's pistol from him was also shouting to the fellow
including those received in and on the way from north field i have eleven wounds
and caff lisbon order not to sheet was the beginning of the protector that mesa people established over us
captain murdock
but mar sport had flourished enough to kill it off
some of mars laws dated from the time when law force ment had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
the stonewall gang numbered perhaps five hundred
even dar lex and failures had to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which eat out some kind of a marginal living
they were safe from protection rackets there none bothered to come so far out
the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
captain murdock was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
the pressure was enough to get them for him
gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
i've got afraid hand and we're going to run this the way we would on earth
your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
the first man making a shake down we'll get the same treatment we're going to use on the stonewall boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
he picked out five of the men including gordon you five will come with me
the rest of you can teem up anyway you want tonight pick any rout the to open though came men lets go
bruce gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick and murdock's eyes fell on him earth cop
two years gordon admit it
for a second gordon cursed himself
he began wondering about security then
nobody had tried to get and touch with him
there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim phosphate ball glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
moving in two groups of threes it opposite sides of the street they began their beat
there was no chance to save the citizen who was drying from waco bear
gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned to club in his hands
gordon's eyes popped at that
he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
the other four cops had come in reluctantly
he brought him to the ground with a single blow crossed the kidneys
they rounded up the men of a gang and one of the cups started off
to find a phone and call the wagon
we not using wagons murdock toward him ly them up
if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were clubbed carefully
murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulder shaking and tears running down his cheeks
the captain's face was as sick as gordons felt
i want the name of every man and the gang ye can remember he told the man
colonel they'd kill me i don't know
murdock took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tufts
if he sh turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
trouble began brewing shortly after though
murdock sat one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
and the third one bu scorn spotted one of the men had been beaten before
get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
but the captain stirred finally sighing
now the copse they' giving me were covered gordon
but the stone walk gang as backing wain
but us goin to be tough on them
bruce gordon grimmest i've got a yellow ticket from security
murdock blanked he dropped his eyes slowly
what makes you think wain will be re elected
nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
ever see a martian election
no you're first her he can't lose
and then hell is going to pop in this whole planet may be blown wide open
it fitted with the dire predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner
cost a more but they be respectable
because izzie is always honestest according to have he sees it
but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
the groups grew more experienced and murdock was training a new squad every night
it wasn't exactly equal but nothing was here
this could lead to abuses as he'd seen on earth
but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor wane was re elected
it was night outside and the philosopher bobs at the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house
it had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down
and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that hadley system was working
gordon hit the signal switch and the mars speaker let out a shrill whistle
gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
you can't do it to me and
i'm reformed i'm going street
you damned cops kant omnia was blubbering
one look was enough the work papers had the tell tail over thickening of the signature they had showed up on other papers obviously forgeries
some turned away as gordon and the other cop went to work but most of them warn't squeamish
when it was over the two picked up their whimpering captive
jenkins the other cop had been holding the wallet
must have been making a big contact and something fifty fifty
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
when gordon and jenkins came back murdock tossed the money to them split it
whatever comes to han gov'nor
like this social call a gordon asked him
the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober noe
you are me some bills governor
eleven hundred fifty credits
you didn't pay up your pledge to the captain fund so i had a fill in
a thousand interest at ten percent a week standard right
gordon had heard of the friendly interest charge on the side here but he shook his head wrong is he
hah is he turned it over and shook his head
now show me where i signed any agreement saying i'd pay ye back
for a second izzie's face went blank then he chuckled
he poured out the bills and handed them over
thanks his e thanks yourself
the kid pocketed the money cheerfully nodding
the little guy knew mars as few others did apparently from all sides
and if any of the other cups had private rackets of their own izzie was undoubtedly the man to find it out and used the information with a beat such as that even going halves and with all the graft to the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped into the bench
go on except dam it
there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
the little publisher was back at the crusader again
only gordon and sheila were left
credit had been established again and the businesses were open
gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwelling spilt like the dome but opaque for privacy
they have been lucky
schubert's volunteers were official now
f's place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
he reached automatically for the class of ether needler
thought ye'd be in the chips
that's mars gorner the other's comment why don't you pull off the planet fats you could go back to earth i'd guess father nodded
guess a man gets use to anything hell maybee i can hire some bumps to sit around and whoop it up when the ships come in and bel this is a real old martian den of sin
there was a grin on the other space
finally got out orders for you it's mercury
we sent ty others a same way and they failed
let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
you can't stay here
there's a rocket waiting to tranship you to the man on the way to mercury right now gordon sighed
and i paid her the pay we owe you from the time you begin using your beds she's out shopping
but his old eyes were glinting
did you think we'd let you go without seeing off cover he asked
i i oh dreaded i'm getting old izzie you tell him
he grabbed gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank izzie shook his head
any colchester had begun to make prince with leslie
lesly determined to tripe upon us an english language and literature
her tastes all way in the duration her idea being v by to follow her mother's proficient of gerish for which he already showed considerable aptitude
she had no idea if allowed herself to break down
what do you mean replied easily

said annie a flesh of light coming into her eyes and in leaving him
but she added abruptly you speak of something which must not take place
i must passen honors if i don't i shall die
a fewer was later there came a cap at the door
lizzie opened the door
jane harriot stood without
these letters have just come for you and any halts does she said and as i was come upstairs i thought i would leave him with you
busily banter and eagerly grasped the little parson
her eyes shone with pleasure at the anticipation of the delightful time she would have revelling in the home news the other letter was directed to any colchester

her face grew suddenly watch as death what is it there
i have been starling or rather i have been thirsting

leslie seated herself with her back to her companion and opened her o letters

i must go into the grounds the air stifling
but they are just shutting up
i shall go i know away
just up in midnight she rose with a sigh to prepare forbid
she looked round the room
now i remember she got a letter which upset very much and went out
leslie fed to the window and flung it open she put her head out and tried to peer into the darkness but the moon had already said and she could not see more than a cup of yards in front of her
she is a very queer the rated creature and at letter there was bad news in their letter
why can't you doing out by yourself
lesly left the room but she had scarcely gone a dozen places down the corridor before she met any returning
andy eyes were very bright her cheeks were no longer pale and there was a brilliant color in
she did not take the least notice of ladling but going into the room shut the door
don't begin said annie
don't agin what do you mean
i mean that i don't want you to begin to ask questions
i walked up and down as fast as ever i could outside in order to ma myself sleepy
don't talk to me listing don't see a single word
i shall go off to sleep that is all i careful

now princess at once she said in a voice of authority if you really wish to sleep
annie stared vacantly in the cooker benjy uttered a laugh
drank bad she said
you want to kill me don't talk any more
i am sleeping i shall sleep
she got into bit as she spoke and wrapped the cloaks cutty round her
cut you manage with a candle just for once
certainly said ed lastly
she turned up the light a letter candle which she put behind her screen dim prepared to get and beard
andy's manner was very mysterious
annie did not mean to confine in anyone that night and the kindest thing was to leap there alone
tie it out busily yourself propped asleep
annie is that you she called out
there was no reply but the sound of hurrying steps came quicker and quicker now then they interrupted by a groan
oh this will kill me my heart will brack this will kill me
the gold of saint elizabeth
immediately after t that evening leslie ran up to her room to make preparations for
i'm not coming said e

but don't lock me out please any
oh i will lock you out she said but i must have the key
jane hear it's voice was heard in the passage
as she walked down the corridor she heard it being turned to the lock
what can thus mean she did to herself
oh i would pris you replied jane

some day jane you must see her
