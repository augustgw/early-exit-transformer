this ion they say in all ab blood and a graining or two perhaps his goods but is he ma mea harshly feel has got a little too much of steele an none
margaret said mister hale as he returned from shone hissed down stays i cannot help watching no face with some anxiety when mister thornton lady his confession of having been a shop boy
you don't mean that he thoughts so silly
are rely like that account of himself but to than anything else he said
he statement of having been a shut boy was the thing like best the w
you who always accusing people of been shop he at heston
o don't thing mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a persons to u that tons what he had been
a really was very much afraid of showing him how much sho i that some part of what he said
his father tinging miserable circumstances
why it might have been in the work hast
his father speculated wildly failed and then co himself because he could not bear the disgrace
all his former friends sharp from the discloses that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money g gain his ow mer portion of worth
no one came fords to helped the mother and this boy
at least no friend came forwards mealy and mister thornton is not one i fancy to wait till ti kindness comes to fin her out
so they lef mon
how tainted asked her father
op par by that testing everything by the standard of worth
when he spoke of them mechanical powers he evidently looked up them only as news of extending trade and making money
and the poor in around him theyll poor because they were vicious out of the pale of be sympathies because they i had nos ion nature and the capabilities that it gub rich
not vicious he never said that
in provided so indulgent were his words
margaret was collecting her others working materials and preparing to goat to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to mak an acknowledgement which she thoughte would please of father but which to be full and true must included little and mince
however outed came
pap i do thinks thornton a very remarkable man but person i dont like him at
sh i do said her father laughing
first me as he call it and all
i don't s him up for aure or anything of that kind
but good not child
there was sevil other science of something run about missus hale
she had dixon held m steer consultations in the bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was accustom when any distress of her mistress called up upon her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chambers soon after dixon lifted and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stall out she could a few words which were event a pay strength i patience to indue of vodrey
but though shere receive presses and for word's back again in such profusion as would have glad in her formerly yet she thought but there was a secret with held from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
she law very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence with they milt and life on her mother
a servant to give dixon permit assist should be got if she gave up the whole times of the search and then at any rate the mother might have all the personal attention shere required and had been accustomed to whole life
visiting register offices sing all manner of unlikely people and veryain least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she met b he h cans in the street and stopped to speak to her
well busy howe you
bitter and not better if you know what that means
not exactly replied margaret's smiling
i lure in not being to pieces by caving the nights brown we entred a milton and longing to get away to the lan ber and when i think c father and father off hard sinks none no better i worse
margaret turn round to walk along side of the girl in her fable progress homeward
of for a mineral too she did not speak
at last shes said in low voice
missy you wish to die
b he was slant in her turned for mineral too then shere replied
nor worst than many others are reckon
but what was it
i'm strange here so perhaps are not soir quick at u standing what you mean as if if i'd lived or my life in milton

feverish col came into a cheeks and the feverish flame into a her ey
but you bere there father he shallow oh the heart

margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to reis up the bosom
presently the spas that four shadow death had passed away and busy roused the so and said

even if there was what a time when owing the low standards of morals on the disposition of ment violence the existence of authority to restrain such vales was an advantage because the violence of the goverment was lesson the violent of individuals one carp se that this advantage couldn be lasting
between the members of one state su to single authority the tripe between that individuals seemed still less and a life of the state seems even m acre
it was produced on one hand by the natural gr of the populations and on the other by struggling conquest
after conquest the power of the emperor puts an e in aw ascensions and so sta conception of live justified itself

this increases cages as montescue pin o luton for the years ago
every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self offs against its subjects becomes sort of danger for neighboring states and calls for similar increase in their armies
the despotism of a government always increases with strength of the armies exiles successes and egress of this of a goverment increases with its internal despotism
the rivalry of the your ape pan states and constantly increasing their forces has reduced them too the necessity of having recourse to universal mary service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers his obtained least possible express
and by this means all citizens are under arms support the inequities practiced upon them all citizens had become their own impress
this inconsistency as the come obvious and universal thir service
in fact the hol sign gant of the social concession of life consistent mans reuniting of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transits of personal life itself and the trans france of the aim of life the groups of persons

without the state men would not have been able to form social institutions needed for doing anything

captain murdock
but mars port had flourished enough to kill it off
some of mars laws dated from the time when long force ment hadad been hampered by lac of men rather than by the tape of men
the stone lon gang numbered perhaps five hundred
even dare lax and failures head to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which e d out some kind of a marginal living
they were safe from protection rack a tears there none booted to come soir far out
the shot keepers and some of the less un fortunate people there had protest tol enough to reach clear back to earth
captain murdo was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
the pressure was enough to get them for him
gord reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixt with a vague relief
i've got a free hand and were goin to run this the way we on earth
your job to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel ike it or not no graft
the first man making a shake down will get the same treatment were goin to use on the stone wall boys you'll get doublet pay here and you can live on it
she picked out five of the men including gorden you five will come with me
the rest of you can t up anyway you want nighte pick any r the to open tho came and m
brast gordon grin slowly as he swung a stick and mar's eyes fell on him earth cot
two years gord amut
for second gorden cursed himself
he began one during about security then
nobody had tried to get and touch with him
there was a crude laying system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim fs for ball glad when darkness fellow they would have nothing else to see by
moving into groups of threes that opposite sides of the street they began their beat
there was not chians to save the citizen he was dying from lack a be
gorden felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands
corn's eyes popped that
he swaller the sentiment his own club was moving now
the other four cops had come in reluctantly
he brought him to the ground with was a single blow crossed the kids
they rounded up the men of a gain and one of the cop started off
to find of firm and called a waggon
were not using wagons ma told him line a upo
if they tried to r they were hit from behinds they stood still they were club carefully
murdo indicated one who stood with shoulder shaking and tears runing downest cheeks
the captain's face was a sick as gordons felt
i want the name of every man in the gan he can remember he told the man
colonel they killed me i don't knowe
murdo tok his nod as evidence enough and turned to the watched tuff
if he sh turn up dead i'll know you boys a responsible and i'll finde you
troubled began bring shortly
murdo sat one of the man topick up a second squad of six and then a third
and the third one br scorn spotted one of the men had had been beaten before
get structure and take him wherever he belongs heered
but the captain stirred finally sighing
now the cops are giving me were covered gordon
but the stone walking as backing wain
but going to be t on them
bis gorden grist i've got yellow tick it from security
mara blanked he dropped his e slowly
what make you think wain will be re elected
nobody wants him accept again of crooks and those and power
ever se a marsh election
n your firste he can't loose
and then hellas going top and this whole plan may be blown wi o anden
y fitted with the dia predictions of security and with the spyin gordon was going to do according to them
he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair rest around the corner
cost a morn but they be respectable
because is he is always honest according to have he sez its
but you got e ideas of the stuff like i had once
the groups grew more experienced and maro was tring a new squad every nights
it was an exactly le equal but nothing was here
this goodly to abuses as he seen on earth
but there probably wouldn be time fort if mayre wan re elected
there was nighte outside and the fop bobs at the corners col dimly giving him bar enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized piecing toes
it had probably been years since any hadad dared rest get after the sun wat down
and the slowed doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was evened more proof that hay system was working
gord hit the signal switch and the mars speaker let out a shrill whistle
gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
you can't do it to me
i am reformed i'm going street
you damned cops can a mea was blubbering
one look was enough the work papers had the tell tale over thickening of the signature they had showed up on other papers obviously forgeries
some turned aways gord in the other cent tow work but most of them on scream
when it was over the too picked up their w bering captive
chinks the other cop had been holding the wallet
must been making a big contact and something fifty fifty
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
when gordon and jenkins came back ma tossed the money to them split it
whatever comes to hand go na
like this serial call gord asked him
the little man shook his head his ancients eighteen year old face turning sober no
you are me some bill's governor
eleven hundred fifty credits
e didn't pay up plug to a captain fond so i had a fill
a thousand interest at teem per s a week stander right
gord had heard of the friendly interest charge on the side here but he sick his head wronging his he
ha is he turned it over and shook his head
now sh me were i signed in agree that saying i pay back
for ast second iss face went blank then he chuckled
he poured out the bills and handed them over
thanks his thanks yourself
the kid pocketed the money cheerfully noding
the little gid new mars as few others did apparently for from m sides
and if pear the other cops had private racks of their own is he was undoubtedly the man to findin it out and ms the informations with a beat such as that even going halfs and with all the graf to the upper brackets he'd still bea able to make his pile in and a matter of months
the captain lu completely beaten as he came into the ran and dropped into the bench
gol on accept de it
there was in mean coming from earth on a seconds ship who would see him
the little publisher was back at the crusader again
only gorden and shea were left
credit had been established again and the businesses were open
gordon came to ar row of temporary bubbles individual dwelling spot like the down but opake the privacy
they have been lucky
show burs volunteers were af shied now
fats place was still open though the cricket tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
he reached automatically for the class e needle beer
thought you be the chips
thats mars go ack though comments wh she pu off the plant thats you could go back to earthy guess thet their nod
guess a man gets us too anything hell mab ian higher some bumps to sit around and wooed it up when the ships come and bough this is a red martian den of sin
