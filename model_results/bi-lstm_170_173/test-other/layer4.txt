there's i and they say in all our blood and a greal two perhaps is good but he he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel an n
margaret said mister hale as he returned from show his guests downstairs i couldn help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thornton made his' confession of having been as shopboy
you don't mean that you thought me so silly
i really like that account of himself butcher than anything else he said
his statement of having been a shopboy was a finger like best the war
you who were always accusing people of be shop he at helstone
i don't think mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was that some part of what he said
his father dying in miserable circumstances
why it might have been in the work house
his fathers speculated wildly failed and then kill himself because he could not be the disgrace
all his formal friends shun from the discloses that had to be made of his disc s gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to gain his own mice portion of wealth
no one came forwards to help the mother and this boy
at least no friend came forwards immediately and mister thornton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
so they lift milton
how tainted asked her father
o papa by that testing everything by the standard a worth
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
and the poor men around him there a poor because they were vicious out of the pair of be sympathies because they had not his ion nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
not vicious he never said that
improvident and self indulgent were his words
margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought were please her father but which to be full and true must included little annoyance
however out it came
papa i do think mis the thornton a very remarkable man but person i don't like him at all
he i do said her father laughing
personally as he called it and all
i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
but good night child
there was several other science of something wrong about missus hale
she had dixon held and stars consultations in a broom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was accustom when any distress of her mistress called up upon her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chambers soon after dixon lifted and found her mother on her knees and as margaret's stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to injure severe bodily suffering
but though she received presses and f words back again in such profusion as would have glad in her formerly yet she felt but there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
she lay wet very longest night planing how to lessen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
a servant give dixon permanent assistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attention she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
visiting register officers seeing all manner of unlikely people and veryain few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she met bessy he gins in the street and stopped to speak to her
well busy how are you
better and not better if you know with that means
brought exactly replied margaret smiling
i better in not being ton pieces by cuffing the nights but i wei and tired o milton and longing to get away to the lo ber and when i think i farther and father off i heart sinks none no better i'm worse
margaret turned round to walk g side of the girl in her feeble progress homeward
but for a minute two she did not speak
at last she said in a low voice
bessy do you wish to die
bessy was silent in her turned for minute or too then she replied
nor worse than any others are reckon
but what was it
you know i'm a stranger here s pert s i'm not so quicker um standing what you mean as if i'd lived my life in milton
i had forgotten wor i said for the time continued margaret quietly
i should have thought of it again when i was less busy we'll go with you now
the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful lin as she mit margaret's soft and friendly gaze
as they turned up into a small court opening out into a squalid street bey said
you will not be du to de fathers at home and speaks pit graf fish at first
but nichols was not at home when they entered
pass bessy at last
pit tok a long and feverish draught and then full back and shut her eyes
margaret bent g and said bessy don't be impatient with your life whatever it is may have been
remember who gave it to and made what it is
now i'll not have my wench preach to
but shawls in margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of left it was to be
i believe where sey and no more
that's what i believe young woman
i don't believe all i here no not by big deal
but whose come at less and whose welcome as long as who will keep them preaching on what he knows not about
its simple are not far to fetch nor h to work
but the go and you played the mor was margaret
during hardly is a good mani is
i sometimes think ill shall be merk with sorrow evening the city of god if father is not there
the feverish color came into a cheeks and the feverish flame into all ey
but you'll be there father you shall oh my hart
she put her round to it and became ghastly pale
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest on her bosom
presently the spasm that f shuddered death had passed away and busy roused the soft and said
i'll go to bed it's best place but catching that margaret's gar you'll come again i know you will but just say it
oh come to morrow said marred
margaret went away veryain sad and thoughtful
she was late for teet home

everybody also had there turned at this great difficulty n let me try
i may be the singer put on the slipper after all

perhaps she read have re relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
she sounded to be such care for economical person that i should like anyone out off the same family

he reason lat if for emptied out of the preserving pan into earth pan is that the anson acts upon the copper of which to preserving pans are usually made

then he explained to jean von that this was his recompense for a service which he fl all was to render to the community
that the n who had ding that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the fault under the altar of the chapel

jean valjean had been in wor straight the ms
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
to have himself nailed i in a case and carriage off like a bale of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to economize his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean's blue me talents
we surely must have agin youll will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nay on the top plan upon loosely good and what if you should happen to calf to seas
a man who is making his escape does not cot or sneeze
who is there who is not said to a cat do come in
the over prudent cats as they are and because they at cans sometimes incur more danger than the audacious

on the fall and day as the sun was declining the veryain rare passes by on the bi lady men hulled up their hats to an old fashioned hurst ornamented with skulls crass brons and tears
this hurst contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a hing corpse with drooping ars
a morning coach in which could be seen a priest in his surplus and a quire boy in his red cap followed
behind it came in all man in the garments of a laborer who limber along
the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at might and winter in this cemetery they were subjected to a special discipline
these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hangs at the instant when the son disappeared behind the dome of the invalid
dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it
the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the va hart it hinted at poverty plea shames if you peas
to be buried in peru shes is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognized as elegant

make as many lords as you please men but keep them for yourselves
a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
formable limped along behind the harse in a veryain contented frame of mind
jean valjean's composure was one of this powerful tranquillity which are contagious
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
he played with father mien
he did what he knighted with him he made him dance according to his wind
the permission for interment must be exhibited
he was a sort of labor in m who w waistcoat with large pockets and carried a matter under his arm
the man replied the greve digger
the gav dinner yes

father mess chien is the grave digger he was
flushing one had expected anything but this but a greve digger could die
it is true nevertheless that gravediggers do dine themselves
he had hardly the strength to stammer
but he persisted feebly father mast and is the grave digger
do you know who ale father l lars here isn't jug of red wine
but youre a joy fell
i you not comer we'll go have a drink together presently
the man replies
he limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity
the grave digger walked on in front him
fresh of one past the unexpected kavi once more and review
fresh thea v who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to dear with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
the are father mess inns dead
the man replied completely

they only a few churns of the william distant from the small ary leading to the nun's corner
and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well
fortunately the soil which was light and weet with the winter rains clog the wheels and retried its speed
my father was a porter at the pretty e ton home
but he have reverses he had losses on change i was obliged to renounce the professions of af but i am still a publick writer
but so you are not a grave digger then

a fs l was up his anguish offered a drank but he did not explain himself on one point who was pay
the grave digger went on with a superi smile
one must eat
the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake
yes but if i should already ask for something what
well do it for me v swear to you thy don't love you as the others have loved you

i don't know how it is but it's seas to nance if i do
i'll go i can't keep my eyes open
it seems to me as if this sleeping city be longs to me i searched my memory for the names of those whose happiness i had once envied and i couldn not recall one without finding myself the happier
education fly feeling the says of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sen meals so visual as not to be deceived fire girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first cast of love all the more arden because these seen so pure
the more girl believes in goodness the more isle will she give way if not tor lover at these to love for being without mistrust she is without force and to would her love as a triumph that can be gained by any young men of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
then how surely must they desire the worlds which is hidden from them how shy must be find it tempting how surely must be listened to the first' voice which comes to tell its secrets through their bars un bless the hand which she is the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil
with them the body has worn out the soul the senses half burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
they loved by profession and not by instincts
when a creature who has all her past to reproach herself with token all at once by a profound sincere irresistible love of which she had never felt herself keeps when she has confessed her love how absolutely the man whom she loves dominates her
they know not to what proof to give
in order to disturbed the laborers in the fields was one day devoured by wolf because those whom he had so often deceived the long of the leaf in his cries for help
this is the same with these unhappy woman would be love seriously
but when the man who inspires this redeeming love its great enough and soul to rested it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one dro all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
but to returned to the first day of mal s
whenever home i was in the state of mad get
the woman become as the man's mistress and loves him
how why
my whole being was exalted ino joy at the memory of the words yet exchanged dinging that first night
here on my orders to night at the boville
condemn a third and tract
the boxes filled one afro another
only w remained empty the stage box
at the beginning of the thirds act i heard the door of the box on which by eyes had been almost constantly fixed opened and marguerite appeared
do she loved me en to believe that a more beautiful she looks the happier i should e
what is the mag with you to night said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
who should go to bed she replied with that ironic error which went so well with her delicate and witty face
where at home
you still love me can you ask
because you don't like seeing him
then less i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and margery gen into the carriage which was winning for them at the door
i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
you and the way marguerite but how
well you might have had woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see too more arrive
during this remark marguerite and looked at me attentively
my dear prudence i answered you did not know what you are saying
yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as as my dor you w w to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
because i am watched and the least suspicion might to me the greatest harm
is that really the only reason
if there were and other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
on sleep do you care for me a little a great feld
i fancied for a moment th i might give myself that happiness for sits months you will not have it you insisted ony the means
well good heavens the means were easy enough guess
i listened and i gazed their marguerite would admiration
when i thought that this marvelous creature whose feet i had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in their thoughts by part in her life and that i was not yet content with was she gave me i asked if m desire had indeed limits when s spied as probably as mine had been it reached after something further
truly she conceded we poor a creatures of chance have fasted desire and in conceivable loves
we are not allowed to have hearts under pali of thing hooded down and of ruining are credit
we no longer long to ourselves
who stand first in their self stain last in their steam
never do g you advise which is not lucrative
it me little en of to them that w shan have ten lover's extravasation of bristling all of them and that they can drive and are para from time to time or come to our box at future
such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and old a is mither protects mor consols
i thought i couldst the life which he offered me o what would you you have
what i loved you was not the m who was but the m who was going to be
marat hired out with this long confession through herself fact on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough pe her the chief tor lips and from that tor her eyes
marguerite do with me as you will i amr slave your dog but the name of heaven ter up the letter which are roe to you and did not made me leave you to morrow it would kill me
marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile infinite sweetness said
here it is i have brought the back
i toward letter into fragment and kissed with tears the hand that gav to me
look here prude do you know what he wants said marguerite
he want you forgive him
one has too but he once more than that what then
i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled

it was his fancy i suppose to revive certain sentimental relations which had it may be once existed between him and miss lake and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnified an objection proportion as its pursuit is thor it
the story of freed deen and wretches pretty outlines
sit down beside me and i'll tell you the story
he existed at it but took no part and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its su pleasant gabled and laughter like c a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance

forthwith the grinning juster began sure king with laughter so that the bells upon his motley cap were all s a jangling
i did but laughed to think the sort of e lari had been so quickly founded responded the gesture and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailors girdle
one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes
thou shall have thy liberty he cried even though thou shuts run me in pieces the moment thou'rt free
y had had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful very with filmy wings but shone like rainbows in the moonlight
at this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten
scissors growed giants ian save us from the ogs might
he could see the ogre standing powerless to het him on the other side of the casa and nash as teet each one of which was his big as a mill still
the side was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast and speak could carry him
thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this dismal spot well i have the power to help bee
he lifted the scissors and with one stroke dried the webb and gave the flights read e
a think glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole
the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable first to say to the scissors
as he uttered the words the scissors looped out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shutters as easily as through a shes
in a veryain short time the prince and crawled p the opening
while he stood looking around him and bewilderment a firefly lighted down his hm flashing its little leg in the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me d gude who place of safety

he affirmed to himself that he would not he d declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
to stand between two religions from one of which he would not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to that like souls
marius was clear eyed and he required the true light
the half light of doubted him
whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march furthers
he feared after having taken se many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should a strange him from that father
his discomfort was augment by all the reflections which occurred to him
in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
they soon elbowed him abruptly
request co fact to come and talk with me said marius
what is to be come of you said ker
what are you going to do i do not know
silver gold here it is
you will then have only a pair of trousers a weskit a hat and coat and my boots
that will be enough
no it is not good what we do after that

it is badly paid work but one can of by it
the closed deer was sent for
he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments they went to the watchmakers
he bought the watch her forty five francs
hello i've forgotten that said marius
the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot
i have ten franks left said marius
that will be swallowing a tongue very ivery fast or a hundreds veryain slowly
one morning on as return from the law soo marys found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistol that is to say six hundreds franks and gold and the sealed box
maria sent back the thirty louis to aunt with the respectful letter in which he stated that he had suspicion means of subsistence and that he should be able bins forth supply all his knees
at that moment he had mew franks left
he perceived that it was no good talking to the old men and at the principal person in the house was the mother
be fore her he decides as cater his pearls
the princess was distracted and d dot know whats to do she felt she had send against ky
well doctor decide our fate said the princess tell me everything
he there hope she m me to say but her looks quivered and she could not outer the question well doctor
as he way the princess w not of the sigh
the family doctor respectfully ceased a itll of his ovation
and there are in occasions metric nervous in excitability and so long
the questions sin thus in piss of indications of to bulus process what is to be done to maintain intrusion
yes set an understood thing responded the c elated physician again to winging his watch
by pardon is the os g berg dia or shall af the drave
he asked ah it is

and how about it to broad asked the c doctor
what is wanted as the mean of approving attrition enough lowering
the family doctor lessen attentively and respectfully
but in favor of fore and travel i would urs the change of habits the removal from conditions ton e panics
and then the mother wishes it he had

the selby to doctor announce to the princess a feeling if what was doe from him they pated his doing so that he ought too seat ovation once more
oh no only if fe dids princess home this way
and the mother of company by the doctor went into the drawn room to katy
when the doctor came and she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with theirs
she answered in and all at once got up furious
it hes me doctor but there is really ne logic inn
this is the thir tim you've ass me the same thing
the celery to doctor did not take offence

and the doctor began side the it they explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the conditions of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the taking of the waters which are certain the h
at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged int the de meditation as though resolving awaiting ba
finally his decision was banc they were to go rada but to put no fate and foreign clacks and to applied

the mother was much more cheerful as she went back to a daughter and kan ey regent to be more cheerful
educated equal of the upper closes are trying to stifle ever growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social l
this is absolutely int erects
in the social conceptions of life is suppose the since the a of life found and groups of individuals individuals will fall untied sacrifice their own interest for the interest of the group
the champions of the social conception of light usually try to connect the idea authority that is of violence with the idea moral andes but disconnection is quite impossible
the men who was controlled by moral influence ax and accords with his own desires
the bases of authority boy whiles
the possibility of applying bodily violence the people is provided above all by an organisation of armed men trained to act in unison and submission to one will
these band of armed men said missus to a single will are what costive the army
the army has always been and still he the basis of power
power is always in the hands of those who control yard an almo power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything can court popularity of in the ay knowing that if that is on their side their power secure
indeed it could not be otherwise
only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
the since this is not the case and on the contrat men and power always far from being sings through the very fact their possession of power the social organization bason power has no justification
even if there was want to time when owing to the low standards of morals on the disposition men of violence the existence of an authority to restrain such vales was an advantage because the violence of the government was lessen the violent of individuals one cannot at see that this advantage could not be lasting
between the members of one state subject a single authority the tri between the individual seemed still less and a life of a state seems even m to cure
it was produced on one hand by the natal growth the population and on the other by struggle and conquest
after conquest the power of the emperors puts an end to inter ol dissensions and so the state conception of live justified itself
but this justification is ne more than temporary
internal ascensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression deserted by the authority over the d sentient individuals
govern authority even if d suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of viols which tend to become greater greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
and therefore the oppression of the oppress always goes on growing up the furdest lamon beyond which a cannot g that killing the goose with the goldens
the most convincing example this is be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient time seeded that conquest
so is always been
footnotes the fact that in america the muses of authority exist in spite of a small number of their troops not only fails it disprove this position de positively confirms it
the ever class know that an army if f the thousand will soon be insufficient and do longer belong on incitants men they feel that this curate of their positions depends on the incas drink of the army
the reason to which he gave expressions essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the pops engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of the day so carefully distribute the repos so that the regiments from the frontier their stationed and central districts and the regiments from the centre our station on the frontiers
the meeting of c privy speech put ino plan language is that funds needed nots his fig those but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the in slave toiling masses
and this had normal order of thanks is maintain by the army
but there is not only one hem there other governments i exporting their such by violent in the same way and are always ready to pounds down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its insulate subjects
u so every goverment needes an army also the products boy from its nator brigands
this increases contagious as montescue pined a hatred fet the years ago
every increase in the army one state with the aim of self defence against it subjects becomes a sort of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase of their armies
the despotism of the government always increases with his strength of the army and external successes and the restiveness of a government increases with its internal despotism
the rivalry of the european states and constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers who obtained at the least possible express
and by this means all citizens are under arms support the iniquities practised upon them all citizens had become their own impress hers
this inconsistency as become obvious and universal fire service
in fact the whole significant of the social conception of life consists in mans addition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitory ins of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life the groups of persons
the with universe amy service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to give it of the cruelty of strife and the in security of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had me to avoid
but inst of doing that they exposed to individuals to the same necessity of strife substitute strike with individuals of other states for strife with neighbours
the taxes raised from the people for war preparations ab sor of the great depart in the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
the danger of war ever ready de break rin is all reforms of by social light vain and fruitless
with the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherit in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
government assert that armies are new above all for a external defence with that is not true
there are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military serbs the comes accomplice in all that ax of violence are the govern against the citizens without any choice of his own
and for the sake of whit h mak them
i expected for the sake of a state to make the sacrifices to rence everything that can be precious man peace family security and h m dignity
except the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil dispose persons in our own country
we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish the number that be can only be done by change of and marmy and moral influence
so that the justification of stained violence on the ground of the protection a gives from evil dispose persons evening of it had some foundation three of for centuries ago has none whatever know
except the state they tells we should not have any religion education culture me a punic so on
without the state men would not have enable to form the social institutions needed for doing anything
this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made m complete the able to dispense with state eight in fons societies associations corporations and congresses re scientific economic and political objects
without governments nations were bein late by their neighbours
the government they tell us with its army is necessary defended from nator stay to might and slavs
an if defence against barbarous nations meant one thousand parts of the troops now under aunts would be ale sufficient with that purpose
the power of the state bar from being a security against attacks of our neighbors exposes on the contrary the much grater dangerous such tax
evened looking at e practically wegg that is to say all the burdens lat on him by the states no man can failed to see that for him personally to complied with a state de mans and servant the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantages than to youse to so
to resist would need independent thought of effort of which every man is not capable
so much for the advantages disadvantages the both lines of conducts for a man of the wealthy class an oppressor
for a man of the poor working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with the great increase disadvantages
say you now supper
chris licked from m com plated flashlight to a car jack c spark plug

christi off once more passing a bleak little victory and church perch on hill of mister work's house
and e ante lot cut e int to by church lan gave a look of isolations of they shake pic building it sir mister wicker's both house and place at business
the longer winging towards the back got a back door that open on a water street the space between the house in this gone site into a meat up along flower garden fenced off for the sidewalk by box shrugs and the white picket fence
el livid yellow stain of arise indo the factories and blaye clouds lowered and tumbled above
the air was growing chill and christ decided the finish the job
all that once you wondered how his mother was in everything in am pinched and tighten itself
at the foot of the hill he reached the house
there were three things that always caught his eye a me the litter of dusty pieces
wh they left the coil of rope in the centered the motte of a sailing ship in a grain glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of the negro boy and bating trousers turkish jacket and whit turban to
but the name still showed the pow and many a time christ safe at hole and bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mabel t
he had never seen anyone go int to mister hook's shop know he thought bed
how then did limp and what did ever sell
a sudden car horn walk him from his dream
of the many times yous amon mister re furs when no and poured it over the rope the ship in the nubian boy he had never gone ino mister hooker's shop
some now alone till some mention answer that bell they looked eagerly y uneasily around him to
what with one windowed the lower outside the longed narrow shop with sombre
head the handing beams crossed it from one side to the other
mister okar's back being toward the source of light quest c not sey his face
the double fans of minute wrinkles breaking from ee cory a temple and joining with those over the sheep bones were drawn into the hors lines across the dome fore head
little toss some white fuse above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarians hair but what drew and held chris's gaze were the old men's eyes
crisp lin to look again yes they were still there
chris swaller it vice came back
y sir he said
i s your sign and i know boy who eats the jog
hes a scammon min
gears name is new really is the job
i i just wondered if the pe was to lob
what he saw was a fresh cheek lad tall for thirteen story listen sit and good humour his face and something sense it in an appealing about his eyes
and guess there must be lively fire that run beyond
with that have fear with jakie gig skinning the job sir
but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mindes why do d do not seen the reflection of the headlights at the car as moving bo around the crier of wall of your street up the hill towards the ethic signals
the roam seemed overly still
then in that secondly turned and faced about
the wide bow w there was there before him and three objects he like best showing frosty the moonlight that toward in from across of water
gr water what was a free way
it was no long gr there nor with a high walls and smoke stacks of backer to be seen t
but where houses were still there
flabbergasted and breathless chris was u aware that the at moved closer appear out the windows and every direction
no electric signs no lap oft streets
for the people's dro store and stood but half an hours before rose the roofs of what was evidential an inn
a courtyard is firstly that by flinging torture too shilling the swinging side hung on the post
the posts plenty at the edge of which was now prod in money rad
the coach that stop piled hive with legged stamp to a hale beside the flight court card
they moved into the end the coach rattled off to the stale
by window has a per for those few are to see
the learning of magick was by means easy
you told his master at once he got sime and gos his hod of money is hiding places for it
christ therefore threw himselfe of all the primaries of his tasks
one afternoon when he had returned lef to arrest to mister winks study he saw that there was something new in the room a b with a goldfish it stood on the table that mister works not to be seen
what it all i do first
how you of been pro with my boy it exclaimed it' th time for you to try missus is good a change any
supper chained and ketch and back
mister worker wed patiently decided for a few moments for christo up his courage
then is nothing happen with a voice like a whip mister riggs stat at ponce
a sensation spread faster and faster
his head swam any felt faint no little sick but he persisted through the final words
he thought n with thout a feeling a pride in commences experimenting with his tale and fins with such enthusiasm and to light some little time lapped be wore mister worker his voice boom but os by
seventy four book one returned
the figure shoes carved ands easter and style at curved the pointing toes
that all at once the idea came to chris
if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
he squatted on his haunches sa havin the car to wooden figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive of the boy would be an ideal and happy companions
but how did one a change in adamant to an of it
gris got up and stole back to mister works door
he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his broome above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the rome was reeling empty we sir giles proper shape and open the doors of the covered to far int of the room
the afternoon raining before increased in storm
thus came too hours before its time thunder snarled in the sky
certain elements were be mixed and port the proper time
mister worker began moving about upstairs the full boards creaked p and still chris could not leave until the fut fumed and glowed
with infinite caution chris closed the doors silently behind him in running light before ward greeks the figure of the negro boy
it was is at the sty mess melted
under his eyes wasn't folds of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its rounding upon the coat and oh the face
the wind grin lucent the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of car flowers moved a the boca ful
they went down to their corner's first
guess mister finny went to his quarters i don't number seeing him cross deck who come over that why at all
next net silly was really into the helm by over jonesy took over her net w on down
it looks to me as if it could been been one of several people and i'll be switched i no who what gib eyes o and
the mabel was nearing toity

christ lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down was cabin
certainly my boy boomed out the captain as blue eyes abruptly keen and pen train
mister finny one be some time on deck we cannot be own heard in here
his face rose with nervousness that this might dol do as an answer and he stood stiff and stone before captain lizards
the captain sat forward in his chair looking at in for a long moment considering
then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say i do
the ship had more to mean wife or mover all family
in paws fingering this lower lip the looking side in an aft of fashion at christ standing before him
we shall say no more but i trust you under stand responsibility you have
a ship it's cargo in its m will be in your hands
y sir i think i can do it safely or should not try sir
captain lizards round pink faced creased in its winning smile
y then went on to descrie what else was to fallow the covering in the ship with leaves to make it blend with it surroundings
come of flush was not the word the captain or any w else of his time y had understood
what can be said during that time sir cristo ask
i am somewhat skills in medicaments i have to be as a captain of ship and crew know it
i shall say that you are in my own cabins as that i can care for you
not since he had left mister looker and chris felt such confines as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
he knew now that his absence for his long as he had o to be away would be covered up and satisfaction inly accounted for to
their conversation had taken some little while
when church yards yon

a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and woman to whom no tad bound him save the presence of the same host

toward dark a man went into buy lamp
you found the place without alight it stumbled over something on the floor and there was all e's body with they head busted in in this heavy candle stick near it

what are the churns of getting him off legally if we go lighted from a negative standpoint asked the colonel
rather ey pathetic questioned colonel but i should say it might be a fifty fifty propositions
had best he would get off for the scotch verdict of not proving but he does w want that nor dole i

you don't mean that large struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did
the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no nos to him
air graft and statement was being unexpected greate confirmed
he remembered that cynthia and grafton had once been in lara with each other
she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer
because large made no defence
large by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
so i had to let her have a way and mesa last the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my council fe

but it was noticed that the older more conservative families for last off on represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smid not yet acquired any and were ring to take a chance
it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for mean the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be seen there cannot explained to the colonel

he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full a vexation injured aim proper as the pinch color lo of ow danny of which arca bol gr stroke in the full flush of his young belief in his important s a british officer had a pretty good stuck
and all' comes of dressing up in this stupid way like c rough fisher lad

for it suddenly curd to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless cit of people would stoppin nothing
no he thought to himself i don't believe there would kill me but they would not me about
the kick he had received was a four taste of what he might expecting after the little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter quickly as he could
to do this he must scheme lie he till morning that make for the nearest point signal for help ms bats crewe roar certain for him how to escape
but when know was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them m sly fitted into the stone so

sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hose were completely gone now and he said as teet fast and mentally called himself a weak ii at f ever thinking about such people

the doll sound of departing steps and low whistling sound coming down through the skylight windowed to the cabin or orgy r stroke way with his heavy lids pressed by sleep
what a queer dreamy sho to himself
but how queer for mister girard to be talking like that to anu teal the boy who hep to the cook
and why did any cob mister g father
there was interval of thinking over this nighty questioned during which the low whistling went on
and i'm l too tell i was up re suppose

nothing but the gene presented itself
a happy inspiration and come and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out at his little curved dirk glanced at the edge ran to the window and began to cut it one of the bars labour in vain
he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realised that the attemper madness
the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear selling sound as he founded now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working weil for twenty four hours she would not get through
but at the end deified minutes stopped and for us back the dirk into a sheath

captain murdo
but mars port had flourished enough to kill it off
some of mars laws dated from the time when lawn force ment had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
the stonewall gang numbered perhaps five hundreds
even dare lex and failures hadad to be there were stories and shops throughout the district which e out some kind of i marginal living
they were safe from protection rack tears there none boled to come so far out
the shop keepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earths
captain murdo was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
the pressure was enough to get them for him
cordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
i've got a free hand and were going to run this the way we would on earths
your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
the first man making a shake down will get the same treatment were going to use on the stone wall boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
he picked out five of the men including gordon you five will come with me
the rest of you can t up any way you want to night pick any rout that to open though came ms go
bruce gordon grins slowly as he swung the stick and murdoch's eyes fell on him earth co
two years gordon amin it
for a second gordon cursed himself
he began wondering about security then
nobody had tried to get and touch with him
there was a crewe lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim fs for ball glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
moving in two groups of threes that opposite sides of the street they began their beat
there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lack a air
gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands
gordon's eyes popped at that
he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
the other four cops had come in reluctantly
he brought him to the ground was a single blow crossed the kidneys
they rounded up the men of a gang and one of the cup started off
to find a f and call the wagon
were not using wagons mero tott him line them m
if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were club carefully
murdo indicated one who stood with his shoulder shaking and tears running down his cheeks
the captain's face was a sick as gordons felt
i want the name of everye man in the gang ye can remember he told the man
colonel they kill me i don't know
murdo took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tufts
if he said turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
trouble began brewing shortly after though
murdo sat one of the men to pick up a second squad of sixth and then a third
and the third one bu scorn and spotted one of the men had been beaten before
get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
but the captain stirred finally sighing
now the cops are giving me were covered gordon
but the stone while ganging backing wane
but us going to be tough on them
bis gordon grimmest i've got a yellow ticket from security
marduk blanked he dropped as his ey slowly
what makes you think wean will be re elected
nobody once him except again of crooks and those in power
ever se a martian election
no your firste he can't lose
and then helen is going to pop and this whole plant may be blown w open
it fitted with the dia predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair rest r around the corner
cost a more but they'd be respectable
because is he has always honest according to have he sees its
but you goot earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
the groups grew more experienced and murdo was trying a new squad every night
it wasn't exactly equal but nothing was here
this cate lead to ab abuses as he seen on earths
but there probably wouldn't be time for it if may wan was re elected
there was night outside and the poser bobs of the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct toast
it had probably been years since any had dared wist get after the sun went down
and the slowed doubtful respected on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that hay system was working
gordon h the signal switch and the mar speaker let out a shrill whistle
gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
you can't do it to me
i am reformed i'm going street
you dented cops can't oh nea was blubbering
one look was enough the work papers had the telltale over thickening of the signature they had showed up on other papers obviously forgeries
some turned away as gordon in the other cop went to work but most of them weren't squeamish
when it was over the two picked up their whimpering captive
chinks the other cop had been holding the wallet
must have been making a beg contact and something fifty fifty
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
when gordon and jenkins came back murdo tossed the money to them split it
whatever comes to hand governor
like this serial call a gorden asked him
a little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober note
you are me some bill's govern
eleven hundred fifty credits
you didn't pay up pledge to a captain fond so i had a fill
a thousand interest at ten p cent week standard right
gordon had heard of the friendly interest charge on side here but he shook his head wronging as he
hah as he turned it over and shook his head
now show me were i signed any agreement saying i'd pay you back
for ast second is he's face went blank then he chuckled
he poured out the bills and handed them over
thanks his e thanked yourself
the kid pocketed the money cheerfully noding
the little guy new mars as few others did apparently from all sides
and if any had the other cups had private rackets of their own is he was undoubtedly be man to find it out and us the information with a beat such as that even going halfs and with all the graft to the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
the captain look completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped into the bench
go on except de m it
there was a mean coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
the little publish was back at the crusader again
only gordon and shea were left
credit had been established again and the business were open
gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwellings built like the dome but opake the privacy
they had been lucky
show bird's volunteers were official now
fats place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
he reached automatically for the class of e you needle beer
thought you'd be in the chips
that's mars gord ack other's comment why don't you pull off the plant thats you could go back to earth i'd guess other nob
gess a man and gets hes to anything hell may be i can hires and bombs to sit around and moo it up when the ships come in and bi this as a real old martian dan of sin
there was a grin on the others space
finally got out orders for you it's mercury
we sent whing others a same way and they failed
let say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
you can't stay here
there's a rocket waiting to trans ship you to the men on the way to mercury right now gordon side
and and i paid her the pay were are you from the time he began us in your beads she's out shopping
but his old eyes were glinting
did you think we'd let you go without seeing off cover he asked
i i oh dad it i'm getting old as he you tell him
he grabbed gourds hand and waddled down the landing plank is he shook his head
