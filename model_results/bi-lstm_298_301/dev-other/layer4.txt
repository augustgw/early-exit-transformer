as i approached a city i heard bell's ringing and little later i found the streets a stir with throngs of well dressed people in family groups winding their way hither and thither
looking about me i saw gentleman in a neat black dress smiling and his hand extended to me with grey cordiality
he must of razed i was a stranger and wished she tendered his hospitality to me i accepted it gratefully i clasped his hands he pressed min
we gazed for a moments s lightly to each other's eyes
of course youre going there too i said to my friendly guide
yes he answered i cannot the worship i am a priest
an idle i whispered taken by surprise
they worship god they did not exists
but the greeks love their gods i protested my heart clamly in my breast
no i said in a low voice
he was an idle then and not a god
it made athens see of light it created the beautiful the true the good yes our religion was divine
it had only one fault in trop of my guide what was that
i inquired without knowing what his answer would be it was not true
produce him
i wis we to myself what blasphemy
then taking heart i told my guide how more than once i had felt apollo's radiant presence in my heart and hold him of the immortal lines of homer concerned the divine apollo
do you doubt homer
i said to him homer the inspired barred
no no apollo is not in ile
he is a god and a son of a god
the air was heavy with incense a number of men and gorgeous vestments were passing to and fro thou in it kneeling before the various lights and images
observing my anxiety to understand the mean of all this my guide took me aside and in a whisper tolde me that the peep were silbury and anniversary of the birth the ot their beautiful saviour jesus the son of god
forget apollo he said with his suggestion of severing his voice
there is no such person he was only an idle
if you would a search for apollo and all the u verse would never find e when answering to his name were description
i want to se he jesus i hasten turning towards him
will he not be here this morning
when he not speak to his worshippers i asked again
will he not permit them to touch him to caress his hand to class with divine feet to and held the embalm fragrance of his breath to bask in the golden light of his eyes to hear the musical of his immaculate accents
i asked my eyes feel with wonder in my voice quivering with excitement
would not that then i vent to ask impatiently make jesus as much of an idle as apollo
and it faith that jesus is a god pros a god wh will not faith in apollo make him le god
but i am determined not only to know if it is possible the whole truth about jesus but also to communicate that truth through others
but there is more of a moral tonic and the open and caned discussion of a subject like the one in hand th in the multitude of platitudes
i never deliver lecture in which i do not even directly or indirectly if full and free expression to my faith in everything that worthy of faith
if i dont not believe in dogma is because i believe in freedom
oh he tears down but he's not build up is another chris ism about my work it is not true

let us place our selves entirely in the hands of the evidence
as intelligent beans would desire to know where this jesus whose worship was not only costing the world millions of the people's money but which is also drawing to his service the time the energies the affections the devotions and the labour humanity is a myth or reality
a number of other dates were observed with a christian church of various times as the birthday of jesus the goss was give no date and appear to be quite uncertain really ignoring about it
yet there is no evidence that he was borne on that day
why this discrepancy in historical document you say nothing about inspirations
again matthew says that to escape the evil to signs of herod mary and josephs with the infant jesus flat into egypt loops h is nothing about this hurried flight nora herd's intention to kill the infant messiah
when we come to them more important chapters about jesus we meet with quitter difficulties

but in the at allens of evidence or in offers a following methane who arguments against pipt coal senses one
if we are to have any mythology at all he seems to argue why objected to adding to it the miss of jesus
the immediate companions of jesus appear to be on mother hand as mythical as he is himself
who was matthew who was mark
who were john pater judas and merry
there is actually no evidence that they ever existed
if peter ever went to rome with the new doctrine hows it that no historian has taken note of him
he again we see the presence of a myth
he was the only one who saw them
peter paul john james judas ill kept the stage almost exclusively
it is impossible to explain while the contemporaries of jesus the authors in the historians of his time do not take notice of him
c they have been a conspiracy against him
hows is his um sides be ac for
how then are we to decide which the a numerous cannes for divine honoured should be given our bootes
and such a faith is never free it is always maintain by the sword now and by hel far hereafter

moreover give just could keep his promise there would be to day no misery in the worlds no orphans no childless mothers no shipwrecks no floods no famines no disease no crippled children no insanity no wars no crime no wrong

how me self deluded profits these extravagant claims have produced
and who can number the bitter disappointments caused by such impossible promises
the same which a preachers of to day give he parried his aunts with many words and at length said that the promise was betaken with the provisions that what we asked for would be given have got fight it for our good
but he said if he ask anything in my name i will do it and if it were not so i would have told you

self effort and not prayer is a really against ignorance slavery poverty and lord degradation
it was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of in congruity when with impressible persons love becomes sol sisters ness hope sinks to misgiving and faith to hope when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at opportunities for ambitions that had been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise
still to a close observer they are just as perceptible the difference is that their media of manifestation are less trite and familiar than such well known ones as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf

no sooner with some semblance of order restore than some exceptionally heavy way would tear away the lashing and the work had be done all over again
from this moment about four a m the injun became the centre of interest
the water gain d spite of everye effort
the outlook a paid grim
the mount of water which was being made with the ships roughly handled was most uncertain
williams had to confess he was beaten and must draw eyes what was to be done
the build pumps depended on the main engine
on one occasion i was wast deep and standing on the rail of the poop
the after god were organized in two parties by evans to work buckets the men were kept steadily going on the choked hand pumps this seemed all that could be done for the moment and what imaged account as the soul safe got of the ship from sinking practically an attempt to biler out

the fun had taken this morning meal and now lay curled up on a bed of moss
when never the faun caught up he was quite contain to fisk about
the danger was certain now it was near
the hows had struck a trail where she turned and the fawn was safe
one was rolling the other had a gun in his hand what should she do
her tired legs couldn not propel the tant body rapidly
the go saw the boat nearing her
in a moment more the boat was on her and the man at the oars had leaned over and caught her
i was tormented by thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctor's orders
that old man seeded to give so much annoyance yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams
philly c given them orders not to speak to me of this
this made had stolen from me certain little things of some importance and in her fear of being defective she would have been veryain glad if i had died
accordingly she allowed me twice to take as much as i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask full i thin covert myself and began to sweat and fell into a deep sleep
they see that my poor friend was on the point of falling to the ground so grieved was he to hear this
afterwards he took an u g least state and began to beat the serving girl with all his mind shouting out ah treats you have killed him for me then
she may did have saved my life so led me a helping hand for i have sweated and be quick about it
flit recovered his spirits dyed and make me comfortable and ive been conscious of a great improvement in my state began to reckon on recovery
just then the other doctor bernardino put in his appearance who had beginning of my illness had refused to bleed me
my references coes that most able m exclaimed oh power of nature
she knows what she requires and the physicians know nothing
that simplon m ro bernardino made user say if he had drunken another bottle he would have been cured upon the spot
afterwards he turned to me and as if i could have drunk more water
i answered no because i had entirely pointed my thirst
in liked manner she was asking for what she wanted when the pool young m bad d to bleed him
if you knew that recovery dependent upon his drinking two flasks of water why did you not say soe before
you might then have boasted of his keel
at this words the wretched quiet sulkily departed and never showed his face again
the very evening i was taken with great precautions in a chair well wrapt up and protected from the cold
do not permitting any irregularities for though he h escaped this time another disorder now would be the deaths of him
that he turned to me and said my band vot be prudent come mea no excesses and when you are quite recovered i bag you to make me amadon with your own hand and i will always pay my devotes tor for your sake
so i made my mind up and prepared to travel
that day many friends came to see me among others pierre lady who was the best e dearest friend i ever had
next day there came a certain nicolai mona ago who was also a veryain great friend of mine
i had harbored him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house upside down for the m was subjects to a species of dry scab which he was always in the habit of scratching with his hands
meanwhile that able physician fr chest co d mona vari attended to m cure with great skill
there they sit me to wait until the duke went by
many of my friends at court came up to greet me and expressed surprise that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shuttered by illness they set that i ought to have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke
at this words miser augustino the duke's tailor mad his way through all those gentlemen and said it that's all you want to knows you shall know it at this veryain moment
george is a painter whom i have mentioned happened just then to pass and myra augustino exclaimed there is the man will accuse you now you know yourself if it be true or not
as fiercely as i could not being able to leave my feat i asked george if it was true that he had accused me
he denyed that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sword
my threw au astina retorted you gallows bird
don't you she know that i know it for most certain
georg made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me
then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted
the duke gazed at me and marvelled i was still life afterwards he d fe take heed to be an honestest man and regain my hells
when i reached home nicolo dah mona gut came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin written with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards take french leaf because my jap came from a quarter and a man who was able to destroy me
i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had injured me and tolde all the affair ab the mein
he repeated get hens as quickly as you can and be of goods courage for you will see of vengeance executed sooner then you expects
i the bestest attentions to my heals gave pier bagua advice about that thing the coins and they went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else
you want them to immoral that ferocious tyrant
you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you i will e inveterate foe and that devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mine to hang you without any fault of yours
it was firmly believed that duke alisandre was the sun of pope clem'
mister francesco used also to say and swear by all his saints that if he coulde he would have robbed me of the dyes for that meadow
i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should nevers see them more
i thou sent to florence to request lorn sinon that he would send me the reverse of the meadow
nicolo da mont tare grout to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher lurid sea not for it it he had replied he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better invent one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bringing it without hesitation to the duke for this would be to my advantage
i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate and pressed the world forward to my best ability
this being so as he was a fellow of much humour we used offered to laugh together about the great credit he had gain
i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling peas ready and at a veryain long range brought two of them down with a single ball
i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to hit my mark at two hundreds cubit which cannot be done by otherways of loading
i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we mak haste for rome
we have succeeded in amassing two hundreds ounces of silver enough i trust to erected a handsome bronze figure
to be surer it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priest is boasting about i could live it ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass purpose
but the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrade's thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of koona
here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in fairy boats that start soon as sum twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked
when the boatman a passengers heard the splash and saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made everye effort to save him but the wind was fair in the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundreds yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him
when he saw this the room feigned the utmost grief in dismay and said to his fellow passengers d this priest whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron and as i happened top business there as well we settled to travel together
now alas by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone
he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believes a story and pitied and tried to the comfort him
then the ran and said to the boatman
what thinks gentlemen added he turning to the og travellers
they of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to there onward journey and all with one voice agreed to what the run and had proposed and so the matter was settled
when at length they reached the shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the ran overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priest luggage and putting it with his own pursued his journey to kiyoto
fortune favouring his speculations he began to a mass great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself nothing and in the course of time he married a wife who bore him a childs
since then always gone well was me yet had i not been poor i had never turned to sassin north thief
he would have fled into the house but the ghost stretched forth its withered arms and clutching the back of his necks scalded at him with a vindictive glare and a hideous ghastliness of mean so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear
at length undone by such ceaseless vexation took a bay fell ill and kept muttering oh misery misery the wandering priest is coming to torture me
now it chance that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest who lodged in the next street
and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all over
three years ago had the coon a fairy you flung me into the water and well you remember it
happily continued the priest i had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so i reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded and setting up a bronze figure to buda thus fulfilling the wish of my heart
on my journey homewards i took a lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvelous ailment
thinking i could divine its cause i came to see you and am glad to find i was not mistaken
and would it not ill become me to bear malice
repent therefore in abandon your evil ways
to see you do so i should esteem the height of happiness
be of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that i am really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you
and a fit of madness i was tempted to kill and bobbio
fortune befriended me ever after but the richer i crew the more keenly i felt how wicked i had been and the more i foresaw that my victim's vengeance with some day overtake me
haunted by this thought i lost my nerve till one night i beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill
but how you manage to escape in her still alive is more than i can understand

grand papa said phronsie wasn't missus chatterton in it to charlotte

the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous fresh of a starry eyed flushed cheeked the young woman who demanded
where is he pat miss billy gasped the old man
aunt hanna's cheeks two were flushed and her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way pet had said miss billy's name
it was one matter for her to objected thing billy was doing but quite another for pat to do it of course it's she
retorted aunt hanno testily as if you yourself to't bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night pet where he

pete had recovered himself by now but he did not even glance toward aunt hannah
miss billy miss billy you're an angel straight from heaving you are you are oh i'm so glad you came

billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall aunt hanna's indignant voice arrested her billy's stopped
pet go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receiveth us pets lips twitched
but his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke
a flying figure brushed by him and fell on it sees by the couch with a low cry bertram's eyes flew open
donn lying found a there minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringing napkin that had been spread over bertram's tray
in the hall above aunt hanna was crying into william's gray when and duster that hung on the hall rack aunt hanna's handkerchief was on the floor back at hillside
then very ivery gradually it dawned over them that there was
as if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closer bertin was so thankful that it did have one arm that was usable
why of course stammered do i couldn't help thinking that maybee you had found out you didn't want me
demanded bertram angry and mystified
as from my not painting again you didn understand pete deary
she pulled herself half away from bertrams and circling arm
billy you a quivering sigh
good heavens is kate in this too bertram's voice with savage now
well she bon a letter
billy laughed gaily but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes
and you never did think for a minute billy that you cared for him
he had not been slow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids
billy was so glad bertram turned the questioned on her love instead of arkwright
after a minute billy stirred inside happily
you see i wasn't in love with mister ar cit
and and you didn't care especially for from miss win up
billy put a soft finger on his lips
bert kissed the finger and subsided h he c mined
well what is that is that kate too demanded bertram grimly
there was another silence then suddenly birch from stirred
billy i'm going to marry you to morrow he announced decisively
i don't know as i can trust you out of my sight till then you'll read something or here something or get a letter from kate after breakfast to morrow morning that will set you saving me again and i don't want to be saved that way
i'm going to marry you to morrow i'll get he stopped short with a sudden frown c found that law i forgot

if you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace ruf lings will do it afterwards not before but
besides i needed you to take care of me cut in bertram craftily
the tender glow on billy's face told its own story and bertram's eager eyes were not slow to read it
sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm
bailey my dare
it was aunt hanna's plaintive voice at the doorway a little later
we must go home and william iss hear too and wants to see you
you mean it' be before october
aunt hand a glance from one to the other uncertainly
yes nodded billy de merely
yes i know that is a good while cut in bertram
we wanted it to morrow but we had to wait un account of the new license law
yet so strong was the effected upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectations of the wood which should make him rich
apart of that impression was due to the engagement which he must now fulfill
to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes
because in his cellar days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many chance step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that roar attachment
unable to think of work he left the house and wandered gloomy about reach in's park
he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marian who was fats instrument
he wrote to mary him
will you let meed hear or come and seen
i scarcely thought of beth is likely to kill himself
but why the je did he go all the way out there
i hoped he would brad the sneers
poverty y i can only suppose
but i will see what dal i hadn't come across biffin for a long time
was he he still so merry poor
asked amy compassionately
i've afraid sigh his book failed utterly
oh if i had imagined him still in such distress surely i might have done something to help you
perchance his death was impart attributable to that hopeless love
he sent me a copy of his novel she said and i saw him once or twice after that
having this subjected converse upon put the two more quickly at ease then could otherwise have been the case
amy might take a foremost place a a bi women
especially now that her father is threatened with blindness
is it so serious
even if mister yule recovers his sight it is not at all likely that he will be able to work u before
ad difficulties are so grave that
he paused and led his hand failed despondently
i have a good deal of will you remember and what i have set my mind upon no doubt i shall some day achieve
there was sails
the last three years he continued have made no slight difference in my positions
recall where i stood when you first knee
just now i am in need of a little encouragement
you don't notice any falling of in my work recently
do you see my things in the current and so on generally
sometimes l believe i have detected you when there was no signature
her storing in that girl's paper h attracted attentions
and i could so easily put her of rest by renouncing all plain upon her
i surmise that that you yourself would also be put rest by such a decisions
join will at me with that ironical smile he pleaded
i couldn't go about declaring that i was heartbroken in any event i must be contempt for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgments are pretty sure to bey un favorable what can i do
the casas is two delicate by fear for my advice
well i'll g back to my script
again jasp held the white softe for a superfluous moment
yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry
marian could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companions smooth countenance
she had divined that there was some grave reason for this sons and the paining with which she approached was half caused by the anxious beaks of her heart
he began abruptly
he gave her such details he had obtained then added
there are two of my companions fallen in the battle
i ought to think myself a lucky fell i mary what
you would better fitted to fight your way jasper
more of a bat hevening
here no veryain well i dined
i have made up my mind about our affairs he went tom presently
yes
will you marry and let us take their chance
you feel yourself indispensable to your father at present
i should be so afraid of the effected upon his health jasper
she paused and looked up of him touchingly
dea i can't feel it would be my duty to renounce you because my father had become l
has one thing occurred to you
will he c con sent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is missus milby
and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him
she listened anxiously and reflected
as i have said there is a veryain serious doubt where the your father would accept money for you when you were my wife
it isn't your fault marian and well then there' only one thing to do
except jasper thy father is helpless by must fin means of assuring his support
dig you think them insurmountable
that is just for have decided is impossible mar you shall have the plain truth
i don't trust myself
but shall you fac them willingly
put up your r umbrella marian
what do i care for a drop of rain she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is at stake how am to understand you
everye word you speak seems intended to disheartened me
why needed you conceal it if that is the truth
is that what you mean by sign you distrust yourself
we muste each other again marian
how am i to eve an hour in such uncertainty is this
i do wish it
her emotion hadn an effected on him and his voice trembled
there is no natural war that a childs should surrender everything for her parents
you knows so much more of the wor that i did can't you advice me
this no way of providing for my father
goode god this is frightful marian i part standard
i will be faithful to you
he had made a pretense of holding his a bower ov her but mari and turned away and walked to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a great tree her face averted from him
moving to follower he saw that her frame was shaken by soundless sobbing
in what can they been more selfishness
but i couldn't save on word that would seem to invite such misery as this
you don't love me jasper at that an end of everything
happiness or misery come to us bit fight
is it in my power to make you happy
but if you had said you loved me before that i should have it always to remember
if i believe anything i believe that i did love you
what can you say to me more than you have said now
remember me as a man who disregarded priceless lu such as yours to go and make himself a proud position among fools are knaves indeed that one its come to
soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merit it my perverse pride would revolt against it
what can be simpler than the truth
it is a thing that happens everyday either in a man o woman and all would hon a demands is the courage to confess the truth
marian do you do this will you let her engagement last for another sixth months but without her meeting during that time
that seems to be childish
the rain fell unceasingly and with it begin to mingle an autumnal mist
just the delay a moment then asked calmly
are you going to the museum yes
go home again for this morning marian you carp work
i must and i have no time to lose
good bye she gave him her hand
they looked at each other for an instant then marian left the shelter of the train opened her umbrella and walked quickly away
jasper did not watch her he had the face of a man who is suffering a su via humiliation
his sister said veryain little for she recognized genuine suffering in his times and aspects
a few wings ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest affection but who is bury rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him
yesterday morning he received her final answer i refusal
you will understand they surely you needed no fresh proof how utterly unworthy he is of you
you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you
several days passed before there came a reply
i must only ask th you will were right to me without the least reference to these troubles tell mee always about yourself and be sure that you cannot tell me too much
we had then but little of that minute and accurate knowledge o of the interior of the covenant which was requisite for determinations of the problem
several diffrent parties were therefore organized to examine the various routs supposed to be practicable with in and northern and southern limits of the united states
the only discriminations made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern lime and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of executions of all the surveyes
he enquiries were made with regards to gunpowder which subsequently led to the use of a coarser rain for artillery
the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by se selection from those already in the service in the regular army and partly by a point from civil wife
under instructions from the presentment the lest was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution
after some further discussion of the questions the visors withdrew dissatisfied with the result of the interviews
a quarter master general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake and the appoint to the office had been confounded with his fathers who was a well known wig but that heat the sun was a democrat
i assured the general that this was altogether im material adding that it was a veryain pretty quarrel as it stooder and that i had no a desire to effects a settlement of it on any inferior issue
nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the foxhound a very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size
if you want to hun your airs on foot sixteen inches is quite pig enough almost to big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches is a useful hight or even nin keens
it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule as color it is so much a matter out individual taste
but puppies are usually sent out to walk and may easily be procured to he captain reared until they old enough to be hindered to their work
he has of course finer but with the length of necks so perfecting the bigger hound the little shoulders of the same pattern and the tip cot quarters and second flies
and when he is fairly on a line of course he stick to it as the saying he like a beagle
it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otterhound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of goods eighteen inches and an almost at dental contemporary that was called the essex beagle
that a great many of the true order were bread became veryain manifest as soon as the harrier and bega associations was formed and more particularly when a sections of the peterborough hound show was reserved for the

all things which followed from the absolute nature of any attribute of gods must always exists and be infinite or in other words are each herne and infinite through they said attribute
proof conceive if it me possible supposing the proposition to be denied that the something in sal attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of the said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of gods expressed in the attribute thoughts
in its nature infinite
must necessarily exist
we have now graded therefore thought not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of gods does not naturally follow from its nature can so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of god which is against our a oasis
and beyond the limits of the duration of the idea of god suppose in the latter at some time not to have existed for not to be going to exist thought would perforce have existed without the idea of god which is contrary to our hypothesis for we suppose that thought being given the idea of godness sar flowed their from
bearing mind that the same propositions may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from god's absolute nature
clary hes it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is is ins cols phraseology god is cause of the being of things as cy rim
corollary individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of gods poor modes by which the attributes of gods are expressed in a fixed and definite manner

yes i will try and then if id do well the little one shall have a merely christmas
but se then it is cold in the streets the wind bites in the snow freezes one fingers
she thanked to i and ran await to get ready for she felt sure her father would not these her anything
then she washed out little runs frock and put it to dry because she you would not be olds do at the next day
she longed to make the beds and dressed the children overnight she was in such a hurry to have all in order but as that could not be she sat down again and tried over all the songs she knew
when she had told her plan peter binary shook his head and thought i it never do but tessa baked so hard he consented at last that she should try it for from one a week and cent her to bet the happiest little girl in the york
as soon as her father was gone test flew about him put everything in nice order telling the children she was going out for the day and they were to mind toime was mother who would see about the fire in the dinner for the good woman left tessa and entered into her little plums with all her heart
poor tess's heart beat fast as she trudged away with tuo who slung his hart over his shoulder and gave her his hand
it was rather a dirty hand but so kind that tessa clun to it and kept looking up at the friendly brown face for encouragement

her hands were covered with child plains where she had no mittens but she had put them under her shawl and shuffled merrily away in her big boots feeling so glad with the week was over and nearly three dollars ta in her pocket
how gave the streets were that day
how bis g every one was and how bright the faces looked as people trotted about with big baskets holly wreaths and young ever greens going to blossom into splendid christmas trees
but i can't so ill fill the socks full and be happy said tessa as she looked wistfully into the gas stores and saw the heavy baskets go by
who knows what may ha been if we do well return tommo noding wisely for he had plan as well as tessa and kept chuckling over it as he changed through the might
well try one more street and then go home th att so tired little one
at the fourth some people let them singing all their songs and gave nothing
tessa felt so grateful that without waiting for ta she sang her sweetest little song all alone to
al last mama said rose and away she went into the dinning room close by
as the door opened test aisle what looked to her like a fairy feast all silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine and tall glass pitchers and smoking dishes that smelt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfactions
ah yes i shall come with much gladness and play never in my life before cried tama with a flourish of the old cap that made the children laughs

ah so kind so veryain kind i have no way to say thank you but runs i shall be for you a heavenly angel and i will singing my hart out for your tree cried cheater folding the mittens as if she would say your prayer of thankfulness if she knew how

that is why crime in punishment belongs to a lower range of fiction than any canina or fathers and sons
we sympathize indeed with the fears the bravado that d spare that succeeded the crime

mister marry bold dy faces the difficulty and attempts the definition
to him dos ask is work is the record of a great mind seeking for away of life it is more than a record of a struggle it is the struggle itself
and those voices takes shape in certain unforgetable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly mean tavern certain surrounding darkness

when he become excited on a certain points one could have sworn that one had seen him before see toed i bent in in police court awaiting trial or among vagabonds who passed their time begging before the prison doors
at all other times he carried that look of sad and gentle meekness seen on the images of old stoic saints
thus a portrait of the men one sees behinds asp novels the portrait when might almost have inferred from the nobles
it is a figure that at once fascinates and repels
he is not by temperament a singer
his musick is a still small voice unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and' storm
truth to tell mister hay is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet
he does not expressed life easily in beautiful words or an images
thus he writes in i found her at there of one who
there could not be an ugly and more pres could suguration this contained in the image in the last line
and pros injuries in the choice of words as well as in images
take for example these of the word domiciled in the passage in the same palm about

but what a sense of triumph there is in brownie's tragedies
his world is a place of opulence not a poverty
to have loved for an hours is with browning to live forever after in the inheritance of a mighty achievement
to have loved for an hour iss and mister hardy's imaginations to have deepened the sadness evened more than the beauty of one's memories
for then i u distressed by hearts growing called to me could lonely wait my embers rest with equanimity

the veal weeld to mister hardy is the world of ancient human things in which wore has come to be a hideous irrelevance
it may be thought on the other hand that mister hardy's ponds about war i no more expressive tragic futility than his ponds about love
futility and frustration are ever requiring seems in both
his lovers like his soldiers brought in the gray defeated of their glory

they had not much to say as they knew that they were ing for
and b by the sac re cul ourselves well
for whether state man would have been master over man
therefore in the state off innocence ban had no mastership of the animals
therefore in the state innocence before men had its bade nothing dispatch really subject to him
sign disapproved by the odor of divine providence which ho governs and fear things by this superi
certainly disproved from a probat men and bother animals
now what aver he's part as pated is subjected what is essential and even versa
therefore a subjection of other animals to man is prop to be natural
they would now hither on this c h been accepted from the mastership of men as neither at press nor day for that reason accept from the mastership of god his providence has mordan others
dig infant by the fact that god led at they most to men that he mon gave the names expressive that their respected natures
so all inst would have a bit men of their are own court as in the presence day some domestic ins obeah
objections one it was sing that ins sins man would not have had mass over all other creatures
much last therefore would he have a bit man in state of in messene
therefore seems it is by this reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems flinging the state ll sons men had not been in overpass
now a men reason has the positions of a master and not of a subjects
i answer that we must mass amid that in a primitive state there would have been some any quality at least as regards sex because generations the pins upon diversity of sex and likewise as regards a for some would have been borne of others nor would sex union have been serle
there might also have been bodily disparity
the clarity miles were rise on the parts of nature as bove described without any defects nature
objections one it will seem that inst of him sence man would not have been mc over men
therefore in the state of incense mow not have been subject a man
anthers sense mastership referred in a general sends to any conon of subjects and in this sense even ha has the office of governing and directing free men ca be cut a master
such a con of mastership would have existed in the sates between man and men for two reasons
but in the state thin sence they would have been lowed miscible age
on the contrary everything generated ins cresting perfects but in thees vis children would have been begot by generations
therefore from the first they would happen im perfects e ably size and power
therefore in the state of innocence there was no needed for women to be born on the contrary natures process en generations happy in commonly with manner in which it was established by god

it is no fault of mine god knows but it is not the less true that im not married and that the little garland who was playing out there with her doll as my childs
and you talk of my being your wife knowing that the child accepts me as her second fathers i said
it would be better and happier for us both if you hot as little pride as a childs pride she repeated
in such a position as mine
a helpless woman with the mock husband in prison for debt
a i to marry you for my fuit and shelter
the might to marry you because there' is no lawful tie that binds me to the father of my childs
that is he is he is not forsaken me he has been forced away
my only friend is it possible that you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife
the woman at my situation must be heartless indeed who could destroy your place in the estimation of the world in the regard of you friends
though wretchedest creature that walks the streets would shrink from treating you in that way
n what are men made of
how can you how can you speak of it
i yielded and spoke of it no more
every words she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom i'm had loved and lost
bitterly as i hated the man who had parted us and love her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake hopeless infatuation
i don't deny it i don't excuse it hopeless infatuation you have forgiven me i said
let me deserve to be forgiven
it is something to be your only friends
you must have plans for the future tell me unreservedly how i can help you
complete the good work that you h the gun she answered gratefully help me back the heal
make me strong enough to submit to a doctor's estimate of my chan living for some years yett
a doctor's estimate of your chances of living i repeated what do you you mean

why me d hesitate
you know that there is nothing i will not do to relieve your anxieties
never let me tell you the plain trough
there is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison
yes this is his position in two words a little while sence he obtained an excellent offer of employment abroad from a rich relatively of his and he had made all his arrangements to accept it

what was there to repent her from insuring her life if she pleased and from so disposing of the insurance as to give van brent and directed interest in her death
thinks to the happy accident of my position the one certain way a protecting her l easily within my reach
i could offer to lend the scoundrel the money that he wanted at an hour's notice and he was am to excep my proposal quite if easily as i could make it
you are quite mistaken i replied
i am only doubting whether they are plan for relieving mister van bran of his embarrassments is quite su simply as he suppose
are you aware as the delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to barrow money on the policy of insurance
i know nothing about it she said sadly
will you let me ask advice of my lawyers
they are trust where the unexperienced men and i'm sure they can be of use to you
cautiously as i had expressed myself her delicacy took the alarmed
promise that you won't ask me to borrow money of you for mister van branch she rejoined and i will accept to help gratefully
i could honestly thomas that
my one chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge to corse that i had now determined to pursue
i rose to go while my resolutions still sustained me
kissed mee she whispered before you g
it is only a goodness that overpowers me

and again when the artists following malicorne advice with a little late in arriving and when saint agnan had been obliged to be absent for sent time it was interesting to observe to though no one witnessed them those moments of silence full of deep expressions which united in one side to souls most disposed to understand each other and who by no means objected to the quite meditation they enjoyed to get
in a word malicorne philosopher that he was though heat knew it not had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in a midst of play and with desire in the assurance of possession
in this manner therefore without leading her room and having no confident she was able to returned who her apartment thus removing by her apparent a little tardy perhaps the suspicions of the most determined sceptic
but the door remain clothes and neither sight agnan thor the painter peered nor did the hangs e you
go dearest love said the king the te turn quickly
no no not today sir
i knew but too well that you had not ceased to love me
the valley with a gesture partly of extreme terror and partly as if invoking a blessing attempted to speak but couldn articulate one word
at the moment however when the king threw himself on his knees a cry of utter despair ranks through the quid accompanied by the sound of retreating footsteps
the captain sitting buried in his leather armchair his spurs fixed in the floor his sword between his legs was reading a number of letters as he twist his mustache
d'artagnan uttered a welcome full of pleasure when he perceived his friends son
ill my boy he said by what lucky incident does it happened that the king has i called june
these words did not sound agreeably in the young man's ears who as he seated himself replying upon th word i cannot tell you all that i know is i have come back hum
that the king has not recalled you and you have returned
i didn not understand that that dod
rowl was already pale enough and he now began to turn his hat round and round in his hand
what they do say the matters that you look as you do and what makes you so dumb
said the captain to people nowadays the sole met sor of airs in england
i have been in england and came here again as lively as a chaffinch

i am not pretending to be astonished my friend
i have neither head nor arms do not despise but help mee in two words i the most wretched of living beings o
she is deceiving ill said d'artagnan dot a muscle of whose face had moved those are big words who makes use of them
everyone ah
if everyone says so there must be some truth in it
not for a friend for a son
i dos take it you are really ill from curiosity
n it is not from curiosity is is from love
cut another big word
i tell you i love louise to distraction
well suppose it were only that
no sensible man ever succeeded in making much of a brain wind the head was turned
i have completely lost my senses in the same way a hundred times in my life
you would hear but you would not understand me you would understand but you would not obey me
o try tie
i go far evening if i were unfortunate enough to know something and foolish enough to communicate it to you you are my friend you say indeed yes
very avery good i should karl with you
i never complaining as you know but as heaven in my father would never forgive me for blowing out my brain i will go and get the first person i meet to give me the information which you with h i will tell him he lies and and you ocular

but the painter then deport
wh yous to home only that name in your mouth
i did not suppose it will concern him
yes your right and he made a step or two as if he were going to le wh are you going
to l for summon who attend me the troop
who was lat a woman
you wish to be consoled by some one and you will be so at once she will tell you nothing in if herself of course so be off
you are mistaken monsieur replied roule though man i mean will telling me all the evil she possibly can
well i admit it
and in point the fact why should i play with you as a cat does with the poor mouth
you distress me you do indeed
wit if you can
i could not so much the worse

how very fortunate that is he was looking for you too
she said the same tone of voice it is not i who am going to speak to him oh then
