that he turned to mea and sac my band thet be prudent comb no a excesses and when you are quite recovered i vague to make me of made with your own hang and i will always pay my devotions to wa fort you'll sake
so i mede my mind up and prepared to travel
that day many friends came to see mee among others pierre lady who was the best and dearest friend i ever had
mixt day there came a certain nicolo debt ago who was also a veryain great friend of mine
i had harbour him in rome and provided for his cost while he had turned my whole house up site down for the main was subjected to species of dry ga which he was always in the habit of s correcting with his hand
meanwhile that able physician francs goed the mon vi ky attended to my c with great skill
there they sided me to wait until the duke went by
many of my friends at court came up to greet me and expressed surprised that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shute by illness the set that i ought to have waited till li was well and then to have visited the duke
at this words mistrust din the duke's ta mayas way through all those gentleman and said it that all you want to know you shall knower at veryain moment
george was a painter whom i have mentioned happen jes then to pass and my sor was exclaimed there is the man who accuse you now you know yoursel it be true or not
as fly as i could not being able to leave my feet i asked george if it was true that he had accused me
he denied that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sword
mysa steal retorted you gallows bird
don't you know that i know it for most certain
george made off as quickly as as he could repeating that he had not accused me
then after a short while the duke came by wherefor i had myself raised up before his excellency and he haled
the duke gazed at me and marvelled i was deal alive afterwards ev me take heed to be an honest man and re gave my hes
when i reached home nicolo the male gut came to visit me and told me that i had excited one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had heed my ruin reed with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards take french lef because my depity ca from a quarter and a man who was able to destroy me
i answered that i had d nothing to displease but that he had endured me and to him all the affair about the mein
he repeated get hands is quickly as you can and be of goody courage for you will see of edges executed sooner than you expects
a the best attention to my helth gave pier o bargo advice about that thing the coins and there went off upon my way to room without singing a word to the duke for anybody ells
you want them to mortal liz that for roc's tyrant
you had never made anything sol exquisite which proves you i inveterate fo and then devoted friend and yet the pope and he have ha had it twice i mine to hang you without any fat of the yours
it was firmly believed that duke alessandro was the sun of pope cleaving
mister fr casal used also to say and swear by all saints that if he could he would have robed me of the dyes for that meadow
i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more
i thou sent to florins to request blur seein all that he would sand me the reverse of the meadow
nk lode male gr to whom i had receded wo back saying that he had spoken to that mad marland coyly philosopher lord se not foray he had replied he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better invent one out of my own head when i had finished it i might bring it without hesitations to the duke for this would be to my advantage
i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate and pressed the word forward to my best ability
this being sou as he was a fellow of much humour we used offered to laugh together about the great credit he had gain
i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling peas ready and at a veryain long range brought too of them down with a single ball
i never used to shot with more than one ball and was usually able to heat my mark at two hundred cubits which cannot be done by other ways of loading
i lifted at my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we m haste for room
we have had succeeded in a massing two hundreds ounces of silver enough i tress to erect a handsome brown figure
to be surer it seems a shame yet i could steal the money this pris as boasting about i could live it at ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about help best he might compass purpose
