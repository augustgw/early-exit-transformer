gods as a directed consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonored bosom to connected her parent f ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a bless soul in heavens
yet these thoughts affected hester prim less with hope than apprehensions
the child had a native grace which does not invariably co exist with fat less beauty it's attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were a very garb that precisely became it bestest
this outward mobility indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inter life
hester could only account for the child's characters and even then most magi e imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that moment dis period while pearl was imbibing her soul for from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earths
they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's dispositions but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolifick of the storm and whirlwind
hester print nevertheless the loving mother' of this one child ran little risk of airing on the side of undo severity
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge

beholding it heer was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little alp in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much r from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl splashing bloode and not utterly delusive
brooding over all these matters the mother' felt like one who has bo the spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjurations has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
pearl was a born outcast of the infantile worlds

another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek and interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
at that ef of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter publick interests and a far less intrinsic whit than the welfare of hester her child were strangely mixed up with a deliberations of legislators and axe of state

there were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mister black stone the first settler of the peninsula that half mythological persona who rides though our early annals seeded on the back of a bull

his hat had a peaked crowned a flat brim and around the brim was a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved
instead of shoes the old man wore boots with turn over tops and his blue coat had wye cuffs of gold braid
for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of owes in which they lived
when they were outside o simply latch the door and started up the path
no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so so far into the thick forest while they were gone
at the foot of the mountain separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the gilaks the path divided
he knew it would take them too the house of the crooked at magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbour
all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unkle ojo sat on the fallen tre trunk and at the last of the bread which the old munchkin had pled in his pocket
then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of doctor pied

yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose
a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and colors of claw who neatly so together
sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up
when i founded it i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colours would disco her from tying to be dignified as the blue munchkins
at the emerald city where our princess os m lives green is the popular colour
i will show you what a good job i did and she went to it tall covered and threw open the doors
o je examined this curious contrivance with wonder
maraud had first made the girls formed fromage quilted and then she had dressed it with a patch works skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same game material throughout out
the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her
the hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat braids
gold is the most common medal in the land of os and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable
no i forgotten about the brains exclaimed the woman
well that may bee true agreed margare loot but on the contrary a servant with too much brains as sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work
shep poured into the dish quantity from each of these bottles
i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in a servant
she ran to her husband side at once and helped him lift the four cads from the fire
their contents had all boiled away leaving in the bottom of each cattle a few grains of fine white powder
very carefully the magian removed this powder placing it altogether in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon
no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
ojo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
he selected a small gold bottle with the pepper box top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any objects through the small holes
most people talk too much so its a relief to find one who talks too little

but the beare instead of obeying maintained of the seated had taken and growled
the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hand he received they must stand further off
then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his positions and slowly entered the place
it was silent and gloomy being ten sole by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bounded both hands and feet by stronger and painful wits
the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and the singers as good as nothing
the delawares are children of the tots in they outstrip the dear
uncas who had already approached the door and readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
but hock ey who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himselfe into his companions
so incas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust cunning for want of speeded
well what can't be done by main encourage in war must be done by circumventions
as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions
my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy in love returned david a little n ho that so directs and attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord evening in the greatest straits
if you are were not then knocked on the head your being annon compass will protective and you'll then have a good reason tod expect to dieing in your bed
su chuse for yourself to make a rush or tarry here
bravely and generously as he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in hiss service
kep silent as longest may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
if however they take scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
holds said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for conditions he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practice myself as one without across a blooded though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
god bless you friend i do believe your sent has not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural of gifts in the force of temptations
the delaware dogs he said leaning forward and peering through the dim like to catch the expressions of the others features is he afraid
with the hers here his groans
the mo he can started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counter fitted was about to make some desperate effort
he had no occasion to delay fren next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
uncas cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would served to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitations that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
without his scrapbooks his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an inciter o man
i had to re it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correction
i was absent rather more than an hour
the only duplicate which existed so or far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion
the moment i looked at my tablet i was aware that someone had raged among my papers
the proof was in three longed slips i had left them al together
the etna was that someone passing observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
i gave him a little brandy left him collapsed in a char will im meade a most carefully ses of the room
a broken tip of lad was lying there also
not only this but on the tablet i found a small ball of black dull or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it
above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
to the best of my beliefs they were rolled out up
did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
i was in such a hurry to come toy you you left you door open
so it seems to me
now misters at your expose
above her three students one each story
then he approached it and standing on tipt with his n crain he looked into the room
there is no opening except the one paining said our learned guide
i am afraid there are no signs here said he
one could hardly hope for any upon so dry day
you left him in a chair you say which chair by the windowed there
the man entered and took the papers shed by she from the central
as a matter of fact he could not said palms for i entered by the side door
along with a taken to do that using every possible contraction the quarter an hour not less
then he tossed down and seized the next
he was in the midst of that when your returned caused him to make a very hurried retreat veryain hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been
mister salmons was someone overwhelmed by this flood of informations
comes held out a smalls chip with the letters and then and the space of clear wood
watson i have always done you an injustice there are others
i was hoping that if the paper i which he wrote was thin some traced it might come through upon this polished surface n i see nothing
as hommes tor the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and in larn of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
hm turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor hallo it is this
homes out on his open palm in the glare of the elector light
what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
i understanding to say that there are three studs to use this stair and are the habit of passing your door yes there are
and they are all in for examinations yes
one hotly likes to throw suspicions whet there are no proofs
let us the suspicions i will look after the proofs
my scholar has been left a very revery poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
the top floor belongs to mesa c learn
i donn not go su so far as that but of the three he has perhaps the least unlikely
he was still suffering from from the sudden disturbance of the quiet retain of his life
by have occasionally don the same thing at other times
did you look at these papers on the tablet
how cameo to leave the key in the door
anyone the room could get out yes sir
i really don't think heee much aboute at mister homes
only f for a minute or so
oh i wouldn not venture to say sir
you haven't seen any of them no sir
it was the indian whose dark sweet appeared suddenly upon his blind
he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
the set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
no name's please said homes as we not g christo
of course he didn not realize that it was ey who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances r suspicious
that is veryain importance at homes
you don't seem to realize the positions
t morrow was the examinations
i cannot be allow the examinations to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situations must be faced
it is possible that i may be in a position then too indicate some course actions
i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings goodby
when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
the fou mouse fellow at the top
hes the one with the worst record
why banister the servant whats his game in the matter
he impressed me as being a perfectly honest men
my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders and half humorous resignations
no goods my dear watson
i think so you have former conclusion
yes my dear watson i have so the mystery
look at that he held ab out his hand
on the palm three little pyramids of black do clay
and one more this morning
in a few hours the examinations would commence and he was still in the delaid between making the facts public and allowing the culprit for the valuable scholarship
he could hardly stand stills so great was his mental agitations and he ran towards holes with two eager hands outstretched think heaven that you have come
you know him i think so
if this matter is not to become publick we must give ourself certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial
no sir certainly not
there no mans sir
his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon bannister in the farther corner
just close the door said homes
we want to know mister gil christ how you and honorable man ever came to commit such an actions that of yesterday'
far a moment gil christ with upraised hands tried to control his riving features
c come come said said homes kindly it is human to air and at least no one can accuse you being a cals criminal
well well don't trouble to answer listen and see that id do you know injustice
he could examine the papers in his ow office
the indian i also thought nothing of
when i approached your room i examined the windows
no one less than that would have a chance
i entered and i took you into my confidence to this suggestions of the side tablet
he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are weare with several sharp spikes
no harm would have been done had it not been that he passed your door he perceived the key which hadn been left by the carelessness of your servant
a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
he put his shoes on the tablet
gloves said the young man
suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
h i told the truth mister go christ
i have a letter here mister sols which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night
it would be clear to you from what i have said that only you couldn have let this young man out since she were left in the room and must have locked the door when you w out
it was simple enough sir if you only had known but without your cleverness it was impossible you couldn know
if misters soul saw then them the game was up
in the debate between the signor societies her defense of the fifteenth amendment had been n only notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
the south she had not thought of seriously in yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not a verse to charleston or newland's
john tao who had supported her through college was interested in cotton
better gol he had council sententiously
might learned something useful down there
but johns no society just elementary work
then looking up tom's county
some curs wells there b plantations radiated two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
some others too big cotton county
you ought to know john if i teach negros ell scarcely see much of people in my own glass
at any rate i say go
here she was teaching dirty childrens and a smell of confused orders and bodily perspiration was to her times unbearable
she wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great props in reforms
so for the hundred time she was thinking too day as she walked alone up the laying back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms
coon shee boasted
she had almost forgotten that it was here within touch in sight
the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her searching away to the northward
it m be a bit of port here and there but most of place with such desperate pros
her regards shifted to the green stocks and leaves again and she started to move away
cotton is a wonderful thing is it not voice she said rather primly
miss taylor did that know much aboute cotton but at least one more remarked seem called four
don't know will of all things in would re commented miss tailor let ary born and cotton and o well as much as to asks the use she turned again to go
i suppose go its too early for them then came the explosion
good was don't grow on the tops vans but on the ground on the rots cams is that so
the golden fleece it's the silver fleas hearkened
sim you ter please won't you
now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even that she had been talking just talking they were no persons in the conversations just things one thing cotton
the honourable child smith missa's brother was walking swiftly up town for from mister easter le's wall street office and his face was pale
at last the cotton combine was to all appearances in assured facts and he was slated fort the sin it
why should he not be as other men
she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to herr like intelligence in others
as she awaited her guess she serve the tablet with both satisfactions and is quietude for her social functions were few tonight there were she check them of on her fingers sir james cried the rich english manufacturer and lady cit and mister missus banda pool mister harry cress well in hiss sister john tailor and his his sister and mister charles smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be you d dis senator from new jersey a selection of guests had been determine unknowns to the hostess by the meeting often interest earlier in the day
missus grey had met suns before but not intimately and she always had in mind vividly their cruelty to poor negros a subject she made a point of introducing fork with
she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister cress wille express himself so cordially as a proving of negro educational
do believe in soom educational ass mary tailor
i believe in the train in of people to the has capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
but caswell added significantly capacity differs in no mos l between races
the bandon pools were sure this and the englishman instant singing india became quite eloquent missus grey was mystify but hardly dared amid it the general trend of the conversations seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharper scrutiny before being loud much educational and as forth the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
positive the heroic added cress well avoiding hiss sister's eyes
but wher exactly we go
mary tao however related the tale of absorb to missus grace private ear later
fortunately said mister v ful nor banns in sobs all roving at ben a mutual understanding on most of these matters
he knew the silver flees passers must be ruined
it was the first great sorrow his life it was not so much the loss of the carton itself but the fantasy the hopes the dreams built rounded
ah the swamp the cools swam
the revelations of his love lighted and brightened slowly to it fled like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder
he panted to know ifs she too new or new and cared not or cared and knew not
she was so strange and human creature
the world was water veiled in mists
then of a sudden a midday the sun shot out hot and stills no berth of air stirred the sky was like lu steel of the earth steam
where was the use of imagining
the lug had been level with a des awe ago and now
perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
he started at a thought he hurried forth sadly
he splashed to step long farther and farther onward until he near the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
then he looked down the lagoon was dry
he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of all of green they tall wet and willowy
the squares of cotton sharp edged cavy were just about to verse to bowls
for one longed moment he passed stupid a gate with utter amazement then l dis against the tree
he gazed about re flexed astonished
here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite working pains someone had dug can now from the l leg to the creek into which the former had drained by longing and cook it way thus allow it to empty directly
he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost so
the years of the days of her ding were ten
the hope and dream of harvest was upon the lands
up in the sick rooms ora lay on the little white bed
the ned and we ab endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that stroll for her life with nold and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she open hera eyes and questioned
for while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at son and bird and tree
she rose with the fleeting glance gathered the shawl rounder then gliding forwards wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
she had been born within its porters within his boor she had lived and groan and within its border shed met her love
on she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island lo the cotton lay before her
the cha was empty when he knew
he darted through the trees and pasted a tall man strongly but slimily made
it is a very revery fin old place of redd brick softened by appeal powdery liken which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity swans to bringing the redd brick into terms of friendly con companionship with the lin stone ornaments surrounding the three gables the windows and the door place
but the windows are patched with wooden pains and the door i think is like the gate it is never opened
f for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shedding with a sonorous bang behinde the liber lackey who had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pare
a large open fire place with rusty dogs in it and a barer boarded floor at the far end fleeces of w stacked up in the middle of the floor some empty corned bags
and what through the left hand windows
several close horses a pillion a spinning wheel and an old box white open and stuff full of coloured rights
at the edge of the box their lies a great wooden all which so bars mutations concerned bears a stronger resemblance to the finest greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
the history of the house is plain now
but there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant afternoon he is pouring down his beams in makings sparkles amongst the wet straw and lighting up everye patch of vivid green moss and the red tiles of the couched and turning even the moy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for yellow build ducks who are seizing the opportunity of getting a drink with his much body in it is possible
were the great barn doors are thrown white open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendents of mister goby the widow otherwise saddler who entertains them with a latest treadles and gossip
hey sor often took the opportunity when her an back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflections of herself in those polished services for the oak tablet was usually turned up like a screen and was more for ornament than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round puer dishes there weren on the shelves above the longed deal diner table's of the great which always shown like jasper
do not suppose however that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance she was a goodlooking woman not more than eight in thirty a fair complexions and sandy here well shapen lightfooted
the vainly like between her and her knees din mores with a contrasts between her keenness and dinas serf gentleness of expressions might have served a painter as an excellent suggestions for a martha and mary
her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a dam sol came with ar shot seemed to take up an unfinished lure as a barrel organ take sub tune precisely at the point where it had left off
the fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the wows and why consequently missus poyser should scold molly the housemaid with unusual severity
towel appearance molly had got through her afterpart manner had cleaned herself with great despatch and now came to ask submissively if she should sit down to her spinning till milking time
spinning indeedy
i never knew your equals for galls ness
who t you describe floor i should like to now
come the wall for the wows indeedy
that's which you'd like to be dinging is it

she's going to put the earning things away
money i did like to do into the barn to tim me to see the wad
no no no ty had gid her feet wet said missus poyser carrying away her iron
did ever anybody sea like screamed missus poyser running towards the tablet when her ey had fallen on the blue stream
puy however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the deary with a sort of wadding run and in amount of fat on the neap of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pigg
and she was rey found of view two an rachel
i often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way
which he had that ban illness and i was only eleven years old she used to say you'll have a friend on earth in your aunt rachel if i'm taken for from you for she has a kinds heart and i'm sure i've found it so

by this time the two gentleman had reached the pilings and had got down from their horses it was plainly meant to come in
said mister irwine with his stately cordiality

oh sir said missus poyser rather alarmed he wouldn't like it at all
but you more about that that i doe sir
i think i they should be doing you a service to turn you out of such place
i knows farm is in better order than any other with ten miles of us and as for the kitchen he added smiling i don't believe theres one in the kingdom to beat it

this missus poyser said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in arme pans and would adjust his opinions of her to the appearance of herder
oh i've no doubts and capital order

the london plant was less temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings and the vicinity of holborn va
there mess y's johnson in hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told
the dial electric machine tho small was robust four under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen nighty nine seventeen years
owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers edison has been frequently spoken of as an upon it of the alternating current
why if we erect stationed the falls it is a great economy to gether up to the city
there' seems no good reasoned f for believing that it will change
brad as the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them he is idiot scrattel oppose to lon wasteful methods to plans of empire that neglect the poor the gate
everything he is done has been aim that the conservation ration of energy the contractions of space the intensification of culture
for some years it was not found feasible too operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously
it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could it charge storage batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the d occur
but when it came to be questioned of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts amon country residence or a far mouse the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and his ideal
edison was in intolerant of sham and shod and nothing would satisfy him that couldn not stand cross examinations by microscope test tube and galvanometer
unless he could secure an engine of smother running and more exactly governed regulated than those eva be foras dio and lamp edison realize that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light
mister edison was a leader far ahead of the time
he obtained the desired speeded and load with a friction break also regulator of speeded but waited four an indicator to verified
then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running and mister edison inform me that as amen engine started before the ship lef the york and continued running until it reached its home port so and engine forth his purposes must produced light at all times
allison had install his his stork first great central stations system new york on the multi ark system covered by his feet and maine invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against the straight too wire system threw out of the tree kinds
he soon fore saw that still greater economy would be necessary f for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact district of large cities
the strong positions held by the edison system under the strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and he gave an immediate epic this of lighting
it was specially suited for a trial plat also in the early days when yield six or eight lamps to the horse bower was consider subject for congratulations
the street conductors were of the overhead pull line constructions and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by avis builded and equip central stations
meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three w system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent invents at practically the same time
i think he was perhaps more appreciative that i was of the discipline of the edison construction depart and fun it would be well for us to wait until the morning the fourth before we started up
but the plant ran and it was the first three wire stationed in this country
they were later used as reserved machines and finally with the engine retired for from service as part of the collections of ad sonia but they remained in practically as goods conditions as one installed in eighteen eighty th
the arc lamp in stalled outside a customer's premises or in a circuit fore public street lighting burned so many hours knightly so many knights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate four hours when the lamp might be out through accident
ein held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a mete
there was infinite skepticism a rounded him on the subjects and while other invents were also giving the subject ver thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that couldn not be seen or wee and only gave secondary evidence if of itself at the exact pointed use could not be brought to accurate registration
hence the edison electric neet is no monger used despite its excellent qualities
the principle employed in the edison electric met is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance
associated with the simple former of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operations freedom from in accuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
the standard edison meter practice was to remove the cals once a month to the meter room of the central stationed company for examinations another sat beings substituted
in december eighteen eighty eight mister dub je jenks read interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers al theo six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use then any others
the others having been an operations too short at timed to showed definite results although they also went quickly to a div and basis
in this connections it should be mentioned that the associations of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison metre was a and that its use was not expensive fore stations above one thousand lights and that the best fatal results were invariably secured in a stations se current by meter
the meter continued in generals service during eighteen ninety mind and probably up to the clothes of the century
he weighed and rew the meter plates and pursued every line of investigations imaginable but all in vain
he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
the problem was sorted
wee were more interested in the technical conditions of the stations that in the commercial part
we had ms in which there were two bottles of liquid
here she would stay comforted soothe among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turn of the gardener whose sense polly's first rapturous entrance had taken her into his goode graces for all time
every chance she could steal after practis hours were over and after the clamorous a mans of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
then dear said missus whitney youll must be kindly to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
somehow of all the days when the home feeling with the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear at no longer
ifs she gould only see phronsie for just one moment
oh she's always at the piano said man she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
at this the bundle opened suddenly and out pop phronsie
but polly couldn't speak and have jasper hadn't caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool phronsie and all

i know gasped polly controlling her sobs i won't only i can't thanks you
asked pansy in intense interests slipping down out of polly's arms and crowding up close to jasper side
yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truely pansy
all no chapter i just go by my veryain own self
there jap you've cot it laughed percy while the others screamed the side of jasper's face
don't mind it polly whispered jasper pent her fall
dear me ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost amazement and such a time as i've had to get her here two
hued her mother' ever let her go
she asked impulsively i didn't believe you could persuade her fathers
i didn't ha any fear as if i worked rightly said the old gentleman complacently
he cried and high dagon just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose that them all soot his fancy
and the old gentlemen was was so delighted with hiss success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time
at last he came out of them and wife his face vigorously
it sixteen years since john berks and died
his wife now lies beside him and the whit shau that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields
from from the nor regin graveyard one looks out over a vast check bard marked off in squares of wheat and corn li and dark dark and light
from from the graveyard gate one can count that does gaily painted farmhouses the yielded weather veins on the big red barns week at each others across the green and brown and yellow fields
but air and the earth th curiously mated and intermingled as if the one r the breath of the others
he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy grey eyes deeply set under a serious brow
that's not much of a job for an ale here i've been a town and back
axe that you sleep late
she gathered up her reins
please wait for me mary aie coax
i never see lose sighed over here
how brown you've got sence you came home i wish i had an adele to nom my orchard
i get wet to my knees when i goed down to pick cherries
indeedy he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it
they think your proud because you've been away to school are something
there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail
on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall o sage oran sheds their glossy green mocking off the yellow fields
any one there about would have told you that this was one of her richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra bergs and
there is even a white ra be hips and the orchard under the wall trees

a b brisk win had come up and was driving puppy white clouds across the sky
the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
that invitations decided her

i suppose thats though season too them
it exciting to se everything growing so fast and to get the grass cut

that wont last it will go away and thing will be just as they used too
i pray fort you but that's not the same as if you prayed yourself
i can't pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i won pray not to have them not if i'm damped for it
then all our good times are over
curdy august fifteenth the sea and broken all round no land in sight
the horizon seems extremely distant
all my danger and sufferings or needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am well his nature has resumed its sway
youse seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye anxious
one might be would less reason the now
i am not complaining the rid a slow but that the seat is so wide
we are res time and the fact is i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a up hor raft
he called the sea upon and i longed for wa ticking a little sail
therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects
i take this is my answer and i leave the professor tobit his lips with impatience
sunday august sixteen
nothing knew whether unchanged the wind fresh ands
but there' seene no reason of fear
the shadow of the wat was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
truely the sea is of infinite w
it must be as wide as the mediterranean for they lang and why n
these thoughts agitated me all day in my imaginations scarcely calm down after several hour sleeve
i shudder as i recalled these monsters to my remembrance
i saw at the hammer museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in lake
i suppose professor leading brock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pig his eyes traverse the ocean from side de side
tuesday august eighteenth
daring his watch i slept
two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me
the raft was heeded up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of tway fathoms
there's awa awa cried the professor
fight was out of the questioned now the rep tals rose th willed around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of expressed trains
two master's emly re creating all this commotion and be form my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive worlds
i can distinguish the eye of it the as sor glowing like a red hot cole and as large as a man's head
it's jaw is enormous and according naturalist it is arm with no less than pin hundred and eighty two teeth
those huge creatures attacked each other with a greatest animosity
suddenly the assist and the places source disappear below leaving wh pul ing in the water

the roarings become lost in the distance
the weather if we may use the term will change before law
the atmosphere is charged with vapors pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of sailing waters
the electric light can scarcely penetrate to the dance curtain which is dropped over the theater on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged
the air is heavy the sea is calm
from time time a fleecy tuft of miss we yet some gleaming light left upon it drops down upon the dense fl of grey and loses itself in the opake and impenetrable mass
the atmosphere as evidently charged and surcharged with lecture city
the when never lows but to acquire increased strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge res a fearful windy gusts and rushing storms
theres a heavy storm coming on i ceded pointing towards the horizon
those clouds seem as if they were are going to cush the se
on the ms already i see the light play of lament saint ev fire the out sturt silled catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lad
but if we have now ceased to advance while do weet leave that sa loose which at the first shock of a tempest m caps us in a moment
that will be the safest no no never

the raft bears on stilled to the south east
at noon the valance of the stormy doubles
each of us is lashed to some part of the raft
the waves rise above our heads
they seem to be we are lost but i'm not sure
he nods his consent
the farre ball half of it wye halfs blue and the size and mt in shill moved sole about the raft but revolving on its own axis with astonishing phil city as if whip round by the force of the whirlwind
here comes there it glides now is up the ragged stump of the mast thats it lightly leaps on the provisions bac descends with the light bound and just skim the powder magsy horrible
we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches harms who fixes his blue eye upon it steadily it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees but his head down to avoided

poor alice
it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed the pair white kid gloves in one ha and a large fan in the other he came trotting along and a great hurry meting to himselfe he came oh the duchess the duchess
oh what she be savage if i've kept her waiting
alice tok up the fan and gloves and as the hall was veryain hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is today
and yesterday thinks w on just usual
i wonder i've been changed in the night
i almost i can remember feeling a little different
i'll try if im know all the things i used too
i shall never g to twenty it that rate
how cheerfully he seems to grand how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws
no i'd made up my mind aboute it if i'm mab i'll stay down here
itll be no use there putting their heads down and san come up again dere
i'm so veryain tired being all alone here
and i declare it's too pad that it is
i wish i hadn cried so much said alice as she swim about trying to find her way out
i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned my own tears
that will be a queer thing to be sure
i am very revery tired to swimming about here o mouse
cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
we won't talk about her any more if he'd rather no we indeedy
we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
the conditions that ill will be permitted to make lo her talk american stream wh him so to speak because you will never get people whether in outside the luther in church actually to read luther and must we make him talk as he would talk today to americans
let us begin with that his commons agitations
the undertaking which seemed so attractively viewed as literary task proved the most difficult one and at times became oppressive
it was written in and latin
the word hadad to be convinced
for wor should now be set about the origin of luther's common tits
much later when a friend of his was preparing in additions of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way aboute its they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my gits for instance and
in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther a dressed studs and the course of glaciers and roar prepared the man scrip for the printer
it presents like no other of luthers writings the central thought of christianity the justifications of the sinner for the sake of chris merits alone
but the essence of luthers lectures is there
the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do loo too
the word of our gods shall stand forever
in everywhere they so to undermining authority of saint paul
they said to the relations you have no right to think highly of paul
he was the last to turned christ
poking later in his beneath us
indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
do you suppose that god for the sake of a few luther heretics would dis in his entire church
against these boasting false apostles boldly defence his apostolic authority and ministry
as the ambassador of a government is honoured for his office and not fir his private person so the minister of cric should exult his office in ord to gain authority among m
paul t's prim his ministry not to his own phase but to the praise of god
paul in apostle not of men et cetera
y he called ministers tow the agency of men or a calls theme directly as he called the profits in apostles
paa the clays that the false apostles were call her sent neither by men nor by man
the most they could claim is that they were simple others
he mentions the apostles first because they were pointed directly by god
because not to be taken lightly
for persona possess knowledge is not enough
is spoils one's best work
when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his call
i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
i knew nothing of the doctrine faith because we were t so facer instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
this is no sinful pride it is holly pride
in god the father who raised him from for from the dead
the class supervise on first sight
these perverts of the rightness of christ resist the fathering the sun and the works of them both
in this whole epistle paul treats of the resurrection of christ
by his resurrections christ one victory over law son flesh whirl devil death hell and everye evil
first too
and all the breth room which are with me
this should go far and shutting the mouse of the false or poses
although the brethren with me your not apostles like myself yet there all one mind with me think right in teaches id do
they do not go with the enemies of the gospel prominent they go with the questions are
ward they not invaded the catholic princes and preached their doctrine to godless princes bishops and doctors as we have them by the help of god
we look for that reward which i h not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man
navigation ands had become perverted
these means cannot be continent
they remained divine regardless of men's opinions
wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church even though ante grist reams there
so much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the apostle verse three
grace be too you in peace from from god the fathers and from our lore jesus christ
the terms of grace and peace are common terms with paul in are now pretty well under stooder
the greeting of the apostles refreshing
grace and vs remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
the world brands this a permission doctrine
experience process
however the grace in piece of god will
m should not speculate about the nature of god
was it not enough to say from god the fathers
to do so is to lose goot altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek a measure int comprehend his infinite majesty
he came down to earths lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so so that our hearts and eyes m fasten upon him
embrace him and forget about the nature of god
did not christ himself say i am the way in the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
when you are you about the nature of god apart from the questions of justifications you may be as profound as you like
we are to hear christ to has been appointed by the fathers as our divine teacher
at the same time pal confirms our creed that christ is very god
that christ is very revery gods apparent in that pul scribes him divine powers equally with the fathers as for instance the power to the spens grace and peace
to bestow piecing grace lies in the province of god who along concrete his plants the angels cannot
otherwise pul should of written grace from god the fathering peace from lord jesus christ
the carians took cric for a noble in perfect creature superior evened to the angels because by him god created heavens in earth
mohammed also spere of christ
paix to his thin
he never lose sight of the purpose of epistle
not gold silvers or passion lambs or an angel but himself what for
not for a crown or kingdom or our goodness before sins
under score these words for they there are full of comfort for sore consciences
how m we obtain remission of o or since
pianers the man whose nan jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for sence
since christ was given for our sons it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by own efforts
this sentence also to finds our sins as great so great in fact that the whole worlds could not make amends for single son
the greatness of the ransom christs some of god indicates this
the vicious character of sein is brought out by the words who gave himself for sins
but we are careless we make light of sin
we think that by some little worker merit we can dismission
this passage then theres out the fact that all maner solder sin
this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin as a small matter easily taken care of by good works but we must present oursel to gob with a good conscience that we must feel no son before may feel that christ was given for our sins
this atitudes is universal in particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
on the other hand we're not to regard them is so terrible that we must despair

the influence which the tus has exercised upon bes ty is du partly to a misunderstanding
in the suppose depths of the dial the neal platonists found hidden means in connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly corrector sick in him his efforts realized in connect ostracised by them at all
the is danger of the modern com teachers on tires falling into the absurdities of the ne platonists
in the present day we are well awar that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
the fancies of the new plat mists are only interesting to us because they exhibit of pe of the human mind which p revealed wily in the first centuries of the christian ear and is not wholly extinct in our o bay
but they have nothing to do with the interpretations of plat and in spit they are oppose to him
we do not know how play to would have arranged his of dials or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the two traces which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
the dio is primarily concerned with the animal creations including under dree the heavily bodies and with man only as one among the animals
what he has not as yet the fin this immediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and leet mats and he would have felt that there was as great and impiety in winking furies of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
with her rites he acknowledges the perpetual flocks li ane sagas he asserted the pre dance of min although admitting an element of necessity which reasoned is incapable of subduing like the pia gens he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in lumber
many if not all the elements of the priest cric philosophy are included in the tim is
it is probable that the relations of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently we conceived by him at different times of his life
the ideas also remained but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
the style and plan of the tus different greatly from that of any other of the plutonic dials
but plato has not the same mystery over his instrument which he exhibits e the fees or sposi him
nothing in exceeded the beauty or art of the introductions in which his using words after his accustomed manner
but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
he could rise in one style but not in another the greek language had not as y been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
and hence we findin the same sort of zis in the timers of plato which care rises to pillows officer born of l crashes
there is a w of flow and often a defect of rm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater us of oppositions in more of repetition then occurs and platts earlier writings
plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of a

but already at pointed in economic evolution far ant dating the emergence of the lady specialized consumption of goods as in evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to worke out in a mor oral less labor system
the utility of consumption as in evidence of wealth is to be classed as a giv of growth
such consumptions false to the women is nearly incidental to their wor it is a means to their continued labor and not consumptions directed to their own comfort and fullness of life
with a further advance and culture this to b m changed into simple custom of a mor oral less riggs characters but what ever be the theoretical basis of the distinctions which is maintained whether it bea bo or a large of conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumptions do not change easily
in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leasure class
under the to bo certain victuals and m particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the fs of stimulants ever tent in their turn to become horrific as being a mark at the second remove of the superior states of those who are able to afore it the indulgence
it has even happened that the name for certain disease conditions of the body arising from for from such an origin has passed into every day speech as a synonym for
the consumption of luxuries in the true cents his consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
with many qualifications with more qualifications u the patriarchal tradition has gradual weakened the generals ru is fell to be wight and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters
the objections of course presents itself that expenditure and women's dress and household parnell is an obvious exceptions to ro but it will appearing the secret that this exceptions much m obvious ands of essential
the custom of fest of gatherings probably originated in motives of come thei and religion these motives are also present in the later development that they do not continued to be the sol motives
there is a more oral less lerret system of ranking grates
this d fixation is further by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lessen of substance in their own right so that summer them a scarce let all others only partially to beated as my carries consumers

the wearing of uniforms liveries implies a considerable degree of dependance and they even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible
the wearers of uniforms liberius may be redly divided int two classes the free and the curvin or the nobles and the ignoble
but the general distinctions not on mc count to be overlooked
so those offices which are by wight the proper employment of the leisure class are noble's such as government fighting hunting the care of arms an acquits and like in short those which mad be class a su ostensibly predatory employments
whenever as in these cases the menial service questions has to do directly with a prim re leasure employments of fighting in hunting it easily requires a reflected on aff characters
the livery becomes ab noxious to nearly all who are required to wear it

the dependent to was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected lat develop of the institutions when the number of persons by whom these du toy sar customary performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last
but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of o cares leisure in consumptions devolve upon the wife alow
in the communities of the weston culture this points at present found among the lower middle class
if beauty comfort as achieved and it ism less for tu to circumstance if they they must be achieved by means and methods that command themselves to the great economical of voce at efforts
the man of the household also co do something in d diction an indeedy commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slams the man and presently also the children virtual seized to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sol exponent of a households pecuniary decency
very much of squar and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket by the last pretense of pecuniary decencies put away
there is no class and no cry that yielded so objected before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratifications of this higher or spiritual needed
the questions which of the two methods were almost effectively reachd the persons whose convictions it is desired to affects
each will therefore serve about equally well dinging the earner stages of social growth
the mon organizations of industry works in the same directional also v other line
it is evident therefore that the present trent of the development is in the direct of heightening the utility conspicuous consumptions as compared with leisure
it des also noticeable that the sus ability consumptions a means of repute as well as the insistance on it as an element of decency is at its bestest in those portions of the community with the human contact of the individuals widest and the mobility of the populations greatest
consumption be comes large at element in the standard of living in the cited th in the country

the result is a great ma ability of the labor employing printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined in considerable body of workman
under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to fin leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary e relations pretty evenly between them at the outset
but the actual course of development has been somewhat different for from this ideal scheme leisure held the first pace at the start and came told rank fair much above wasteful consumption of goods both a direct exponent of wealth and does an element in the standard of decency during the course i peaceful culture

a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is affected by resorted to make believe men intricate polite observances and social duties of a sermon neal nature are developed many organizations founded with some specious object of amali orations boded in their official stand title there is much coming in going and a deal of talk to the end that the talk is may not ha oc to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their craft
the sailor features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
throughout the entire revolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods of services or human life rends the obvious implications that in order effectually m the consume goods thing it must been an expatiate of superfluities
as use in the speech of every day life the word carries an undertone of depreciation
the use of the word wast as a technical turn therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by consumer under this cannon of conspicuous wist
but it is another grounds worth noting that the turn waste in the language of everyday life in implied depreciation of what is characters s wasteful
in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste at such expenditure as his incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
and toga may be useful and wasteful both and its tilted to consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most fairing proportions

to celebrate the arrival of hers son sylvia gave a splendid supper to which she had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance
without saying it positively she made me understand that being herself and illustrious member of the republic of letters she was well aware that she was speaking to an insect
in order too please her i spoke to her of the abbey conti and i had occasioned to quote two lines of that profound writer
madame corrected me with a patronising air for by pronunciation of the word scored which means divided saying that it ought to be pronounced scare and she added that i ought to be veryain glad to have learn so much on the first day of my arrival in paris telling me that it would be an important day in my life
her face was an ae mah for inspired everyone with the warmest sympathy and yet if you examined it attentively there was not one beautiful feature she gould not be called handsome but no one could have thoughte her ugly
sylvia was the add orations of france and her talent was the real support of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her especially of the plays of marya o for without herr his coes would never have gone to posterity
sylvia did not think that her good conduct was a merit for she knew that she was virtuous only because herself love compelled her to be so and she nevers exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority towards theatrical sisters although satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by virtue
two years before her death i saw her performed the characters of mary anne in the comedy of merri o and in spite of her age and declining health the illusion was complete
she was honorably buried in the church of saints of her without the slightest oppositions from the venerable priest who far from sharing the ant christian intolerance of the clergy in general said that her professions an actress had not hindered her from being a good christian and at the earths was a common mothers of all human beings as jesus christ had been the saviour of all mankind
you will forgive me dear reader if i have made you attend the funeral of sylvia ten years before her death believe me i have no intention of performing a miracle you may console yourself with the idea that i shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor sylvia dies

i thank him and take my leave
i addressed him in italian and he answers veryain but his way of speaking makes me smile and i tell him why
my remark pleases him but i soon proved to him that it is not the right way to speak however perfects m have been the language of an ancient writer
i see a crowd and one corner of the garden everybody standing still on looking up

b how did she managed to render it so fashionable
simply i stopping her carriage two or three times before the shop to have her sough box filled and by saying allow to the young girl who handed back the box that her sough was the veryain best in paris
you are now in the only country in the world where wit c make a fortune by selling either a genuine or of false article in the first case receives the well goeing and talented people and in the second fools or always ready too reward it for silliness as truly a characteristic of the people here and however wonderful it may appear silly miss is the daughter of wit
let a man run and everybody will run after him the crowd will not stop unless the man is proved to be mad but to prove it' is indeed a difficult task because we have a crowd of men who mad from from their barth are still considered wise
it seems to me i replied and such approval such ratifications of the opinion expressed by the king the princes of the blooded cetera is rather reproof off the affections felt forth them by the nations for the french carry that affection to such an extent that they believe them in fallible

on the sixth of april eighteen thirty the church of jesus christ of latter day saints was formerly organized and thus took on a legal existence
its origin was small a germ and insignificant seeded hardly to be thoughts of as likely too arouse oppositions
in sad of but six regularly affiliated members and at most two scour of adherence the organizations today many hundred thousand souls
in place up a single hamlet in the smallest corner of which the members could have congregated there now are about seventy stakes of lion and about seven hundred organized words each ward and stake with its full compliment of officers and priested organizations
the practice of gathering its pros lit into one place prevents the billing up and strengthening of foreign branches and inasmuch as extensive and strong organizations are seldom at with broad very erroneous ideas exist concerning the strength of the church
nevertheless the muster seed among the smallest of all seeds has attain the proportions of a tree and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches the acorn is now in oak offering protections and the sweets of satisfactions to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way fir truth
their eyes were from from the first turned in anticipations toward the evening sun not mealy that the work of pros ling should be carried on in the west but that the head quarters of the church should be there established
the book moment had taught the people the true origin and destiny of the american indians and towards this dark skin remnant of once mighty people the missionaries of mormonism early turned their eyes and with their eyes went their hearts and their hopes
it is notable that the indian tribes have gaily regarded the religion of the latter day saints with favour singing in the book mormon striking agreement with her their own traditions
the first well established seat of the church was in the pretty little town of curt land ohio almost within sight of lake deary and here soon rose the first temple of modern times
to the fervent latter day saint a temple is not simply a church building a house for relies assembly
soon thousands of converts had rented or purchased to homes miserie independence jackson county being their center but from the first they were unpopular among the missions
the lieutenant governor little brent bew bogs afterward governor was a pronounced warm in hater and throughout the period of the troubles he mad ifs is sympathy with the persecutes

making that way across the river most the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of clay county and afterward established themselves in called well county therein founding the city of far west
a small settlement had been founded by mormon families un sho creek and here on the thirties of october eighteen thirty eight accompany of two hundred and forty fell upon the hapless settlers and butcher a score
be it said to the honour of some of the officers intrusted with a terrible commission that when they le its true significance they resign their authority rather than have anything to do with what they des in a cold blooded butchery
oh w a record to read what a pictured the gaze upon how awful the fact
american schoolboys read with emotions of horror of be albigenses driven beaten and killed with a papal legate directing the butchery and nevah dais hunted and hou like beasts as the effective a rail de tree and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as these in the exhibitions of injustice and inhuman hate
who began the quarrel was at the mormons
as dabble of the press comments against at the brutality of the meran's i quote a paragraph from from the quincy argus marched sixteenth eighteen thirty nine
it will be observed that an organized mob aided by many of the civil a military officers of missouri governor bogs at their head have been the prominent actors in this business incited too it appears against the moments by political hatreds and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge
the army found the people in poverty and left them in comparative wealth
but awd further concerning the expeditions in general
it was through voids advised that became and order the military expedition to you ostensibly to install certain federal officials and to repress an leg infant rebellion which in fact had never come into existence but in reality to further the interest of the successions
moreover had the people beene inclined to rebellion wh gat her opportunity could they have wished
already and north and his south were talk do one uns a os a west

what the latter sides calls less of marriage his characteristic up the church and is in veryain general practice but of c less marriage plurality of wives was an incident never an essential
we believe in a literal resurrections and an actual hereafterward feature state shall be recognized every sanctified an authorize relationship existing here on earth of par and child brother in sister husband and wifely
it has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands to observe the customs and studied the habits of more nations one and i yet to find the place in meet to people wearing with whom the purity of man and woman his held more precious then among the mind mormons in the mountain valleys of the west
at the inception of bor marriage among the latter day saints there no law national or state against s practice
in eighteen sixty two a law was act with a purpose of suppressing bal marriage and as had been predicted in the national sate per to its passage it lay many years a dead letter
feeder judges and united states attornies and muta who were not warms nor lovers of womanish refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the laws because of its manifest injustice end inadequacy
this me that fort ledge mister meaner for which congress prescribed a maxim penalty of six months imprisonment and a fine of three hundred dollars a man might be imprison for life i for many terms of a men's natural life to be courts power to enforce it sentences extent so far and might be finde millions of dollars
before this travesty on the administrations of law could be brought before the cort of last resort and there met with the reversal in rebuke it deserved m were imprison under sentence of many years duration
the people contested these measures one by one in the courts presenting in case after case the different faces of the subjects and urging the unconstitutional of the measure
th the church was disan cooperated and its property real and personal confiscated and aged to the government of the united states and although the personal property was soon restored re state of grat value long lay in the hands of the courts receiver and the moran church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property
and so the story of moment ism runs on its finally has not y had been written the current press presents continuously new sties of its progress new developments of its plan

alexander clutched the two hands at his sides
the stop at queen's town the tedious passage up the mercy or things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience
she blushed and smiled and followed his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs
alexander paced up and downy hallway but ning unbuttoning his overcoat until she returned and took him up to hild his living room
the room was empty way entered
alexander did not sit down
i felted in my bones when i woke a s morning that something splendid was going to turn up

what is sling
we have never understood this sword of objections
slang is odious
slang makes one shudder
who did nice that of course it does
when it is a questioned of probing a wounded a go a society since one has it been considered wronged to go too far to going to the bottom
we have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and at least a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted in fulfilled merits
why should one night explore everything and study everything
why should one haul on the way
nothings is more lugubrious than the contemplations thus in its nudity in the broads light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang
now when n has horror ever excluded study
since w has malady banished medicine
can one imagine an naturalist refusing to study the viper the bat the scorpion the speeded the tanta and one who would cast them back into their darkness saying oh how ugly that is
he would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language a philosopher hesitating to scrutinise e fact in humanity
what is slang properly speaking
it is the language of wretchedness
we may be stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms which is one way of attenuating it we may be told that al tat professions it may be added all the accidents of the social higher orkan all forms of intelligence have their own sling
the painter who says my grinder the notary whose says my skip of a gutter the ha dresser whose says my meal back the cobler who says my cube talks slang
there is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the press uses
the sugar manufacturer who says lo clarified lumps bastard common burnt this honest many faction talk slang
algebra medicine bony have each their sling
to meet the means of this conflict wretchedness has invented language of combat withes slang
to keep a float and to rescue from oblivion to hold above the goff where it but a fragments of some language which men has spoken and which would otherwise be lost that is to say one of the elements goode or bad of which civilizations composed or by which it is complicated to extend to the records of social observations is to serve civilizations itself
phoenician veryain goodly
even dial let that pass
to this we reply in one word only
assuredly if the tongue which nations or province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is is stilled more worthy of attention and study
and then we insist upon it the study of social deformities and infirmities and the task of pointing them out with the view to remy is not a business in which choices permitted

there it clothes itself in word masks in mentor f rags
in the skies it becomes horrible

one thinks one here's high dress talking
it is unintelligible in the dark
it is blacking in misfortune it is blacker stilled crime these two blackness is amalgamated compose sling
the earths not devoid of resemblance to a jail

it is is so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment
each day has its own great gree fords little care
yesterday were trembling for health that his dear to you to day you fear for your own to morrowed will be anxiety about money the day aftermath aisle andre the day after that the misfortune of some friend then the prevailing weather then something that has been broken n lost thin a pleasure with which your conscience and youre verb cums reproach you again the course of publick affairs

but who isis fellow plucking at int steve
he is my esquire excellency returned robin with dignity
mistress fitzooth had been carried off by the serfs daughter in her maids as soon as they had entered the house so that robin alone have the care of mony shay
robin was glad when at length they were left to their own devices
the win did certainly bringing back the color to the squire's cheeks
these qui pates or not for old game well lad his day has come to twilight

youre are worthy le will presently whispered robin the wine has worked to marvel

young fitzooth had beene commanded to his mother's chamber so as soon as he had come out from his converts with the squire
there be fell an anxious interview mistress fitz arguing foreign against the squires projecting a breath
most of all rob in thought of his father what would he counsel
if for w you beggar yourself i cannot stay you
but take it whilst live and where month fe sh iss shielded in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so brave sight for you will never disgrace oc touch and i warn at me
the lad eject then
nevers sir he had said
he was in deep converts with the clerk and enter the hall holding him by the arms
now to bed boyd

as any an england i would say said came well proudly that is in his day
yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning his come
there was no chance to altered his sleeping room to one nearer to gain wells chamber
presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step
will cried he softly and stoutly who which chosen his count across the door of his young master's chamber sprang up at once at answer
we will go out together to the bower there is away down to the court from my window
rest and be still until they warn you
the hours passed wearily by and movement could yet be heard about the hall
at last all was quiet and black in the courtyard gamewell
will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready
they then renewed their journey and under the better light meade to save crossing of the stable roofs
robin entered a hot dragging the unwilling quire
be not so foolish friend said fitz oh crossly
they moved there after cautiously about the hut groping before about them to find something to show that the warrenton had fulfilled his mission
they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stoutly had tripped over the edge of the reversed flat mouth of pit
fitz ohs hand rested at last upon the top run of a latter and slowly the truth came to him
robin carefully descended the latter and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground
studley was by his side in the flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and characters of his vault
from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice warrenton's
safely masters but you startled me rarely
cried hee waving the lanthorn before him to make sure that these were no ghost and front of him
inquired robin within his suspicions still upon him
truly such a horse would be worth much in notting him fair
nay lording answered warrenton with a half laugh
warrenton spoke thus with significance to show robin that he was not think jeffreys claims to the estate will be passed by
robin fitzooth saw that his doubts of warrington had been unfair and he became ashamed himself for harboring them
his tones ran pleasantly unworn in's ears and forthwith the goods fellowship was heralded between them
the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gain well this passageway led from the hut in a pleasance to sure wood and that jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
he implores as to be discreet as the grave in this matter for ensue his life is in the hollow of our hands
they regain their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gamewell
out in the woods stood a nice little fer tee
the place he had was a veryain good one the sun shown on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and rounded him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as furs
he did not think of the warm son and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
but this was what the tree couldn not bear to hear
in winter when the snow lag glittering on the ground a hair would often come leaping along and jumped right overt tree
oh that made him so angry
to growl and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that aftermost delight ful thing in the worlds
in autumn the woodcutters always came and felled some of with a largest trees
this happened everye year and the young fir trey that had now grown too a veryain c size trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earths with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked longed and beare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were lading carts and the horses dragged of them out of the wood
have you not neet them any with
rejoice in thy growth saide the sunbeams
and then what happens
i would fain now if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
i am now tall in my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh
where i but al ready on the carts
where i in the wm room with all the splendor in magnificence
yes and something better something still brand will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ornament me
something better something still grander must follow but what
re choice in our presence said the air and the sunlight
rejoice in my owne fresh youths
but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter in summer
and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
the ax struck deepo the veryain pip the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pangs like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful that being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
the departure was not at all agreeable
the tre only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we don't want the others
there too were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture box and full of toys were hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the childrens and so a
the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
this evening they all said
howe it will shinin this evening
perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to lookit me
it blazed up famously help help
cried the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire
story
a story cried the childrens drawing a little fat man towards the tree
but i shall telle only one story
h be don't be fell downstairs and yet he married the princess
that's the way of the worlds
thought the fur tree and believed all because the man who told the story was so good looking well weller
i won't trembled to morrow thought the fir trey
and the whole night the tree stood still and indeed thought
in the morning the servants and the house maine came in
but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
whar's the meaning of this thought the tree
and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie
time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in the corner out of the way
t is now winter out of doors thought the tree
how kind man us
if only would not so dark here and so terribly lonely
squeak squak
they snuffed about the fur tree and rustled among the branches
i am by no means old said the fur tree and
there's many o one considerably older than i am
they were so extremely curious
i know no such place said the tree
and then he told all about his youths and the little mice had never heard the light before and they listened and said
said the fur tree thinking over what he had himself related
yes in reality those wore happy times
who he's up don't p asked the mice
only that one answered the tree
it is a veryain stupids story
don't you know one about bacon and c cans can't shot any lars stories
no said the tree
then good b said the rats and they went home
at last the little ms state away also and the tree side afterwhile passant when the sleek little m sat rounded me and listened to what i told theme
now that too was over
why one morning there came a quantity of people and s to work in the loft
the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and throne rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
but it was not the fur trye that they ms
it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
the golden star of tins was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
in the courtyards some of the married children were playing who had danced at christmas rounded the fur trye and were so glad at the side of him
and the gardeners boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
the wood flamed up splendidly under the large bring copper and its sighed so deeply
however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end

the three modes of management
to suppose that the objects of this work is to aid in affecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and designe
by reason an affections
as the chase drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicions of her mother' disappointment vexations and ill humour serge and swell among those delegate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps and a reparable injury
the mother as soon as the chase is so far turned that marry can no longer watch the expression of her confidence goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfactions on her face at the ingenuity ands excess of her little artifice
so you will be a good' girl i know and that make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't you
the mothers in managing the case in this way razed partly u convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appealed to her affections
if you should not be a good girl but should show signed of makings any trouble's shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone
but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary fort if mary has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble
it is indeed true that the importance of tacked and skill in the training of the younger and of cultivating their reason and securing their affections cannot be overrated
to such persons these indirect modes of training childrens in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
della had a young's sister na and a cousin whose name was jane
now ga contrived to obtain a great influence and as sil sey over the mind of the children by means of these dolls
to give idea of these conversations i will report one of them in full
you have come and della and della was the name of jams to make rosy a visit
i am veryain glad
i expect you have been a veryain goods girls and ella since you were here last
then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone h shep in a good girl jane
for instance one day the children had been plain upon the piazza with blocks and other play things and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
they were now playing with their dolls in the parlour
delia came to the parlour and with an air of great mystery beckon the children aside and set to them in a whisper leave and della and rosy hair and don't say awd them
so saying she led the way onto followed by the childrens out of the room and round by a circus roe to the piazza there
said she pointing to the play things see
put these play things all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know anything about you re leaning them out
and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any directs rebukes or expressions of this pleasure addressed personally too them would have been
nature of the effects produced by early impressions
that is comparatively nothing
they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
without go to any such extreme as this we can easily see on reflections how vast an influence on the ideas and conceptions as well is on the principles of action inure years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood had impress upon the mind
the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a fathers subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
but ands cared nothing about that
he made about so deep that his back came near breaking and he was done founded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but ands
he was such a bigg boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife
now this knife was a splendid one though half the blab was gone and the handle was a little cracked and ands neo that one is al most am man as soon as one has a jack knife

and she took ands hand and walked within him up the broad marvel stairs where soldiers were posted at everyday step and through the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing where ever he went
four like as not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine chap
at the farther end of the largest hall a tablet was set with golden cups and golden plates in longed rose
on huge silver platters were paid of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters
the princess set down under a blue canopy with b ce a roses and she let under sit in a golden chair by her side
but you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to t get off
the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly like to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any conditions
he only shook his head
well but now said the princess and she she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him
that is a veryain fine capt you have he said
so it is said ands
and it is made of mother's best yarn and she knitted that herself and everybody once to get it away from me
with one jumpers got out of his chair
he darted like an arrow through all the halls downe all the stairs and across the yards
he still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their ms open
but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a kings golden crowned he said that enders was a stupid
ands face grew red
but his mother hub close
no my little son shes said
if you dressed him silk and gold from top to to you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap
at the conclusions of the banquet which was served at five o'clock the king entered dis cabinet were his tailors or awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imaginations and had caus so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornate workers of the court
ah veryain well
let a come then said the king and as if call ba had been listening at the door for the purpose of cap in himself a cant with the conversations he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two c years

he has given them with too much grace not to have other still to give if they are required which is the case at the present moment
it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned

your majesty's planed then in this affair is

the new circulated with the rapidity of lightening during its progress at kindled every vot of coquetry desire and wild ambitions
the kan had completed his toilet by nin o'clock he appeared in an opened carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers
the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent days or platforms erected upon the borders of the lake in a theater of wonderful elegance of constructions
suddenly for the purpose of restoring piece in order springing accompanied by his hall court mad his appearance
the seasons alle of springing followed him closely to form a quad trail which afterwards of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the dance
his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage in flesh coloured silken hose a silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
there was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seem to so along
yes it is suppressed
far from it sire your majesty hev given no directions about it the musicians retained
yes si and ready dressed for the vale
sire he said your majesties most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he has already shown on the field of battle
the king seemed only pleased with everyone present
monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter
the valley began the effected was more than beautiful
when the musick by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untired pantomime of that period only the more natural' on account of the veryain different acting of the august actors had reached its commin in point of triumph the theatre shook with tumultuous applause
disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgment he thought of nothing but bubbly regaining the market preference of the princess
by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that as limbs lust their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupified
the king who had from from this moment become in reality the principle dancer in the quad real cast a luck upon his vanquished rival
everyone could observe his agitations and prostration a prostration which was indeedy more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his he bewildered and his eyes with all their bright intelligence bended
upon this madame dean to turn her eyes languishingly towards the compt observing
do you thinks so she replied with indifference
yes the characters which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own
explained yourself
i allude to the goddess
the princess inquired no
she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going tod dance
the arrow peers his heart and wounded him mori
a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theatre but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love is th strangely constituted he founded impossible even to remained much longer separated from from their presence of one who had broken his heart
when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in a bids of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself

while the former for told that the scottish cans were secretly forming a unions with the english parliament and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking the latter still insisted that everye such attempt would precipitate them in into measures too which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined
the king's ears were now opened to mont roses counsels who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cause and scotland
five hundred men more whose had been levied by the cans were persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combined force he hastened to attack lord elk who lay at parthian army of six thousand men assembled upon the first news of the irish invasion
dreading the superior power of argyle who having joined his vessels to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerable army montrose hastened northward in order to rows again the marquis of hup and the gordons who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the combs
this nobleman's charter though celebrated for political courage and conducted was veryain for military price and after some skirmishes in which he was worsted he here allowed montrose to escape him
by quick marches through these inaccessible mountains that general freed himself from the superior forces of the cols
with these and some reenforcements of the eh men and moo darts whom he had receded montrose feal suddenly upon argyle's country and let loose upon it all the rage of war carrying off the cattle burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword
this severity by which montrose sullied his victories was the results of private animosity against the chieftain as much as of zeal for the public cause ar guile collecting three thousand men marched in questioned the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at inter locking supposing himself stills at a considerable distance from from them
by a quick and unexpected march montes hastened to interlock and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised but not a frightened caverns
his conduct and presence of mind in this emergence appeared conspicuous
montrose weak in cavalry here line his troops of horse with infantry and after to putting the enemies horse to rout fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cut in pieces th with the loss of the gallant lord gordon on the part of the royalists
from from the same men new regiments and new companies were formed different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands as the independents gould re l

the analysis of knowledge will occupies until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
what is called perceptions direst from sensations by the fact that the sensational ingredients bringing up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual cortes all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensations
whether not principle is liable too exceptions everyone would agree that it has broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem in overstatement and it might seem more corrected to say that id is approximately represent impressions
and what sort of evidence is logically possible
there is not logical impossibility and the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it th was with the populations that remembered a wholly unreal past
all that i'm doing is to use its logical tin ability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
the behaviour us to attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour hast to trust his memory and making that the record
habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist fills confined that there' is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
but i do not think such an inference is warned
our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and comparative the present image
we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a friends face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
some images like some sensations pill veryain familiar while others fill strange
familiarity a filling capable of degrees
in an image of a well known face for example some parts may fl more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must ha have in order too account for our knowledge of the past
they must have some characteristic which makes us regarded them as preferring too more or less remote portions of the past
in actual fact their are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the flinging of greater or less remoteness and some remembered event
there may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of pasts especially where immediate memory is concerned
there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relations of a remembered ev to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of fillings giving their temporal relations to the present but it is clear that such fillings must play an essential part in the process of dating remember events
if we had retained subjects or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
remembering has to be a present occurrence and someway resembling or lighted too what is remembered
some points may be taken as fixed and such any theory of memory must arriv at
in this case as in most others what may be taken a certain and advance is rather v
the first of our vague but indubitable data set there as knowledge of the past
we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the pasts which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definitions would at least served to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediate sey
this distinctions vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate too us the incidence of its past and people are not so different from grandi fons as they like to believe
i can sent to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to e for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me tod do this
the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasioned on which he has recited or red it
symons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images referred to pass occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge
it is this that is a venturous to theory of knowledge
it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusions that all that is happening now happened before at some time
whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it lees us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have founded the appropriate objects which leads us to the judgement this is familiar
thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from for from the flinging of familiarity alone
a further stage is recognition
recognitions in this sense does not necessarily involve more that a habit of associations the kind of object we are seen at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an ot toy image of paring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognise in the cat of the moment
we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an objected that we have seen it before but this judgment as something over and above recognitions in this firsts sense and may very avery probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognitions in this first sense of the word
this knowledge is memory and one sense though in another it is not
there are however several points in which such an account of recognitions is inadequate to begin with it m seem at first sight more corrects to define recognition as i have seen this before then as this has existed before
the definitions of my experience is difficulty broadly speaking it is everything thats connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
thus if i recognize the thing the occasions of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognized it forms part of my experience by definitions the recognitions will be one of the marks by which my experience is single out from the rest of the world
of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translations of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thoughte which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
i remained there alone for many hours but i musick knows that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light

this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure i i did not agree with
then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part fathers and mothers of the young ladies
oh yes said jack and i nowhere
but i mean to have my endings before long
of what missus never been had gone through and providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplish her task with thorough successes
we sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then when assure
how much of evil of real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me during the last few days
what c i do now but just lay myself down and die
and the death of which i dram couldn alas

jack would become ev this happy husband and would remain amidst the harry duties of the eager world
thinking all this i went slye
mister never bend began the captain and i observe that up to that moment he had generally address me as presidents there cannot be den that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
you have received us with all that curtesy in hospitality for which her characters in england stands so high
it is a duty said i
but your power is so superi to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace and yielding to it
not a doub but had your fore s been only doublet or trouble our own i should have found at my duty to struggle with you
that is all quite true mister never been said sir ferdinand brown
i can afford to smile because i am absolutely parlous before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the worlds concerned aye or rather we haven been put down by my brute force
you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republick to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have had been on bo
then said sir fer nanda there's nothing fort but that we must take you with him
there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt

what world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crust them both by my words had up been possible my dislike centered itself on sero

and yet what a fine gallant bladed
not once to he comment on the length or the hardships of the journey
never did he object to buckling up his suit case for any country whatever china or the congo no matter how far off it was
he went here there and everywhere and perfect contentment
pas forget me for this underhanded way of admitting that i had turned forty
he was a pic on formality and he only addressed me in the third person to the point were it got hires
there was good reasoned to stop and think evened for the worlds most emotionless man
conall say i called a third time conseil appeared

but were going just the same
we have a commander whose game for anything
i left instructions for shipping my contains of stuffed animals and dried plants to paris france
i open the line o credit sufficient to cover the buba and conseil at my heels i jumped into a carriage
our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate i rushed aboard
i asked her commander fag
one of the sailors led me to the afterdeck where i stood in the presence of a smart looking officer who extended his hand to me
in in person welcome aboard professor your cabin is waiting fort you
i was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officer's ms

and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or evened less the fet would have gone without me and i would have missed out on u earthly extraordinary in inconceivable expeditions whose tu story might well meet with some skis
the wars of brookland e everye of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers
departing from five hundred thousand throats three cheers burst forth in successions
thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hinging the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the huts and river at the tip of the long pons of that forms new york city
then he rushed downstairs into the courtyard shouting loudly foras his soldiers and threatening too patch everybody his dominions at the sailorman was not recaptured
hold him fast my man and as soon as ive had my coffee and ole i'll take him to the room of the great knife and pat him
i would you mind tok goff myself said cap i have had consider ber tits eyes this moran and an all ey for breakfas
but cap'n bill made no such attempt knowing it would be useless
as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boo ga a yellow disappointment
the room of the great knife was high and bigg and around it ran rose of benches for the spectators the situ upon
in one blace at the he of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant thrown chairs for the king and quaint and six smaller but richly post her chairs for this nod's princesses
therefore her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her
rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as cori s as as the were haughty and overbearing
marny girls bevil as wells you look
control yourselves my dears replied the bloo the worst punishment i know how do him loo on any this prisoners b to suffer you will see a veryain pretty patching my royal daughters
suppose its of brain
the captain shook his head
why you sic thatch that thir slitting cru met and that was dispatch replied the captain panting hard as held fs to one the goats worms
the idea patching cap'n bill to a goat was a vastly amusing to him and a more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter
they look something al you know suggested the captain of the guards looking from one to the other doubtfully and then nearly the same ses it you stand above on his hind legs they' both got the same stile of whiskers and the both of them obstinate in dan des so they ought to make a good patch slid
fine paris
when this had been accomplished the boolooroo leaned overt to tri do you a discover wide the frame rowed away seemingly of its own a cord and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before
at once the goat gave a leap escape from the sods and with bou head rushed upon the boo
before any could stopped him he boded his majesty so furiously that the king swords far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay ming and groaning
the goats warlike spirit was roused by the successful tack
then they sped in great haste for the door and a go gave a final but this in the ro of royal ladies all died into the corridor in anotherin tangle where u may shrieked in a mater that terrified everyone of th sound of their voices
i the notions you mad d save me from from the knife
i didn't shut a much being bounds tight but wo singing to have j sone but shiver to relieve my feelings
coming that the b r she s going toward the benches
so they were quite willing to obey the orders of their girl quam and in a short time the glass of trumpets and rolla of drums and clashing of semples told trot and captain bill that the blue bands had assembled before the palace
then they all march shout a little way into the fields and found that the army of thinks had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them
at the head of the pinkies were get ghisizzle and by e bright who had the pair on hiss shoulder and there were supported by captain cory and captain t tent and rosily the which
when the blueskin sawed git kisses all they raised another great shout for he was the favorite of the soldiers and veryain popular with all the people
since last thursday i gi ges all have been a lawful blue ro of the blue country but now that you are conquered by queen shot i suppose i am compt and you have no bo at all
when he fe is shes said cheerfully

then she gave rose back her minting thanking the kind which for all she had done ford them

it will be such a satisfactions
the guards had a terrible struggle with a goat which was loos in the room and still w to fight but finally they subdued the animal and then they tok the bor out of the fringing ti in and brought bothy goat before queen trot who waited them in the thrown room of the palace
i'll gladly do that promised the new boom an i feed the honorable go all all the shavings and leather ten cans gat besides the grass
excuse me said shot i neglect tell you that you're not the boor any more
the former biliary ground
hy wicked anymore sid the old bloo how reformed
as a private citizen i shall be a mode of deportment because it would be dangers to be otherwise
when first they entered the thrown room they tried to be his haughty and scornful as ever but the blues who were as simple there all laughed at them and jeered them for there was not a single person in all the blue country who love the princess is the least little bit
so gi gases or order the captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home
that evenings trot gave a grand ball and the palace to which the moste important of the pinkies in the blueskins were invited
the combined bands of both the countries played the musica and a fine supper was served
brighter than early dawns most brilliant die are blown clear bands of color through the sky that swirl and sweeps and meet to break and found like rainbow veils upon bove os done
guided by you how we might stroll towards death our only music one another's breath through garden's intimate with hollyhocks where silent poppies burned between the rocks by pools where burgs band toy confidence above green waters scum with a lily plans
venice
in a sunset glowing of crimson and gold she lives the glory of the world a beached king's galley whose sails are fl who was hun with tapestries rich and old
the pity that we must come i go
while the old gold the marbles days f for ever glim me it soft strong blaze call in early evening glow
the pleasant gr yard of my soules with sentimental cypress trees and flowers is filled that im may stroll and meditations at my ease
it is my heart hung in the sky and no clouds ever float between the greve flowers and my heart on high
over the track lin city street the young man the grinning m pass
h y sails that seemed to wonder in dream thrilled meadows say is the shore where i stand the only filled of struggle or are ye hid and better out there by waves and wust as he tack over a clashing sea of watery echoes
old dances are simplified of their yearning bleached by time
he had got into her courtyards
through the black night rain he sang too her window bars
that was but rustling of dripping plans in the darken
she was alone that night
he had broken into her courtyard
to fad away like morning beauty from from her mortal day down by the river of a dana her soft voices heard and thus her gentle lamentations falls like morning doe
o life of this are springing
why fades the loads of the water
why fad these children of the spring
fell is like a watry bow and like aping clouded like a reflections in a glass like shadows in the water like dreams of infants like a smile upon it an infants face
like the debs voice like transient day like musick in the air ahhh
and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gently here the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time
the ly of the valley bathing in the humble grass answered the love we maiden said i am a watch re weeded and i am veryain smalls and left to dwell in lowly veils so weak the gilded butter fly scarce purchase on my head yet i am visited from heavens and he that smiles on all walks in the vall and each morn over me spreads his hand saying rejoice thou humble grass thou newborn lily flower
thou gentle made of silent valleys and of modest brooks for thou shall be clothed in light and fed with morning mana till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs to flourish in eternal veils they why should fell complained
why should the mistress of the veils of har utters
she ceased and smiled and tears then sat downed in her silver shrine
which thou dust scatter on everye little blade of grass thats springs revives the milked cow and tames the fire breathing steeds
but thou is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun i vanish from my pearl throne and who shall find my place
and why it scatters its bright beauty through the human air
descend a little cloud and hover before the eyes of fell
o little cloud the virgin said i charged the to tell mee why thou complain now when in one hour thou fate away then we shall seek mee but not find ah fell is like to thee
i pass away yet i complain and no one' hears my voice
the cloud then showed his golden head and his bright form emerged
and forest thou because i vanish and am seen no more
it is too tenfold lifely to love to peace and raptures hy unseen descending way my light wings upon balmy flowers and cort the fair i do to take me to her shining tent the weeping virgin trembling meals before the risen sun
till we arise linked and a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers
lives not alone nor of itself fear not and i will call the weak worm from from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear it's
come forth warm and the silent valley to thy pensive queen
the helpless warm or rose and sat upon the les leaf and the bright cloud sail on to fined his partner in the veil
image of weakness art thou but a worm
i see they lay helpless the naked weeping a none to answer none to cherish with mother's smiles
and says thou mothers of my children i have loved thee and i have given the a crown that none can take aways
and lay me downing in i cold bed and leave my shining lot
or an i have gifts and graces showering fruits and coined gold
why a tongue impressed with honey from from everye wind
why an ear a worl poo fierce to draw creations in
alway said without a word
i sit beneath thy looks as children do in the noon sun with souls that tremble through their happy islands from an une verd yet pron inward joy
i did not wrong myself so but i placed a wrong on thee
when called before i told how hastily i dropped my flowers or break off from again
shall i never miss home talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes too each in turn nor counted strange when i look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home and this
alas i have grieved so i am hard to love
open thy hard wide and folded within the wed wings of thy do
couldn me to last love said pendulous betweens sorrow and sorrow
nay i rather thrilled distrusting every light that seemed to gil the onward path and fear to over lean a finger even
and though i have grown serene and strong since then i think that god his willed a still renew ble fear
o love o trots
and love be faults
if he to keep one oh must lose one joy by his life's star fort
slowed to world greetings quick with its o lest when the angel speak
a ringing of aeth i could not ware here player too my sight then that first kiss
that the chrism of lovee which loves own crowned with sanctifying sweetness did proceeded the third upon my lips was folded down in perfects purple state since when indeed i have been proud and said my love my own
dearest teach me so to po out gratitude as thou dust good
mussulmans and guys through curtius at a smile and have no ruth fort any weeping
but thou art not such a lover my beloved
thou canst wait through sorrowing sickness to bringing souls to touch and think it soon when others cry too late
i think all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and lovee from mine
oh to shoot my souls f meaning into future years that they should lend it utter its and salute love that endures from life that disappears
then i long tried by natural ills received the comfort fast while budding at thy sight my pilgrims staff gave out green lees with morning dos
i love the freely as men strive for right i love the purely as they turned from pays
i love thee with the passion putt use in my all greats in with my childhood's faiths
i love thee with love i seemed to lose with my lost saints i love thee with the breaths smile tears of all my life and if god choose i shall but love thee better
