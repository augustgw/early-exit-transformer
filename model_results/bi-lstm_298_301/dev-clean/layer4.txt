it a moments peggy was on the stage again an alexander a plotted vigorously with the rest
in the half light he looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously recalling with amusement sir harry's judicial frowned
he leaned forwards and beamed felicitations is warmly as maine ha himself when at the end of the play she came again and again before the curtain panting a little and flushed her eyes dancing and her eager nervous little mouth tremulous with excitement
all the s he lifted his glass here's to you little hilda
i'm glad shes held her own sense
it was youths and poverty in proximity had everything was yell and kindly
the last two days of the voyage bartle found almost intolerable
emerging up euston at half past three o'clock in the afternoon alexander had his lugged sent to the savoy and drove at once to bedford square
she blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs
the room was empty when he entered
a coal fire was crackling in the great and the limps were lit for it was already beginning to grow dark outside
she called his name on the threshold but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it
she merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder
i never seemed it would be you bartle
when did you come partly and how did had happen you haven't spoken a word
she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head threshed forward like a catapult in niche
i'll do anything you wish me too barley she said tremulously
he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
hild watched him from her corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows going about her eyes

she bit her lip and looked down at her hands which were clasped tightly in front of her
could you could you sit down and talk about it quietly bartle as if i w a friend and not someone who had to be defied
he dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire
i have thought about it until i am worn out
after the veryain first
hilda face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been
she pressed his hand gently in gratitude weren't you happy then at all
something of their troubling sweetness came back to alexander two
presently it stole back to his coat sleeve
yes helder i know that he said simply
i understand barley i was wrong
she listened intently but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair
you want m to said she whispered
bartle leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth
it's got to be a clean break helder
oh bartle what a i to two
you ask me to stay away from you because you want me
i will ask the least imaginable but i must have something
hilda sat on the arm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders
you see loving someone as i love you makes the whole worl different
and then you came back not caring very much but it may no difference
she slided to the floor beside him as if she were too tired to sit up any longer
don't cry don't cry he whispered
on the last saturday in april the new york times published an account of the strike complications which were delaying alexander's new jersey bridge and stated that the engineer himselfe was in town and at his office on west tenth street

then there are in all classes a veryain large number of men constantly occupied with the series affairs of the government and those whose thoughts are not engage in the direction of the commonwealth are wholly engrossed by the acquisitions of a private fortune
i do not believe in such republics any more than in that of plato or if the things we read off really happened i do not hesitate to affirm that these supposed democracies were composed of the veryain different elements from ours and that they had nothing in common with letter except their name
in aristocracies everye man as one so objects which he unceasingly pursues but amongst them ago nations the existence of man is more complex the same mind were almost always embrace several objects at the same time and these objects are frequently wholly foreign to each other as it cannot knowe them all well the mind is readily satisfied with imperfect notions of each
tatter sixteen why the national vanity of the americans is more restless and captures thane of the english
the americans in their intercourse with strangers appear impatient the smallest censer and insatiable of praise
if i say to an american that the country he lives in is a fine one ay he replies there is not its fellow in the worlds
if i applaud the freedom which it inhabitants anden joy he answers freedom is a fine thing but few nations are worthy to enjoy it
in aristocratic countries the great possess immense privileges upon which their pride rests without seeking to rely upon the lesser a volga which are cru of them
they therefore entertained calms sense of their superiority they do not dream of fu in privileges which everyone perceives at no one contests and these things are not sufficiently knew to them to be made topics of conversation
they stand unmoved in their solitary greatness well assured that their sen of all the worlds without any effort to show themselves off and at no one will attempt to drive them from that position
when an aristocracy carries on the public affairs its national pride naturally assumes this reserved indifferent and haughty form which is imitated by all the other classes of the nation
these persons then displayed toward each other precisely the same pure jealousies which animate the men of democracies the same eagerness to snatch smallest advantages which o equal contested and the same desire to parade ostentatiously those of which they were in possessions

then he rang the bell no answer
he rang again this time harder still no answer
when hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greater quandary than ever
he could hardly realize how it had all come about
no letter had come no word of any kind and yet here it was late in the evenings and she had agreed to meet him that morning
he saw that in the excitement of reason events he had not formulated a plan upon that score
he was getting some big comfort out of a good se farre but it was no pasha for the ill which affected him
it was with great opposition after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial that at last he got a envelop placed in it the requested amount and slowly sealed it up
then he called harry the boy of all work around the place
you take this to this address he said handing him the envelope and give it to missus hurstwood yes sir said the boy
any answer i guess not
the boy hastened the way and the manager fell to his musings
he was beaten for tonight and he might just as well make the bestest of it
she would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed
if he only had that letter back he wouldn't send it
for relief he arose and joined in the conversation with a few friends who were drinking
all the time his thoughts would run out to his home and see the scene being baron enacted
in about an hour and three quarters the boy returned
he fancied as he sat at his desk that nothing would be done for o a week or two meanwhile he would have time to think
how about that now his pain at her failure to meet aright him rapidly increased as he devoted himself to the subjects
he decided to write her care of the west side post office and ask for an explanation as well as to have her meet him
three clock came four five sixth and no letter
the helpless manager pasted the floor and grimly endured the gloom of defeat
he thought a busy saturday ushered out the sabbaths and nothing done
all day the barbe en closed he rooted alone shut out from home from the excitement of his resort from carry and without thea ability to alter his condition one ada
it was the worst sunday he had spent in his life
it seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning
he was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angered of his perfidy
he had loved her earnestly enough but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive
he would go to her u tell her all his family complications
he would explained to her just where he stood and how much he needed her
he did manage to bring himselfe into the mooded to go out to carry but when he gott in ogden place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away
he did not low within a block of the house
he travelled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody
he stayed at his desk long after all others had gone and only quitted it when the nights watchman on his round pulled that the front door to see if it was safely locked
on wes day he received another polite note from macgregor james in hay it read
dear sir we beg to inform you that we are instructed to wait until tomorrow thursday at one o'clock before filing suit against you on behalf of missus julia hurstwood for divorce and alimony
very truly yours et cetera compromise
so here it was bread out clear before him and now he knew what to expects
if he didn't go and see them they would sue him promptly
preface to the second edition
this is a mistake though perfectly natural one
on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last revise to the printer
then i had much pleasure in reading it but was indeed surprise that the many little points of similarity between the two books in spite of their entire independence to one another
i regret that reviewers have in some cases ban inclined to treat the chapters o machines as an attempt to reduce mister darwin's theory to an absurdity
i am surprised however that the book at which such an example of the specious ms use of analogy would see most naturally leveled should have occurred to no review neither shall i mention the name of the poker though i should fancy that the hint given will suffice
but this had an effective which i have little reason to complain fry was allowed almost to call them life long self deceivers to their faces and they said it was quite true but that it did not matter
i must not include without expressing my most sincere thanks to my critics and to the public for the leniency and consideration with which they have treated my adventures
it was written an the upper regatta district of the canterbury province as a d was of new zealand at appa at christchurch in the press newspaper jude thirteenth eighteen sixty three
i also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the musical banks and the trial of a man for being in a consumptions
i see from my second preface that i took the book to monsieur's chapman and hall may first eighteen seventy one and on their rejection of it under the advice of one who is attained the highest d rank amongst living writers i let it sleep till i took it to mister trubner early in eighteen seventy two
i attribute its un looked for success mainly to two early favourable reviews the first in the pal mall gazette of april twelfth and the second and the spectator of art tenths
there was also another cause
the first addition of ian selden about three weeks i had not taken moulds and as the demand was strong it was set up again immediately
i made a few further veryain trifling alterations before mules were taken but since the summer of eighteen seventy two as new editions were from time to time wanted they have been printed forster than made
i am still fairly well satisfied with those parts of eau that were repeatedly re written but from those that had only a single writing i would gladly cut out some forty or fifty pages if i could
this however may not be for the copyright will probably expire in a little over twelve years
if the reader will excuse me i will say nothing of my antecedents nor of the circumstances which led me to leave my native country the narrative would be tedious to him and painful to myself
it will be seen that i did not succeeded in my design and that however much i may have met with that was new and strange i have been unable to reep any pecuniary advantage
no one who is himselfe honest will doubt my being so
i reached my destination in one of the last months of eighteen sixty eight but i dare not mentioned the season lest the reader should gatherin which hem sphere i was
sheep in cattle were introduced and bred with extreme rapidity men took up their fifty thousand or one hundred thousand acres of country going inland one behind the others till in a few years there was not an acre between the sea and the front ranges which was not taken up and stations either for sheep or cattle were spotted about an intervals of some twenty or thirty miles over the whole country
i was delighted with the country and the manner of life
i was to see the sheep not necessarily close at hand or to get them in a single mob but to see enough of of them here and there to feel easy that nothing had gone wrong this was no difficult matter for they were not above eight hundred of them and being all breeding use they were pretty quiet
they were good many sheep which i knew as two or three black us and a black lamb or two and several others which had some distinguishing mark whereby i could tell them
it is surprising how soon the eye becomes accustoms to missing twenty sheep out of two or three hundreds
it was a monotonous life that it was veryain healthy and one does not much mind anything when one as well
the country was the grandest that can be imagined
so lonely and so solemn with a sad gray clouds above and no sound save a lost lamb bleeding upon the mountainside as though it little heart were breaking
each must cry louder and wander farther yet may luck be with them both that they may find their own at nightfall
i had no money but if i could only find workable country i might stock it with borrowed capital and consider myself a maid man
there was no one in the whole world who had the smallest idea save those who were themselves on the other side of it if indeed there was anyone at all could i hoped to cross it
i would tri the near arrange and see how far i could go
shortly after passing one of these chapels we came suddenly upon a village would started up out of the mist and i was alarmed lest i should be made an object of curiosity or dislike
my guides however were well known and the natural politeness of the people prevented them from putting me to any inconvenience but they could not help eyeing me nor i them
the streets were narrow and unpaved but very fairly clean
the vine gr outside many of the houses and there were some with signboards on which was painted a bottle and a glass that made me feel much at home
even on this ledge of human society there was a stunted growth of shop lets which had taken r and vegetating somehow though as in an air mercantile of the bleak
each feature was finished eelids eyelashes and ears being almost invariably perfected
their expression was divine and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips and great bewilderment i forgot all thoughts of their conversion and feelings that were far more earthly
even in middle age they were still comely and the old great haired women at their cottage doors had a dignity not to say majesty of their own
the men's handsome as the women beautiful
i have always delighted in and reverenced beauty but i felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type a compound of all that his best an egyptian greek in italian
the children or infinite in number and exceedingly marry i need hardly said that they came in for their full share of the prevailing beauty
i expressed by signs my admirations and pleasure to my guides and they were greatly pleased
the country was highly cultivated every ledge being planted with chestnuts walnuts and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering
i saw a few sheep with rounded noses and enormous tiles
in about four hours of walking from the timely started and after passing two ort three more villages we came upon a considerable town and my guides made many tempts to make the understand something but i gathered no inkling of their meaning except that i need be under no apprehension of danger
suffice that i found myself take him before the chief magistrate and by his orders was placed in an apartment with two other people who were the first i had seen looking anything but while in handsome
in fact one of them was plainly veryain much out of health and coughed violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it
the other look pale and ill but he was marvelously self contained and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him
they felt my pulse they looked at my tongue they listened at my chest they felt all my muscles and at the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded and something in a tone quite pleasant as though i were all right
but by a by they came to my watch which i had hidden away in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search
again there was a very old carriage whose wheels in spite of rust and de kay i could see had been designed originally for iron rails
we pass many cases and at last came no one in which there were several clocks of two or three old watches
the desired was different but the thing was clearly the same
this head some effecting calming him
he began presently to relent and spoke me in a kinder manner
imagine there was several kinds of old fashion christmases but could hardly be worse than a chop at my chambers or horror of horrors at the club where my cousin lucie's notion of what she calls the festive season
festive yes
the reply was written and a sprawling feminine hand it was a little vague
it appeared that the terms would be five guineas but there was in no mentions of the length of time which that fee would cover
the who thing was a trifled
there was nothing set about the sort of accommodation which would be provided nothing about the kind of establishment which was maintained or the tablet was kept
now it is a remarkable thing that i have always had an extraordinary predilection for th name madge i do not know why
i have never known image and yet from my boyhood upward i have desired to meet one
under such circumstances she was hardily likely to be lively herself but her name was mag and it was the accident of her christian name which decided me to go
i had no allusions
i did not expected princely entertainment
all night it had been blowing and reigning
i felt quite lively myself as i mingled with the christmas crowd looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous
i even bought something from madge i mean missus wilson
it was a horrible journey
he was impervious to reason
it is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that i made it warm for the officials however cold i might have been myself
when at last i reached crofton my journey's end it turned out that the station staff consisted of a half witted individual who was stationed master porter and clerk combined and a hulking lad who did whatever else there was to do
no one had come to meet me the village was about a half a mile and hanger dean the house for which my steps were bent about four miles by the road how far it was across plough fields my informant did not mention
there was a trap at the boy and blunderbuss but that required fetched
when the trap did appear it looked to me uncommonly like an opened spring cart
in it i was deposited with my luggage
i did not know what he meant
i did not ask i was beyond it
i was chilled to the bone wet tired hungry
i had longer been wishing that an old fashioned christmas had been completely extinct before i had thought of adventuring in quest of one
here we be that might be so
there' be the door in front of you you go up three steps if you can find him
there's a knocker if none of em heaven twisted it off
there appeared to be no knocker though whether it had been twisted off was more than i could say
no answer though i allowed a more than decent interval
bettering again suggested the driver hard
may bee there up to some of their games and wants rousing
the bell reverberated through what seemed like an empty house
presently feet were heard advancing along the passage several pairs it seemed and a light gleam through the windows over the door
a voice inquired who is there
the information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter
there was a rush of retreating feet an expostulating voice th darkness again and silence
who lives here are the people mad
i told the bell again
after a vast amount of unfastening the door was opened and on that threshold there stood a girl with a lighted candle in her hand
i mister christopher from london
we've lost the key of the cellar and there's nothing out except water and i don't think you'd care for that
her fathers is a most remarkable person to say the least
but it is quite plain to me that all the arrangements for my wedding are going to be made by the snelling
i do not know when it is going to be but it will be either next week or the week after certainly at the earliest possible moment and i shouldn't be at all surprised to learn that all mari ann's things have been already bought and perhaps some of them marked
it is most delightful
it might just as well be someone else is wedding so unimportant is the part which i am said to play in it
for instance look at their behaviour in the matter of the ring
the accident and questioned occurred upon the sunday evening
the girl is fretting but you don't seem to notice it
i guessed positively guessed
that's it on your recount
from a cousin of ours whose in that line
i never saw a people like the snelling for possessing relatives and al sorts of lines
i was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a profit out of marianne's en casement ringing but i handed it over the amounts
it is from her actions in that matter that my suspicion springs
there she owns a cottage or it may be a pigsty for all i know
when she heard of my engagement with mary anne she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honeymoon in her cottage or pigsty and that i should pay her rent for it
there were no signs of faltering about her flow of language
i found that as a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations
it turned out that she had a little money of her own about a hundred and thirty pounds a year
and of course i had my expectations and she had hers
it was plain that together we should manage most comfortably delightfully in fact
i shall make papa give me five hundred pounds at least
a bird in the hand is worth two in a bush and it will be something to have by us
i know what mamma can afford to give and i will see if she gives it
and i will see that there is no shirking about the boys or about the girls either
i have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present and i shall tell them what they ought to givee it won't be my fault if i don't yet it
of course there are some people with whom you can't be perfectly plain but i shall be as plain as i can there's away and a manner of dinging that kind of thing
hers has been prodigious
she has a knack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants which is a little short of miraculous
i notice that they are generally persons who have already tendered their offerings
the fact of having given marianna wedding present seems to fill them with a feeling of rancorous acidity which to me is inexplicable
such is the selfishness of human nature
but why on that account they should pity me i altogether fail to understand
we have all been giving maryann presence and i suppose you mister widing have been giving her something too
that was what missus mc pherson said to me only the other day
and what inquired missus mack pherson has maryann given you her love
some u sniggered
i can not pretend to explain why except on the supposition that romances dead at least in that circle of society in which the snelling move
as it is unless i am mistaken some of the rending will be on our side and they know it
pierce the cards are out for the wedding
we are going for our honeymoon to italy and the south of france
a second cousin of mary ann's is in the cooks tours line
he has given us free passes all the way to the end of our journey and all the way back again and coupons for free board and lodging at the hotel it's wedding present
besides which we can always sell the coops and railway passes which we don't use
he was young no spear had touched him no poison lurked in his wine
i tell you it is not poison she cried
since his birth he has been guarded so closely that the cleverest poisoners of the east couldn not reach him
as you will know there are ten men and ten women whose so duty is to taste his food and wine and fifty armed warriors guard his chamber as they guarded now
a low confused moan wan from his mouth
the man shrugged his broad shoulders and turned back into the arabesque chamber
this man was clad in a browned camel hair robe been sandals and a green turban was on his head
not until the heavens were in the proper order could they performed this necromancer
with a long stained finger nail he m the constellations on the marble tiled floor
the slant of the moon paged evil for the king of via the stars are in turmoil the serpent in the house of the elephant
point of contact inquired the others
all discarded portions of the human body still remained part of it attached to it by intangible connections
but at the urgent entreaty of the princess of casal who loved bund chan vane he gave her a lock of his long black hair as a token of remembrance
by which a soul is drawn from its body and across gulfs of echoing space returned the man on the matt
on the dais under the golden dome the king cried out again racked by awful paroxysms
they seek to snap the silver cord that bias me to my dying body
they cluster ar me their hands are talent their eyes are red like flame burning in darkness
their finger seer me like fire
i know now what brings me to the pyre
there they strove to break the silver cord of life and thrust my soul into the body of a foul knight weird their sorcery summoned up from hell ah
you'll cry and the grip of your fingers brought me back but i am going fast
there was the old imperious note in his failing whisper
you have never disobeyed me oh b my last command
send my soul cream to assure
they also found a martian calendar the year had been divided into ten more or less equal months and one of them had been doma
bill chamber zoologist have been going deeper and deeper into the old sea bottom of sirs
that took the center of interest away from archaeology and started a new burst of activity
the civilian specialists in other fields and the space force people who had been holding tape lines and making sketches and snapping cameras were all flying to lower sirius to find out how much oxygen there was and what kind of life it supported
they had four five species of what might loosely be called birds and something that could easily be classed as a reptile and a carnivorous mammal the size of a cat with birdlike claws and herb vor almost identical with the pig like thing in the big dark hull of a mural and another like a gazelle with a single horne in the middle of its forehead
the daily news cast from tara showed a corresponding shift in interest at home
tots found the martians
it was locked from me inside and we had a burnet down with a torch that's where they are
la standish who had dropped in for lunch was on the meanin fairly screaming into a radio pon extension doesn't an half of them
well of course they dead what a questioned
martha remembered the close door on the first survey they hadn't attempted opening it
now it was burned away at both sides and lay still hot along the edges on the floor of the big office room in front
a flood light was on in the room inside and latimer was going a round looking at things while a space force officers stood by the door
mass suicide that's what it was notice its in the corners
yes charcoal
so they just came in here and lit the charcoal and sat drinking together till they all fell asleep
the tarring public wanted to hear about martians and if live martians couldn't be found a room full of dead ones was the next best thing
tony latimer the discoverer was beginning to cash in on his attentions to gloria and his ingratiation with sid he was always either making voice and image talks for tics or listening to the news from the home planet
without questions he had become overnight the most widely known archologist in history
not that i'm interested in all this for myself he disclaimed after listening to the tlees from tara two days after his discovery
bringing it to the public attentions dramatize it
so i believe i shall go back at least for awhile and see what i can do
lectures
the organization of a society of martian archaeology with anthony latimer p ac d the logical candidate for the chair
i'll be glad to try sir he replied
inside a secret rocket teetering device was mountain on its test
this is in part of your testing routine is it
another engineer rushed towards the door to see what was happening outside
electronic equipping cascaded from the wall shelves and a heavy duty chain hoist came loose from its overhead track plunging to the four with a terrifying crash
an instant later it crashed over pining mark favor beneath it
bu threw up his arms to protect himself but too late
for minutes no one stirred amongst the wreckage
then tomb who had been stunned by some falling de brie raised himself to a sitting positions
tom's eyes focused in horror on the wreckage vel by still billowing dust
the sky was visible through several gaping holes in the roof which was sagging dangerously on it supporting tresses
the younger viner had just noticed his friend lying pin beneath a heavy beam near by
his friend's eyelids flickered
we'd better not try to move him tom decided we'll get an ambulance
they picked their way through the wreckage and emerged on a scene of frightful destruction
lets see about getting help for mister favor
and the only truck we had available was in that burning shed the superintendent added bitterly
anyhow we want to help got a job for us
within minutes tom was in charge of clearing away rubble and extricating anyone who might be trapped inside the buildings
the telephone line was soon repaired and a steady stream of rescue vehicles began arriving from harkness fire trucks three ambulances and private cars driven by volunteers
the two girls were as much upset as tom's mother tom laughed
mister swift came into the living room just then and told tom how worried missus swift and sandy had been
he smiled guiltily as he added but i must admit i was more than a little concerned myself
he's a great scientist
tomb nodded unhappily
male or female human or animals
mister swift's eyes twinkled
fortunately will halley was not a man in a hurry and did not use oppressive canvas or his mass would inevitably have come down
john mangles therefore hoped that the wretched hall would reach port without accident but it grieved him that his companions should have to suffer so so much discomfort from the defective arrangements of the brig
their friends did their bestest to amuse them him
their minds were so distracted at this change of rout as to be quite unheeded
much as they had been interested in his dissertation on the pompous or australia his lectures on new zealand fell unco and indifferent ears
his eyes wandered ceaselessly over the blind c horizon
what then my lord
god keep us from such a meeting why john
we could not ever fly flye jann
yes my lord we should try in vain
we would fight to the death of course but afterward that
think of lad glenarvan think of mary grant
well halley is a brute but i am keeping my eyes open and if the coast looks dangerous i will put the ships had to see again
so that on that score there is little or no danger
but as the getting alongside the duncan god for bed
they were not to leave it again till the tops of the wa hey ranges were lit for the first fires of day
they had one night in which to prepare for death
the meal ended
sleep which keeps all sorrow in abeyance soon way down their eyelids they slept in each other's arms overcome by exhaustion and prolonged watching
if it is decree that we die to morrow let us die bravely like christian men ready to appear without terror before the supreme judge
gods who reads our hearts knows that we had a noble end in view
glenarvan's voice firm till now faltered
john you have promised mary what i promise lady hela what is your plan
i believe said john that in the sight of god i have a right to fulfill that promise
my lord whichever of us survives the others will fulfill the wish of lady helena and mary grant
at last the majors said my friends keep that to the last moment
the jailer may forget that he is on guard the prisoner never forgets that he is guarded

wilson and o bennett joined their companions in all united to dig through the wall john with his dagger the others with stones taken from the ground or with their nails while matty stretched along the grounds watched the native guard to a crevice of the mattie
what could be the act
d they knowe of the existence of the prisoners or was a some private enterprise that let to the undertaking
their fingers bled but still they worked down after half an hour they had gone three feet deep they proceeded by the increased sharpness of the sounds that only a thin lair of earths prevented immediate communication
the john mangles inserting blade of it pon yard avoided the knife which now protruded above the soil but seized the hand that wed of it
but softly as the name was breathe mary grand already awakened by the sounds of the hut slipped over towards glenarvan and seizing the hand all stained with earths she covered it with kisses
watch the savages outside said robert
round his body was rolled in long coil a flax rope

and so though many questions and many experiments they learned at last how to use a contents of this one storehouse

here is something different rounded like a nut shell you can split off one side and behold there is the not lies snugly as does any test nut in its fur
ferns and palms mosses in trees in animals all perfects all beautiful and yet all hidden away under this hill and turned into shining black coal now i can veryain well remember when i first saw a coal fire in how i've it look to see what seemed to be burning stones
for when i was little girl we always logs a wood blazing in an open fireplace and so did many other people and coal was just coming into use for fewe
what should we have done if everybody had cept un burning wood to this day
these forest were of trees different in some ways from those we have now great ferns as tallest this house and motes as high if little trees and palm leaves of enormous size
then the hills were piled up on tops of it all but here and there some edge of a coal bed was tilted up and appeared above the ground
but by and by the wise men thought about it and said themselves we must find out what useful purpose god mad the gas for we knows that he does not make anything for harms only
it was only a trouble to the gas makers who had no use for it and evening threw it away until some one more thoughtful than the others found out that water would not pass through it
don't you see how many uses we have found for this refuse col car

one who rites of such an ear a labors under a troublesome disadvantage
in the present case that disadvantage is doubled for while the sins of the church however heinous were still such as admit of being expressed in words this s ends of the heathen world against which she fought were utterly indescribable and the christian apologists is thus compelled for the sake of decency to state the church's case far more weakly than the facts deserve
not be it ever remembered that the slightest suspicions of immorality attaches either to the her one of this book or to the leading philosophers of her school for several centuries
that divine words who is the light who lighted every man which cometh into the worlds hadow awakened in the heart of mankind a moral craving never before felt in any strength except by a few isolated philosophers or prophets
the very revery emperors had arrayed themselves on her side
julians last attempt to restore paganism by imperial influence had only proved that the old faith had lost all hold upon the hearts of the masses had his death the great tide wave of new opinions rolled on unchecked and the rulers of earth were feigned to swim with the stream to accept in words at least the church's laws as their to acknowledge a king of kings to whom even they owed omai ince and to call their own slaves they poorer brethren and often too their spiritual superiors

they brought before the minds of churchmen a thousand new questions which must be solved unless the church was to relinquish forever her claims as the great teacher and satisfy of the human soul
but the health of a church depends not merely on the creed which had professes not evening on the wisdom and holiness of a few great ecclesiastics but on the faith and virtue of its individual members

how iniquitous was the conducted of the sons of theodosius in refusing the usual bounty by which the goths were bribed not to attack the empire the whole pent up deluge burst over the plains of italy and the western empire became from that day forth a dying idiot while the new invaders divided europe among themselves
the countless treasures which five centuries of rapine had accumulated around the capital had become the prey of men clothed in sheepskins and hors hide and the sister of an emperors had found her beauty virtue and pride of race worthily matched by those of the hard handed northern hero who led her away from italy as his captive and his bride to found new kingdoms in sou france and spain and to drive the newly arrived vandals across the straits of gibraltar into the then blooming coast land northern africa

to be welcomed into the celestial ranks of the heroic to rise to the immortal gods to the ineffable powers onwards upward ever through ages and through eternities till i find my home at last and vanish and the glory of the nameless and the absolute one
i to believe against the authority of porphyry himself too in evil ee and magic
hot do wh care for foods
how can he whose spar lies above the stars stoop every moments to earth
ay she answered half bitterly and would that we could live without food and imitate perfectly the immortal gods
there is fruit with lenses and rice waiting for you in the next room and bread unless despise it too much
strange that men should be content to grovel and to be men when they might rise to the rank of gods
not that such a creature as is that disturbs me no created thing i hope can move my equanimity but if i could stoop to hate i should hate her hate her
and her voice took a tone which made it somewhat uncertain weather in spite of all the lofty impassibility which she felt bound to possess she did not hate pelagia with a most human and mundane hatred
his excellency madam the prefects
and why should that disturb me let him enter
shasta rambles and modo memories
arctic beauty and desolations with their blessings and dangers only m be found here to test the endurance and skill of adventurous climbers but far better than climbing the mountain is going around its warmed fertile base enjoying its bounties like a bee circling around of bank of flowers
perhaps the profession of doing goode may be full but everybody should be kind at least to himself
go quietly alone no harmon befall you
but it is far better to go a foot
one blanket will be enough to carry or you may forego the pleasure in burden altogether as would for fires as everywhere abundant
only a little food will be required
thus one saunters on and on in the glorious radiance and utter peace and forgetfulness of time
yet strange to say there are days even here somewhat dull looking when the mountain seems uncommunicative sending out no appreciable invitation as if not at home
at such time its height seems much less as if crouching and weary it were taking rest
everye crystal dances responsive to the touches of the sun and the currents of sap in the growing cells of all the vegetation are ever in a vital worl and rush and though many feet in wings are folded how many are astir
slight rain storms are likely to be encountered in a trip brown the mountain but one may easily find shelter beneath well fetched trees that shed the rain like a roof
then the shining of the wet leaves is delightful and the steamy fragrance and the burst of birds song from the multitude of thrushes and finches and warblers that have nests in the chapparal
a thousand thousand voices are heard but so finely blended they seem a park of the night itself and make a deeper silence
and setting out from strawberry valley by bearing off to the northwestward a few miles you may see
in approaching it it suspicious looking yellow spotted hoodoo and watchful attitude will be likely to make you go cautiously through the bog where it stands as if you were approaching and dangerous snake
it is lined with ember algy and mosses and shaded with alder willow and thorn bushes which give it a fine setting
it is three or four miles long and terminates at an elevations of about nine thousand five hundreds feet above sea level in moraine sprinkled ice cliffs sixty feet high
the long grace slopes leading up to the glacier seemed remarkably smooth and unbroken
most of the drainage of the glacier vanishes at once in the poorest rocks to appear and springs and the distant valley and it is only in time of floods that the channel carries much water then there are several fine falls in the gorge six hundreds feet or more in height
chasing this wild changing channel gorge gi your canyon the sections will show mount shasta as a huge palamedes containing the records layer upon lir of strange contrasted events in its fiery i see history
regaining the lowe ground at the base of the mountain and holding on in your grand or it you pass her a belt of juniper woods called the cedars to sheep rugg at the foot of the shasta pass
here he strike the old emigrant road which leads over the low divide to the eastern slopes of the mountain
m bremer as the most noted stronghold of the sheep and the whole chaster region
large flocks dwell here from year year winter and summer descending occasionally into the adjacent sage plans in lava beds to feed but ever ready to take refuge in the jagged crags of their mountain and every alarm
while travelling with a company of hunters i saw about fifty in one flock
the meal deer are nearly as heavy the
their long massive ears give them a very striking a parents
b neither the glorified woods on the one hand nor the lake on the others could it first hold the eye
then fell the gloaming making everything still more forbidding in mysterious
then darkness like death
two or three miles farther on as the main stronghold of the modoc held by d so long and defiantly against all the soldiers that could be brought to the attack
the ducks less weary kept their places merely swimming in out through openings in the rushes rippling the glassy water and raising spangles in their wake
they are brought rugged crevassed cloud like masses of down grinding ice pouring forth streams of muddy water as measures of the work they are doing and sculptural the rocks beneath them very unlike the long majestic glaciers of alaska that river like go winding down the valleys through the forests to the sea
thus the caster river issues from a large lake like springing and casta valley and about two thirds of the volume of the m cloud gushes forth in a grand springing on the east side of the mountain a few miles back from its immediate base
should the volume of the stream where you strike it seemed small then you will know that you are above the springing if large nearly equal to its volume at its confluence with the pit river than you are below it and in either case have only to fallow the river up or down until you come to it
under certain conditions you may hear the roar of the water rushing from the rock at distance of half a mile or even more or you may not hear it until within a few rods
the vivid green of the boulders beneath the water is veryain striking and colors the entire stream with the exceptions of the portions broken into fun
a asplenium it blob mum who cher hazel dogwood and alder make a luxurious fringe and setting and the forests of douglas bruce along the banks are the finest i have ever seen in the sierra
tracing rivers to their fountains makes the most charming of travels
as the life blooded of the landscapes the best of the wilderness comes to their banks and not one dull passages found in all their eventful histories
tracing them a cloud to its highest springs and over the divided to the fountains of fall river near fort crook bents down that river to its confluence with the pit on from there to the volcanic region about lessons beaut through the big meadows among the sources of the feather river and downed through forests of sugar pine to the fertile plans of chico this is a glorious saunter and imposes no hardship
the ascent of lessons bee is an easy walk and a views from the summit are extremely telling
the lofty icy shasta towering high above all seems but an hours walk from you though the distance in an airline is about sixty miles
the big meadows lie near the foot of lessons beaut a beautiful spacious basin set in the heart of the richly forced mountains scarcely surpassed in the grandeur of its surroundings by too
the great wilds of our country once held to be boundless and inexhaustible are being rapidly invaded and overrun in everye direction and everything destructible in them as being destroyed
every landscape low and high seems doom to be trampled and harried
when we took our seats at the breakfast table it was with the feeling of being no longer looked upon as connected in anyway with this case
instantly they absorbed all my attentions though i dared not give them a directed look and continued to observe them only in the glass
yes and a veryain respectable one
the lady is not the mothers of the boys but their aunt
the boys belong to the gentleman who is a widower
george nodded
the boy s look quite awake enough if father does not
do they still insist that miss challoner was the only person in the room with them at this time
gorge
have you ever thought that she might have been a suicide
i know it sounds foolish but the alternative is so improbable
the boys look quite awake enough but who can tell i would sooner believe that
a man was looking in from the corridor behind at the four persons we were just discussing
i enquired of george with my eyes still on this furtive watcher
i took quite fancy to him why
i am looking at him now
just in everyday detective but ambitious i suppose and quite alive to the importance of being thorough
yes hes more core in all his movements
what does he want
i asked as soon as george had returned to my side
he wants me to stand ready to obey any sums the police may sent me
i emphasized complacently
he appeared to know for he tolde me at once that he was detective gr a man who had grown old in solving just such baffling problems as these
he gave up work sometime ago i have been told my husband went on but evenly a great case still has its learn meant for him
the trail here must be a veryain blind one for them to call him in
i wish we had not left social
he was late of course but when he did appear i almost forgot our usual greeting in my hurry to ask him if he had seen the evening papers
however a little later we had a comfortable chat
it was one which gave me a small triumph over george
the suggestions he had laughed at was not so entirely foolish as he had been pleased to considerate
their greeting was cordial and the lines on the latter's face relaxed a little as he met the still bright eye of the man upon whose instincts and judgment so much reliance had always been placed
this is veryain good of you he began glancing down of the aged detective s bundled up b legs and gently pushing a chair towards him
it's the most inexplicable there
but clues there are absolutely none
that is we have not been able to find any perhaps you can
at least that is what we hope
its a case in a thousand gryce
the old man's eyes shot fire and unconsciously one foot slipped to the floor
she had no companions near her
no word no cry just a collapse and sudden fall
in olden days they would have said struck by a bolt from heavens
what do you make of it gryce
i should like to see the desks you speaker of and the spot where she fell
a young fellow who had been hovering in the background that once stepped forwards
he was the plain faced detective who had spoken to george
this sweetwater as they called him was i have since understood one of his proteges and more or less of favorite
then over the grounds study to the affair carefully
veryain well then your ino positions to pre near me
well well that's honest at all events
but i am in no positions to make promises
old days don't return for the asking
whether he got anything else it would be impossible to say from his manner as he finally sank into a chair by one of the openings and looked down on the lobby below
what are or two of the musicians from the end of the hall
naturally they reached her first
mark sour be and clouds hen burg
honest germans men who have played here for years
who came next on the scene some people from the lobby
anybody before the father came in
yes miss clark the middle aged lady with the parishes
i suppose she has been carefully questioned perry i should say
and she speaks of no weapon
not till the doctor came her doctor was happily in his office in this veryain building
yes mister slater the insist of manager who was a the lobby at the time says that ten minutes at least must have elapsed
no doubt
sweetwater someone drew th ween out
but not altogether by me
wherever she pleases only i can't walk far
it has not been running since last night or it would be full of curious people all the time hustling to get a glimpse of this place
but though put a man on for you
veryain goods managed as you will
i'll w tear till you're ready explain yourself to the lady tell her i'm an olde and romantic invalid who has been used to asking his own questions
as her quite figure appeared in the doorway sweet water stole a glance at mister gryce
there was no doubting them in this instance
yes
for some little time that is it seemed long though i believe it was not more than a minute before two men came running from the musicians gallery
yes many times
what made the difference
miss clarks started and her sweet face showed a moment's perplexity did i she queried musingly
no a veryain natural one i will should say
and the glance she cast him while not meeting his eyes showed that she understood the importance of the admission
i knowl she said what you are going to ask me now
there was no pared in the wound
the time narrowed down to one and in that one miss clark was the only person to touch her
i will trouble you no further
sweetwater heal me out of this
but vigor returned to him before he had well reached the door and he showed some of his bold spirit f he thanked miss clark and turned to take the elevator
the next minute she was in this lady's arms
no weapon protruded from the world nor was any found on or near her a in the mezzanine what follows
she struck the blow herself and the strength of purpose which led her to do this gave her the additional force to pull the weapon out and fling it from her
it did not fall upon the floor around her therefore it flew through one of those openings into the lobby and there it either will be or husband fou
with education which of to have insured me an honourable standing in the worlds with some intelligence wit good literary and scientific knowledge and endowed with those accidental physical qualities which are such a good passport into society i found myself at the age of twenty the mean follower of a sublime art in which if great talent is rightly admired mediocrity is as rightly despised
i was compelled by poverty to become a member of a musical band in which i could expects neither esteem nor considerations and i was well aware that i should be the laughing stock of the persons who had known me as a doctor in divinity as ancles stick and as an officer in the army and had welcomed me in the highest society
i felt that in my first profession as i was not blessed with the vocation necessary to it i should have succeeded only by din of hypocrisy and i should have been despicable in my own estimation even if i had seen the purple mantle on my shoulders for the greatest dignities cannot silence a man's own conscious
besides i was of opinions that a man's profession whatever it might be ought to supply him with enough money to satisfy all his once and the very poor pay of an officer would never have been sufficient to cover my expenses because my education had given me greater once than those of officers in generals
o scandalous proceedings often exposed us to the greatest danger
we would very often spend the whole night rambling about the city inventing and carrying int execution the most impertinent practical jokes
we did the same with physicians whom we often sent half dressed to some nobleman who was enjoying excellent health
whenever we could contrive to get into a church tower we thought a great fund to frightened all the perish by ringing the alarm bell is if some fire had broken out but that was not all we always cut the bell ropes so that in the morning the churchwardens had no beans of summoning the faithful to early mass
this is the amusing adventure which closed our exploits
in everyone of the seventy two perishes of the city of venice there is a large publick house caught magazine
yet there are a few private rooms which contain a tables surrounded with benches in which a respectable family or a few friends can enjoy themselves in the decently lay
the waiter of the magazine came to be paid and our chiefs gave him what was due enjoining silence under penalty of death
we took our three prisoners to a large bow
whereas is my husbands
they were fear you shall see him again to morrow
my readers may imagine whether we felt inclined to laughs when the charming creature bade us goodnight thinking us all with perfected good faith
two days afterwards are nocturnal orgy began to be talked of
and went o to say that the two men who had carried her off had taken her to such a place where they had and hour later been met by the other six and that they had all repaired to the two swords where they had spent an hour and drinking
there was no cowardly traitor amongst us although we were all poor but fear had its effects and our nocturnal pranks were not renewed
i picked it up in coming up to him just as he was going down the steps i handed it to him
i told him and he insisted upon my coming with him in the gondola saying that he would leave me at my house
i rubbed it with all my strength but he told me in a sort of indistinct whisper that the numbness was spreading all along the left side and that he was dying
i jog out of the gand dollah and fought myself on the veryain spot where three years before i had talked rhea such a forcible lesson i inquired for his a surgeon at the first coffee house and ran to the house that was pointed out to me
taking everything upon myself i ordered a servant to hurry out for a physician who came in a short time and ordered the patient to be blood again thus approving the first bleeding prescribed by me
thinking i had the right to watch the sick man i settled myself near his bed to give him every care he required
it did not know who i was and d not like to ask me whilst i thought it better to preserve a modest silence
he had gambolled and lost a great deal and his brother was as most bitter enemy because he was infatuated with the idea that he had tried to poison him
the physician who attended him was named terror he thought by some peculiar train of reasoning that he could cure him by applying and me curio ointment to the chest to which no one raised any objection
delighted with such a fortunate result we lay down again
he entreated me to tell him the truth
what extraordinary things will sometimes occur from mere chance or from the force of circumstances
unwilling to hurt his vanity by telling him that he was mistaken i took the wild resolution of informing him in the presence of his two friends that i possessed a certain numeral calculus which gave answers also in numbers to any questions i like to put
i obeyed implicitly and met your excellency
the three fads were astounded
i declared myself quite willing for it was necessary to brazen it out after having ventured as far as i had done
he wrote the questions and gave it to me i read it i could not understand either the subject or the meeting of the words but it did not matter i had to give an answer
if the question was so obscurer that i couldn make out the sense of it it was natural that i should not understand the answer
they all l ask me how long i would require to teach them the rules of my sublime couples
not veryain long i answered and i will teach you as you wish although the hermit assured me that i would die suddenly within three days if i communicated my science to anyone but i have no faith whatever in that prediction
they believe that through me they possessed the philosophers stone the universal panacea the intercourse with all the elementary heavenly and infernal spirits and they had no doubt whatever that thanks to my sublime science they could find out the secrets of every government in europe
but although believing fully in my oracles they were too kind hearted to think them the work of the double and en suited their natural goodness better to believe my answers inspired by some heavenly spirits
they were not only good christians and faithful to the church but even real devotees and full of scruples
as for the eucharist trans substantiation the real presence it was all no mystery to them but palpable evidence and yet they were not jesuits
i might be told that if i had wished to follow the rules of pure morality i aught either to have declined intimate intercourse with them or to have undeceived them
besides i found it very avery flattering to my vanity to become the subject of the speck live chattering of empty fools who having nothing os to do and always trying to find out the cause of everye moral phenomena they ma with which their narrow intellect cannot understand
whoever you may be i am indebted to you for my life
your apartment is ready you may send your clothes you shall have a servant a gondola at your orders my own table in ten sequins a month
you needed not think of the future think only of enjoying yourself and take me as your adviser in everything that may happen to you in everything you may wish to undertake and you may be certain of always finding me your friend
i threw myself at his feet to assure him of my gratitude and embraced him calling him my fathers
sir edwards not wholly discouraged by the denial with which dora forth had with delicacy acquainted him still hoped for a kind receptions and was so often at the house of missus horton that lord frederick's jealousy was excited and the tortures he suffered in consequence convinced him beyond a doubt of the sincerity of his affection
everye time he beheld the object of his passionate for he still continued his visits though not so frequently as hereof he pleaded his cause with such ardor that miss woodley who was sometimes present and ever compassionate could not resist wishing him success
yet did the watchful miss woodley often times here a sigh escape from her unknown to herself till she was reminded of it and then a sudden blush would instantly over spread her face
night after night his sleep had been disturbed by farce for her when abroad morning after morning it had been broken by the clamour of her return
i hope miss milner you pass this evening at home'
i thought miss milner you gave me your wor that you would pass this evening at home
yes indeed and i believe it is right that i should keep my first promise is it not
missus horton rose from her seat moved the decanters and fruit round the tablet stirred the fire and came back to her seat again before another word was uttered
nor had this good woman's officious labors taken the least from the awkwardness of the silence which as soon as the bustle she had made was over returned in its full force
miss milner you shall not leave the house this evening sir
and he walked immediately out of the apartment by another door
her hand fell motionless from that which she held she appeared motionless herself till missus horton beseeching her not to be uneasy at the treatment she had received made her tears flow as if her heart was breaking
it was not from any real cause of grief that she wept but there was a magnetic quality and tears which always attracted hers
do you think i would go answered miss milner with an eagerness that for a time suppressed her tears in contradiction to his will
if you think so madam i seen nothing that should prevent me now
niece i command you not to stir out of the room this evenings
miss woodley obediently sat down and though her thoughts and heart were in the chamber of her friend she never marked by one impertinent word or by one line of her face the restraint she suffered
at the usual hour mister dor four and his ward were summoned to tea he entered with a countenance which evinced the remains of anger his eye gave testimony of his absent thoughts and though he took up a pamphlet affecting to read it was plain to discern that he scarcely knew he held it in his hand
miss woodley thought it her duty to be mute and now the jingle of a teaspoon was like a deep tone bell all was so quiet
missus horton two in the self approving reflection that she was not in a quarrel or altercation of any kind felt herself at this moment remarkably peaceful and charitable
miss woodley did not recollect herself so but was so in reality in her a peas and charity were instinctive virtues accident could not increase them
he coughed drank his tea endeavour to talk but found it difficult sometimes red and in this manner near two hours were passed away when miss milner came into the room not dressed for a ball but as she had risen from dinner
dora for redd on and seemed afraid of looking up lest he should see what he could not have pardoned
after a few minutes pause and some little embarrassment on a part of missus horton at the disappointment she had to encounter from this unexpected dutiful conducts she asked miss milner if she would now have any tea
dora forth then laid the book out of his hand and by the time the servant had left the room thus began
it is often the ungrateful task of a friend to be troublesome sometimes unmannerly
forgive the duties of my office and believe that no one is half so much concerned if it robs you have any degree of happiness as i myself m
what he said he looked with so much sincerity that had she been burning with rage at his late behaviour she must have forgiven him for the regret which he so forcibly expressed
she was going to reply but found she could not without accompanying her words with tears therefore after the first attempt she desisted
on this he rose from his chair and going to her said once more show your submission by obeying me a second time today
keep your appointment and be assured that i shall issue my commands with more circumspection for the future as i find how strictly they are complied with
in the last communications which he had received from lady milburgh she had scolded him in terms that were for her severe because he had not returned to his wife and taken her off with him to naples
and now had come to pass that his soul remaining ally mister samuel basle the x policeman was becoming weary of his service
at last he sent wor to say that he himself would be in england before the end of march and would see that the majesty at the law should be vindicated in his favor
in making this he had expected no success though from the energetic nature of his disposition he had made the attempt with some zeal
missus basle was disposed to think that ladies of quality among whom madam tea was entitled in her estimation to take rank were seldom better than they ought to be and she was quite willing that her husband should earn his bread by watching the lady or the lady's lover
and had the case been brought before the judge ordinary by means of her husband's exertions she would have taken pleasure in reading everye word of the evidence even though her husband should have been ever so roughly handled by the lawyers
a distinct promise of a hundreds pounds was made to him if you would have the childs ready to hand overt travelin on tra villain's arrival in england
of course it ain't said missus ble
the paternal parent has a right to his infants no doubt that was basil's law
he can't suckle him canny
when a married woman has followers and the husband don't go the wrong side of the post too or it ain't proved again him that he do they'll never let her have nothing to do with the children
i'll tell you what it is be exclaimed missus basle it's my believe as he ain't quite right up here and missus bos touched her forehead
drat him all what is it they once they don't know what they wants
it's that is makes em i won't say what
but as for this year childs
trevanion had followed his letter quicker than he had intended when it was written and was now with his prime minister before his prime minister had been able to take any action on the last instruction received
does one mister samuel basle live here asked trevanion
then basle came forward and introduced his wife
but trevanion was of a different opinions and he was disgusted and revolted most unreasonably by the appearance of his minister's domestic arrangements
basle had always waited upon him with a decent coat and a well brushed hat and clean shoes
it is veryain much easier for such men as mister basle to carry decency of appearance about with them than to keep it at home
perhaps you could put on your coat and walk out with me for a few minutes said turban
missus basle who well understood that business was business and that wives were not business felt no anger at this and handed her husband his best coat
basle away from his own home out on business with his coat buttoned over his breast and his best half in his hand was aware that he commanded respects and he could carry himself accordingly
i do not suppose that anybody will question my right to have the care of my own childs said trevanion
if you wouldn have gone to mister skin sir suggested ble
as he went about his eyes were ever cast downwards and he walked with a quick shuffling gate and he suspected others feeling that he himself was suspected
and all works had ceased with him
he's up into an ser a minding of his parliamentary duties
i've watched as sharp as watching can go pretty near
but if you ask me my opinions why in course they've been to gethers somewhere
and basle as he said this smiled almost aloud
and he did go away leaving basle standing in the middle of stony walk
master and man dismounted from their beasts and as soon as they had settled themselves at the foot of the trees sancho who had had a good noontime meal that day let himselfe without mor ado pasted the gates of sleep
the don quixote whom his thoughts far more than hunger kept awake could not close an i e and roan in fancy to and fro through all sorts of places
at one moment it seemed to him that he was in the cave of multi sins and saw dulcinea transformed into a country wench skipping and mounting upon her she ass again that the words of the sage merlin were sounding in his ears setting forth the conditions to be observed and the exertions to be made for the disenchantment of dulcinea
who is stating me and using me
dulcinea is perishing thou art living on regardless i am dying of hope deferred therefore untruss thyself with a good will for mine it is here in this retired spot to givee at least two thousand glashes
seeing this sancho got up and grappling with his master he gripped him with all his might in his arms giving him a trip with the heel stretched him on the ground on his back and pressing his right me on his chest held his hands in his own so that he could neither move nor breathed
how no trick exclaimed don't g day
just thou revolt against dy master and natural lord
dost thou rise against him who gives thee his bread
don quixote gave his promise and swore by the life of his thoughts not to touch so much as a hair of his garments and to leave him entirely free and to his own discretion to whip himself whenever he pleased
sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot but as he was about to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touches his head and putting up his hands encountered somebody's two feet with shoes and stockings on them
he trembled with fear and made for another tree where the veryain same thing happened to him and he fell a shouting calling upon don quixote to come and protect him
dont quixote did so and ask him what had happened to him and what he was afraid of
sono replied that all the trees were full of men's feet and legs
don quixote was on foot with his horse unbridled and his lance leaning against a tree and in short completely defenceless he thought it best therefore to fold his arms and thou his head and reserve himself for a more favourable occasions and opportunity
he was mounted upon a powerful horse and had on a coat of mail with four of the pistols they called patrols in that country at his waist
he saw that his squires for so they call those who follow that trade were about to rifle sancho panza but he ordered them to desist and was at once obeyed so the girdle escaped
he saw me he paid court me i listen to him and unknown my fathers high loft him for there is no woman however secluded she may live war close she may be kept who will not have opportunities e despair for following her head long impulses
in a word he pledged himself to be mine and i promised to be his without carrying matters in he further
give me my horse and arms and wait from me here i will go inquest of this night and dead her alive i will make him keep his word plighted to so great beauty
nobody need have any doubt about that said sancho for my master has a veryain happy knack of mat making it's not many days since he forced another man to marry who in the same way backed out of his promisest to another maiden and if it had not been for his persecutors the enchanters changing the man's proper shape into a lackeys the said maiden would not be w this minute
they made haste to overtake them which as the party moved slowly they were able to do with these
the wounded gentleman opened his all but closed eyes and recognizing claudia said i see clearly there and mistaken lady that it is thou that he slam me a punishment not merited or deserved by my feelings towards thee for never did i mean to nor could i wrongly in thought ordee
it is not true then said claudia that thou were going this morning to marry leonora the daughter of the rich b vestal
on perceiving this claudia when she had convinced herself that her beloved husband was no more rent the air with her size and made the heaven's ringing with her lamentations she tore her hair and scattered it to the winds she beat her face with her hands and showed all the signs of grief and sorrow that could be conceived to come from an afflicted heart
cruel reckless woman she cried howe easily wor thou moved to carry out a thoughts a wicked
o husband whose unhappy fate in being mine hath borne me from the baraboo the grave
the servants wept cloy is swooned away again and again and the whole place seemed a field of sorrow and an a abode of misfortune
claudia told him she meant to go to a monastery of which an an of hers was abase where she intended to pass her life with a better and everlasting spouse
claudia would not on any account allow him to accompany her and thanking him for his offers as well as she could took leave of him in tears
sancho said they had but that three kerchiefs that were were three cities were missing
what are you talking about man
said one of the bystanders i have got them and they are not worth three reels
at this instant one or two of those squires who were posted a sentinels on the roads to watch you who came along them and report what passed to their chiefs came up and said signor there is a great thrup of people not far off coming along the road to barcelona
what led me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance which is strong enough to disturbed the quietest hearts
and if you have any desire to shorten the journey and put yourself easily in way of salvation come with me and i will show you how to become a night errant a calling wherein so many hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken his penances they will lodge you in heavens in a trice
and now the squires despatched to make the prize came up bringing with them two gentlemen on horseback two pilgrims on foot and a coach ful of women with some six servants on foot and on horseback and attendants on them and a couple of mule tears whom the gentleman had with them
the captain showed plainly the concerned they felt the regions lady was downcast and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their property confiscated
the regent's lady ordered one of her servants to give the eighty grounds that had been assess as ser share at once for the captains had already paid down their sixty
one of the squires observed in his mixture of gascon and clean this captain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman if he wants to be so generous another time let it be with his own property and not hours
they were all taken aback and not one of them dared to utter a word such deference did they pay him
he had been a clerk in a banking house and was transported form blent though by some grave doubts as to his guilt were entertained
when the muster bell rang in that gang broke up rufus daws on his silent way to his separate cell observed a notable change of custom in the disposition of the new convict
i'm not to go in there says the ex bank clerk drawing back and dismayed from the cloud of fl faces which lowered upon him
what is he more than anybody else said the wretched man to himself as he hugged his misery close
about dawn the next morning mister north who amongst other vagaries not approved of by his bishop had a habit of prowling about the prison that un official hours was attracted by a dispute at the door of the dormitory
a prisoner refractory your reverence said the watchman
wants to come out mister north
kirkland ghastly pale bleeding with his woolen shirt torn and his blue eyes wight open with terror was clinging to the bars
and beat on the bars with white and sweating hands
i order you sir north cried indignant
veryain sorry your reverence but your reverence knows that i daren't do such a thing
o you ministers of christ wolves and sheeps clothing you shall be judged for this
let him out cried north again stamping his foot
there's more trouble with you bloody aristocrats than enough lie quiet
you can guess what that unhappy boy has suffered
impertinent young beggar said burgs

he had hardly uttered the words when the boys flung himself beneath the long
hold on to me miss nancy said the giant i'm bigg enough to carry double
but carling kept steadily on for the river
just as he reached it however the figure of mister north rose from behind a pile of stones
kirkland jumped for the jetty missed his footing and fell into the arms of the chaplain
i'll mister north says kirkland why did you stop me

in fact the ringing leader john wrecks gave me his confession and i sent it to the bishop
a great rascal putt north
well now said meek and with asperity i don't agree with you
he seems to me to be truly penitent for his offenses a misguided but not a hypocritical man if my knowledge of human nature goes for anything i hope he is said north
there's no fear of him said burgs cheerily if he grows uproarious we'll soon give him a touch of the cat
i suppose severity is necessary returned beacon though to my ears a flogging sounds a little distasteful
i have these attacks at times
the reverend macon eyed his clerical brother with poor the reverend macon was not accustomed to clergyman war black neckties smoke clay pipes jude tobacco and drank neat brandy out of tumblers
so they went onto the veranda and looked down upon the lights of the prison and listened to the sea lapping the shore
by and by a short figure smoking a sit came of the dark and proved to be doctor macaw who had been prevented from attending the dinner by reason of an accident to a constable at norfolk bay which had claimed his professional attention
dead said doctor machine
delighted to see you mister meek
but macao wane was tired and wanted to get home
our roads lie together doctor
before the two clergyman had got halfway down the steep path that led from the commandants house to the flat on which the cottages of the doctor and chaplain were built mack away rejoined them
another flogging to morrow said he grumblingly
whom is he going to flog now
you don't meaning to say he's going to flog kirkland
perhaps youll have the goodness to allow me to be the best judge of that returned macaw inne drying up as little body to its least insignificant stature
mister meek and expressed some alarms but doctor macaw inne reassured him
we can't do anything without evidence complain
i shall find my port mont in my room you said yes yes
he sleeps at the back and north hurried off
an impulsive gentleman said macon to mac awe as a sounds of mister north's footsteps died away in the distance
bacco wine shook his head seriously
he is the strangest fits at times
unless it's a cans are in the stomach i don't know what it can be cancer and the stomach
doctor we all have a crosses every we not
how delightful the grass smells
goodnight sir i hope you will be comfortable
i'll teach my prisoners to attempts to aside
that's mac awe's business
then don't you interfere with me sir
i've given my order sir
then captain burgs cried north is pale face flushing i tell you the boy's blood will be on your head
i am a minister of gods sir and i forbid you to commit this crime
damn your impertinent sir burst out burgs
your dismissed officer of the government sir
this of course was mere bravado and the part of the commandante
north knew well that he would never dare to attempt any such active violence but the insult stung him like the cut of a whip
sh mister north he said and go down to the barracks until stroke the kirkland is to have a hundred lashes to morrow
i'll show you whose master here my good sir
this is murderous
the government may go to and you too roared burgs get out
they shall not flog that boy he said
i'll report this to the government
i wish i hadn't taken that brandy he said fool that i ams
oh god give me strength aid me help me
o lord looked down upon me
he mixed a teaspoon of this in a panic and of water and drank it
it relieved him for a while
it was as though he had reached the crisis of a disease which had been for days gathering force
i must have a teaspoonful he said to allay the craving
twice he paused on the way to the sitting room and twice was he driven on by a power stronger than his will
he smelt the nighty a rome of the spirit
that at all times debasing at this particular time it was infamous that a vice unworthy of any man was doubly sinful in a man of education and a minister of gone in vain
in the midst of his arguments he found himself at the cupboard the bottle at his lips in an attitude that was at once ludicrous and horrible
her meeting with letty was indescribably tender and a days that followed pretty equally divided between her and her brother in nursing the one and loving the others
but even while she enjoyed everye hour of life and be grudged the time given to sleep she felt as if the dream was too beautiful to last and often said
so christie turned a deaf heire to her prophetic soul and gave herself up to the blissful holiday that had come at last
nothing can surprise me now i prepared for anything evened the sight of my quakerish lover dancing a dick
i feel like a boy out of school or rather a man out of prison and must enjoy my liberty in some way
i'm not a talker you know and as the laws of gravitation forbid my soaring aloft anywhere i can only express my joyfully up lifted state of mind by prancing as you call it
i don't want you too i love to see you so young and happy only you are not the old david and i've got to get acquainted with the new one
i hope you'll like him better than the frost bitten old daid you first new and were kind enough to love
mother says i've gone back to the time before we lost letty and i sometimes feel as if i had
in that case you will find me a proud impetuous ambitious fellow christie a towel that suit
excellently i like pride of your sort impetuosity becomes you for you have lant to control it if need be and the ambition is bestest of all
i shall wait for time to show
then they went back to their work little dreaming as they tied roses and twine sim lax frees how near that other chance was how soon they were to be called upon to keep their promise and how well each was to perform the part given them in life and death
to know home in the land did the great trouble's sudden change than the little cottage in the lane
david was sober enough now and went about his work with a grim set to his lips and a spark in his eyes that made the three women look at one another pale with unspoken apprehensions
it is terrible in yet glorious
david held it close in both of his saying gratefully thank you mother then fixing his eyes on the younger yet not dearer women he added with a ringing in his voice that made their hearts answer with a prompt aye aye in spite of love or fear
the boys bless their brave hearts have done nobly but older men are needed now we cannot sacrifice all the gallant lads and we who have more to lose th they must take our turn and tried to do as well
yes david sister and sweetheart answered bravely forgetting in the forever of the moment what heavy consequences god might see fit to su good'
then it will take the garum in the green house off my hands so autumn for a year or longer if i like
he's kind neighbourly man and his boy will take my place about the house and protective you faithfully
i knew you would go i saw you getting rey and i made up my mind to fall
you will let me to it and in return i will marry you whenever you ask me answered christie sealing the promise with a kissed that silenced him
you've something to tell me i see it in your face dear i must go
next evening as missus sterling set alone in the twilight a tall man in ary blue entered quietly stood watching the tranquil figure for a moment then went and knelt down beside it saying with a most un soldierly choke in the voice
the loyal frenzy fell upon the three quiet women and they could not do too much for their country
it would have taken many knapsacks to hold all we gifts showered upon him by his friends and neighbors
finding that la showed little enthusiasm on the subjects she tried to else him by patriotic appeals of various sorts
veryain well said missus wilkins resolutely turn herself if i can't make no impression on his soul i will on his stomach and see how laval work
we can't afford no nice fiddles now when our men are suffering so
he was not as unmoved as he seemed by the general excitement and had felt sundry manly impulses to up and atom him when his comrades in the shop discussed the crisis with ireful brandishing of os and vent pounding of soule leather as if the rebels were under the hammer
to say that the sis rose at once and swallowed the bit hook and all but feebly expresses the justice done to the cakes by that long suffering men
can you remember what heaps he told us and call them poor long suffering creator's names
n ain't it's a trainer added and lizzy
now siny be you satisfied
and the inconsistent woman fell upon his button ney breast weeping copiously
his wife said him with the fat of the land regardless of consequences his children revolved about him li tireless curiosity in wonder his neighbours flocked int to applaud advise and admire everyone treated him with a respects most grateful to his feelings he was an objective interest and with every hour his importance increased so that by night he felt like a commander in chief and bore himself accordingly
then the good sol openly shorted the bergen she had borne so long in secret and bravely trudged on alone
the women dropped their web to lookin liston for his visits were few and short and every instant was precious
they knew what it was without a word missus sterling clasped her hands and bowed her head
now let's be brave and enjoy every minute of it
we will what can i do for your davy asked christie wonderfully supported by the thought that she was going to
as a married woman you will get on better as my wife you will be allowed to come to me if i need you and as my he stopped here for he could not add as my widows you will have my pension to support you
nothing com part us any more not even death for love like os will last forever
not one david that's true love christie
then they stood quite still for a time and in the silence the two hearts talked together in the sweet language no tongue can er
surely i shall if i give you and myself to the cause and i do it gladly though i know that my heart has got to ac as it never has ached yet when my courage fails as it will buy and by and my selfish soul counts the costs of my offering after the excitement is over
david caught the exaltation and gave no further thought to anything but the duty of the hour finding himself stronger and braver her for that long looking to the illuminated face of the woman he loved
the roses are for they remind me of poor helen and the first t work i did with david was arranging flowers like these for a dead baby's little coffin
but i think few bride's dress with a braver happier heart than mine though i do choose this ober wedding gown answered christi smiling again as she took from the half packed trunk her new hospital suit of soft gray wool stuff
mister power is waiting are you ready love quite ready
you young folks take a wedding trip to the greenhouse while we see how well we can get on without you
david and christie went smiling away together and if they shed any tears over the brief happiness no one saw them but the flowers and they lery kept the secrete folded up in their tender hearts
a veryain simple little marriage feast but more love good will and tender wishes adorned the plain tablet than is often found it wedding breakfasts and better than any speech her song was letty s broken whisper that she folded her arms round david empty chair when no one saw her heaven bless and keep and bring him back to us
i watched with quickened bath and proud souls that living wave blue below invite with a steal glitter above as it flowed down the street in a way to join the sea of dauntless hearts that for months had rolled up against the south and e back reddened with the blood of men like these
then she saw david and the regiment became one man to her
i couldn not lovely be so much loved i not honour more
everye elevation of the type man has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always be a society believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worths among human beings and requiring slavery in some form or other
the distinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling cast pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled or among the ruled class the slaves and dependence of all sorts
we truthful ones the nobility in ancient greece called themselves
it is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to men and were only div italy and at a later period applied to actions it is a gross mistake therefore when historians of morals start with questions like why have sympathetic actions been praised
he honors whatever he recognises in himselfe such morality equals self glorification
probably a pessimistic suspicion with regards to the entire situation of man will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together with his situations
here is the seat of the origin of the famous and tithes good and evil power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit being despised
according to slave morality therefore the evil man arouses fear according to master morality it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it while the badman is regarded as the despicable being
everywhere that slave morality games the ascendancy language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the word good and stupid
he will even say for many reasons i can delight in the good opinions of others perhaps because i love and honour them and rejoice in all their joys perhaps also because their good opinions indorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinions perhaps because the good opinions of others evening cases were i do not sher it is useful to me or gives promise of usefulness all this however is not vanity
in fact conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order and its cause the blending of the blood of masters and slaves the original noble and rare impulse of the masters to a sign a value to themselves and to think well of themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but it has at all times an older ampler and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to it and in the phenomenon of vanity this older propensity over masters the younger
the most varied experience teaches if what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists in spite of all gods and men and has hitherto ben victorious these qualities it calls virtues and these virtues alone it develops to maturity
variations whether they be deviations into the higher finer and rarer or deterioration and monstrosities appear suddenly on the scene and the greatest exuberance and splendor the individual dares to be individual and attach himself
at this turning point of history there manifest themselves side by side and often mixt and entangled together a magnificent manifold virgin forests like up growth and up striving a kind of tropical tempo in the rivalry of growth and an extraordinary decay in self destruction owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoism which strive with one another for san and light and can no longer a sign any limit restraint or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality
nothing but new wise nothing but ne house no common formulas any longer misunderstanding and disregarding league with each other decay deterioration and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled the genius of the rays overflowing from all the corne copies of goods simultaneous ness of spring and autumn full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh still exhausted still unwearied corruptions
dangers again present the mothers of morality great danger this time shifted into the individual into the neighbor and friend into the street into their own childe into their own heart into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and volitions
what will a moral philosophers who appear at this time have to preach
this is the problem of race
in our very avery democratic or rather very plebeian age education and culture must be essentially the art of deceiving deceiving with regard to origin with regards to the inherited plemmyrium soul
the noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without questions and also without consciousness of harshness constraint or arbitrariness therein but rather is something that may have its basis in the primary law of things if he sought a designation for it he would say it is justice itself
on this account the people of one nation understand one another better than those belonging to different nations even when they used the same language or rather when people have lived long together under similar conditions of climate soil danger requirement toil their originates therefrom an entity that understands itself namely a nation
the greater the danger the greater is the need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary not to misunderstand one another in danger that is what cannot at all be dispensed within intercourse
also when all loves and friendships one has the experience that nothing of the kinds continues when the discovery has been made that in using the same words one of the two parties has feelings thoughts intuitions wishes or fears different from those of the other
wh ever groups of sensations within a soul awakened most readily begin to speak and give the word of command these decide as to the general order of rank of its values and determine ultimately its list of desirable things
a man's estimates of value betray something of the structure of his soul and wherein it sees its conditions of life its intrinsic needs
profound suffering makes noble it separates one of the most refined forms of disguise is epicurism along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste which take suffering lightly and puts itself on the defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound
the highest instincts for purity places him who is affected with it in the most extraordinary and dangerous isolation as a saint for it is just holiness the highest spiritualization of the instinct in questions
occasionally too the waking call comes too late the chance which gives permission to take actions when their best youth and strength for actions have been used up in sitting still and how many a one just as he sprang up his found with horror that his limbs are been numbed and his spirits or now too heavy
and whoever thou art what is it that now pleases thee
only name at whatever i have i af thee
but you misunderstand him when you complain about it
there must be a sort of repugnance in me to believe anything definite about myself is there perhaps some enigma therein
probably but fortunately nothing from my own teeth perhaps it betrays the species to which i belong but not to myself as it is sufficiently agreeable to me but what has happened to you
i do not know he said hesitatingly perhaps the harpies of flown over my tablet
to suffocate with his memories to him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul and only seldom finds his tableland and his food prepared the danger will always be great nowadays whoever it is extraordinarily so
and to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice politeness
it was about moon when captain waverley entered the straggling village or of rather hamlet of t levy closer which was situated the mansion of the proprietors
the houses seemed miserable in the extreme especially to and i accustomed to the smiley neatness of english cottages
occasionally indeed when such a consummation seemed inevitable a watchful grand with her close captain staff and spindle rushed like a sybil and frenzy out of one of these miserable cells dashed into the middle of the path and snatching up her own charge from amongst the sunburnt loiterers saluted him with a sound cuff and transported him back to his dungeon the little white headed varlets screaming all the while from the very top of his lungs a shilly traveled to the growling remonstrances of the enraged matron
the evil and remedy such as it is still exist but this is remote from our present purpose and is only thrown out for considerations of the collectors under mister dense dog bill
yet the physiognomy of the people when more closely examined was far from exhibiting the indifference of stupidity their features were rough but remarkably intelligent grave but the veryain reverse of stupid and from amongst the young women an artist might have chosen more than one model whose features in form resembled those of minerva
this avenue was straight and of moderate length running between a double rowe a veryain ancient horse chestnuts planted alternately was sick mors which rose to such huge heights and nourished so luxuriantly that their bows completely overarched the broad road beneath
it was one of those effects which of pined her loves to represents and mingled well with the struggling light which found its way between the bows of the shady ark that vaulted the broad green alley
the house which seemed to consist of two or three high narrow and steep roofed buildings projecting from each other at right angles formed one side of the enclosure
it had been built at a period when castles were no longer necessary and when the scottish architects had not yet acquire the art of designing a domestic residence
neither did the front indicate absolute security from danger
stables other offices occupied another side of the square
two battlemented walls one of which face the avenue in the other divided the court from the garden completed the enclosure
this work of art was the wonder of the country ten miles round
the court was spacious well paved and perfectly clean there being probably another entrance behind the stables for removing the litter
everything around appeared solitary and would have been silent but for the continue plashing of the fountain and the whole scene still maintained the monastic illusion which the fancy of waverley had contoured up
chapters thirty three a confidant
mister morton replied the far from making any claim upon his good opinions his only wish and the sole purpose of his visit was to find out the means of deserving it
evil to him that things otherwise said mister morton or who holds church government and ceremonies as the exclusive gage of christian faith their moral virtue
mister morton seemed particularly struck with the account to waverley's visit to donald being ween
when i was a young man like you mister waverley any such hair branded expedition i beg your pardon for the expressions would have had inexpressible charms for me
he certainly possesses talents beyond the rods fear in which he moves and being neither destitute of ambition nor encumbered with scruples he will poly attempt by every means to distinguish himself during the period of these unhappy commotions
mister morton then made a careful memorandum of the various particulars of lab releases in her views with donna old being lean and the other circumstances which he had communicated
he had neither sympathy with my innocence nor with my wretchedness and the petrify accuracy with which he attended everye form of civility while he tortured me by his questions his suspicions and his inferences was as tormenting as the racks of the inquisitions
they held conventicles and the open fields and being treated with great violence in cruelty by the scottish government were than once tok arms during those reins
since that time their numbers have gradually diminished but a good many are still to be found in the western counties and several with the better temper than in seventeen o sevens of now taken arms for government
it had no ornamentation being exceedingly plain in appearance
here said one of their guides as the processions halted before the little stone building is the palace of torment who h our queen
what that little cabin
exclaimed trot a course
did you suppose a palace would be like one of our handsome residences asked the woman evidently surprised
these intruders are veryain peculiar people remarked a man in the crowd
they seem very ivery ignorant poor things said another in reply
the people must way outside for there is no room for them in the palace
so i follow her through the low archway and in a room beyond very simply furnished sat a young girl engaged and darning a pair of pink stockings
she was a beautiful girl of about seventeen years of age not fat like all the rest of the pinkies but slender and well formed according to our own ideas of beauty
her complexion was not a decided pink but a soft rosy tent not much deeper than that of trots skin
what is it quarterly she asked the woman
the queen gazed upon our friends with evident interests
she smiled a little sadly at trot seemed her prove of button bright's opened frank face and was quite surprised because cap'n bill was so much bigger than her own people
are you a giant
perhaps your are trying to rid to kill mee she continued regarding the sailor's face closely
there is nothing majestic about me as you know veryain well
cary do you consider majesty a proper word to use when addressing a queen
evenin america ever body boughs load our president and the blueskins are so fright of their boolooroo that they trample whenever they go near him
but surely that is all wrongs said tomin gravely
therefore i am am mere agent to directed the laws which are the will of the people and i'm only a publick servant obliged constantly to guard the welfare of my subjects
in that case said button bright you're entitle to the best there is to pay for your trouble
if i lived is luxuriously as my people do and had servants and costly gowns the good pinkies would say that their queen had more than they themselves and it would be true
no our way vast
the queen is nothing but the power to execute the laws to a just grievances and to compel order
i have one great privilege
after my death the pink marble statue of me will be set up in the grand court with the statues of the other kings and queens who have ruled this land and all the pinkies and ages to come will honor me as having bent ad just and upright queen that is my rewards
a misfortune of birth placed me here and i cannot escape my fate
it is much more desirable to be a private citizen happy and care free
yes it was wet and sticky all rat agreed the sailor but the big frog helped us and we got through all right
you are not like my people the pinkies and there is no place for you in our country
in all our history you are the first people from outside our borders who have ef stepped a foot in our land
we do not hate you as you say the blueskins do nora we savage or cruel but we do not want you here at i'm really puzzled what to do with you
i'll look in the great book first
the savage philosopher the dual mind
the original attitude of the american indian toward the eternal the great mystery that surrounds and embraces us was as simple as it was exalted
it was silent because all speech is of necessity feeble and imperfect therefore the souls of my ancestors ascend to god in wordless adoration
none might exhort or confess or in anyway metal with the religious experience of anotherin
among a sal men were created sums of god and stood erected conscious of their divinity
that solitary communion with the unseen which was the highest expression of our religious life is partly described in the word banded literally mysterious feeling which has been variously translated fasting and dreaming
the first ben bay or religious retreat marked an epoch in the life of the youths which may be compared to that of confirmation or conversion in the christian experience
knowing that god sets no value upon material things he took within no offerings or sacrifices other than symbolic objects such as paints and tobacco
at the solemn hour of sun rue or sun sat he took up his position overlooking the glories of earth and facing the great mystery and there he remained naked erects silent and motionless exposed to the elements and forces of his arming for a night and a day to two days and knights but rarely longer
when he returned to the camp he must remain at a distance until he had again entered the vapour bath and prepared himself for intercourse with his fellows
it was not then holly from ignorance or in providence that he failed to establish permanent towns and to develop a material civilizations
to the untutored sage the concentration of population was the prolific mother of all evils moral no less than physical
in this ty of prayer there was no beseeching of favor or help
from the sun as the universal father proceeds the quickening principle a nature and in the patient and fitful womb of our mother the earths our hidden embrees plants and men
this is the material or physical prayer
nothing of the marvellous could astonishing as that a beast should speak or the sun standstill
who may condemn his superstition
here's the supreme mystery that is the essence of worship without which there can be no religion and in the presence of this mystery are attitude cannot be vari unlike that of the natural philosopher who beholds with awe the divine in all creation
in his own thought he rose superior tuan he scorn them evening as a lofty spirit absorbed in its stern task rejects the soft beds the luxurious food the pleasure worshipping gallons of the rich neighbor
the historians of the white race admit the the union was never the first to repudiate his oath
he had neither a national arming or an organized church
her attitude and secret meditations must be such as to in still into the receptive soul of the unborn childs the love of the great mystery and the sense of brotherhood with all creation
be ordeal is best met alone where no curious or pitying eyes e bars her where all nature says to you spirit tis love tis love the fulfilling of life
miss wild mother has not only the experience of her mother and grandmother and the accepted rules of her people for a guide but he humbly seeks to learn a lesson from ant's bees spiders beavers and badgers
in due time the child takes of his own accord the attitude of prayer and speaks reverently of the powers
indeed the distinctive work of both grandparents as that of acquainting the youth with the national traditions and beliefs
the family was not only the social unit but also the unit of government
the remoter degrees of kingship were fully recognized and that not as a matter of form only first cousins were known as brother's and sisters the name of cousin constituted of binding claim and o rigid morality for bade marriage between cousins in any known degree or another words within the clan
when she fell the whole race fell with her
before this clam came upon us you could not find anywhere ha your home th that created by the anian woman
his daily devotions were more necessary to him than daily food
whenever in the course of the daily haunt the redd hunter comes upon a scene that is strikingly beautiful or sublime a black thunder clouded with the rainbows glowing arch above the mountains a white waterfall in the heart of the green gorge a vast prairie tinged with the blooded red of sunset he pauses for an instant in the attitude of worship
when he becomes an old man he loves to make a notable efforts to prove his gratitude
he cuts off the choice morsel of the meat and caste into the fire the purest and most ethel element
the hospitality of the wigwams only limited by the institution of war
our honor is the guarantee for his safety so long as hes within the camp
love between men and woman is founded on the mating instinct and as not free from desire and self seeking
but to have a friend and to be true under any in all trials ands the mark of a man
this bond is between man and man as usually formed in early youth and can only be broken by death
reincarnation in the converse of spirits
therefore he courts death in battle on the other hand he would regard it as disgraceful to be killed in a private quarrel
the men black in their faces and widows or breath parents sometimes gash their arms and legs till they are covered with bloods
giving themselves a pole to their grief they are no lor concerned about a e ely possessions and often give away all that they have to the first comers even to their beds in their home
it was prepared by dressing in the finish clothes together with some personal possessions and ornaments wrapped in several robes and finally in a secure covering of rawhide
as a special mark of respect the body of a young woman or warrior was sometimes laid out in state in a new tepee with the usual household articles and evening with a dish of food left beside it not that they supposed the spirit could use the implements or eat the food but merely as a last tribute
if a man were slain in battle it was an old custom the places body against a tree or rock in a sitting positions always s basing the enemy to indicate his undaunted defiance and bravery's death
at every meal time a dis of food was place under it and some person of the same sex and age as the one who was gone must afterwards be invited in to partake of the foods
at the end of a year from the time of death the relies made a public feast and gave away the clothing and other gifts while the lock of her wass interred with prop ceremonies
it is well known that the american indian had somehow developed a colt power and although in the latter days there had been many impostors and allowing for the vanity and weakness of human nature it is fair to assume that there must have been some evening in the old days yet there are well attested instances of remarkable prophecies and anther mystic practice
no doubt many predictions have been coloured to suit a new age and unquestionably false profits bakers and conjurors had become the pests of the tribes during a transition periods
this was carried out to the letter
this was only one of his remarkable prophecies
another famous medicine man was born on the rum river about one hundred and fifty years ago and live to be over a century old
at the age of about seventy five years he saved his band from utter destruction at the hands of their ancestral enemies by suddenly giving warning received in a dream of the approach of a large war party
five years later he repeated the service and again saved his people from awful slaughter
there are many trustworthy men and men of christian faith to vouch for these in similar events occurring as fore told
at another time when i was fourteen years old we had just left fort elless on the a sonora b river and my youngest uncle had selected a fine spot for a night camp
many of the indians believed that one may be borne more than once and there were some o clem to have full knowledge of a former inclination
there was a well known su war prophet who lived in the middle of the last century so that he still remembered by the old men of his band
shiloh
this was the first big battle in which o regiment had ever been engaged
i do not pretend to tell o what command distinguished itself of heroes of blood and wounds of shrieks and groans of brilliants charges of cannon captured et cetera
about daylight on sunday morning chalmers brigade relieved gladdens
as gladden rod by us courier rut up and told him something
on sunday morning a clear beautiful and still day the order was given for the whole army to advance and to attack immediately
we were supporting and alabama brigade
that's right my brave first tennessee give um hail columbia
the fact was kept from the troops
we had the pass over the ground where troops had been fighting all day
i had heard and read of battle fields seen pictures of battlefields of horses and men of canon and wagons all jumbled together while the grounds was strewn with dead and dying and wounded but it must confess that i never realized the pomp and circumstance of the thing called glorious war until i saw this
i had been feeling mean all the morning as if i had stolen a sheep but when they ordered to charge was given i got happy
officers could dot curd the men to keepen line
on monday the tide was reversed
but as i said before reader a private soldier is but an automaton and those nothing of what is going on among the generals and i am only giving the chronicles of little things of events that came under my own observation as i saw them then and remember them now
should you desire to find out more about the battle i refer you to history
about the time he pulled trigger a straight ball from some direction struck him in the side and he fell off dead and his horse becoming frightened galloped off dragging him through the confederate lines
i monday morning i too captured me a mule
it was wise and his own conceit
i frequently thought it would be pleasant to split the difference with that mule and i would gladly have done so if i could have gotten one half of his no
mule did not desire to cross while i was trying to persuade him with a big stick a rock in his ear and of twister on his nose
so he got a large two inch rope tied one end round the mule's neck the other to the casas and ordered the driver to whip up
the rope however was stronger than the mules no and he was finally prevailed upon by the strength of the rope to cross the creek
im my taking the rope off he shook himself and seem to say you think that you are mighty smart folks but you are a ladle too smart
we remained several months but so we were on the tramp again
the federal army was concentrating at nashville there was no rest for the weary
our army stopped at mars borough
from time to time different regiments were sent forwards to do picket duty
the yet picket lines were not a half mile off
i am av that you know the responsibility resting on me
says he i would not trust a sssh on his words oath or bond march i say
i soon found out that he caught sight of the relief on the road and was afraid to shoot i quickly made up my mind
my gun was at my feet and one step would get it
i made a quick glance over my shoulder and grabbed my gun
he divine my motive and fired the ball miss it's aim
i think we must have killed a good many in the old fields because we were firing all the time at the solid line as they advanced upon us
we kept falling back and firing all day and we relieved by another regiment about dark we were joined our regiment
line of battle was formed on the north bank of stones river on the yankee sigh
bade generalship i thought it was christmas
the private gould but he was no generall you see
a called lieutenant colonel friar son's attention to the yankees and he remarked well i don't know whether they are yankees are not but if they are they will come it out of their mighty quick
the yank is marched over the hill out of sight
we were ordered forward to the attack
we were right upon the yankee line on the walkers and turn pipe
we were not twenty yards off from the yankees and they were pouring the hot shot and shells right into our ranks and every man was yelling at the top of his voice seize fire and you are firing on your own men seize firing you were firing on your own men
oakley color bearer of the fourth tense the regiment ran rid up in the midst of the ach line with his colors begging his men to follow
the leaden hailstorms swept them off the fields they fell back and reformed
we were at that time at least a hundred yards in advance of the brigade cheat him all the time calling upon the men to come on
i sawn felt that he was not fighting for glory but that he was fighting for his country because he loved that country and he was willing to give his life for his country and the success of our cause
i thought it had been torn from my shoulder
as i went back to the field hospital i overtook another man walking along
i looked at that it pretty close and i said great god
he was walking along and all at once he dropped down and died without a struggle or a groan
but i could not bear the thought a wearing dead men's shoes
he was stone dead but i dropped at foot quick
before we arrived at the house we saw a body of yankees approaching and as we started to run back they fired upon us
our picket said run in and reported a night attack
advance into tennessee
yank says what are you do and johnny
we passed a rounded lena crossed the chat hu che and travelled back over the same root on which we had made the arduous campaign under joe johnson
outside of these occasional reminders we could see no evidence of the desolation of the track of an invading army
we saw the united states flag flying from the ramparts and thought the yank would probably be asleep or catching l ser may be engaged in a game of seven up
he walked up and says hello boys what is it boss
a yankee ala says knacker
they persuaded eloquently
a man in the well
the voice appeared to be overhead
right before me i saw the long dry grass all bending toward a common setter and i knew that it was an old well and that my comrade had fallen in it
but how to get him ab out was the unsaved problem
the poor fellow stay in that well all night
we looked all around and thought that the coast was clear
i don't like his gun was loud it though because we did not hear the ball whistle
we walked over this floating bridge and soon found ourselves on the tennessee side of tennessee river
we had be for supper that nighte
however pulse to beat and leap and howe every heart did throb with a motions of joy which seemed nearly akin heavens when we received the glad intelligence of our onward march towards the land of promise and of our loved ones
we were inured to privations and hardships had been upon everye march in every battle and every sermonising and every advance and every retreat in every victory in every defeat
he wanted to go by home u tell his wife and children good by and to get his clothes it was no go
but afterwhile jim says gentleman i gaining b maw
you see jim know the law
those old soldiers had long long ago forgotten about that old laws of the long gon passed the gem it treasured it up in his memory low these many years and he thought it would serve him now as that had no doubt frequently done in the past
the third day was reported that the yankees had taken position on the murr is borrow pike
i regiment was sent to the attack it was jim's regiment
he hadn seen anything to shot at but he blazed away he loaded and fired the second time when they were ordered to retreat
but is laughter a synonym of joy
such perfect completeness is not in nature
had gwynplaine when a childs so worthy of attention that his face had been subjected to transmutation why not
according to all appearance industrious manipulates of children had worked upon his face
it seemed evident that a mysterious and probably a cult science which was too surgery what alchemy was to chemistry had chiseled his flesh evidently at a veryain tender age and manufactured his countenance with premeditation
gwynplaine was a mountebank
he showed himself on the platforms
it was gwynplaine's laugh which created the laughter of others yet he did not lu himself
the outside did not depend on the interior
no one could escape from this ricks
all his emotions whatever they might have been augmented his strange vase of joy are to speak more correctly aggravated it
and everlasting laugh
the mains believed the absolute occasionally gives way and it god himself sometimes abdicates for a time so also of the will
the whole of existence resembles a letter modified in the postscript
with this exception went plains laugh was everlasting
the joyous convulsion of laughter was as at tribute pa they submitted to it gladly but almost mechanically
besides we must remember that they had in those times means of putting patience to sleep and of suppressing all suffering only then it was called magic while now it is called an thea
besides this face those who had brought him up had given him the resources of a gist and an athlete
w plain had yellow hair
his hair having probably been died with some corrosive preparation had left it woolly and rough to the touch
its yellow bristles rather amain than ahead of hair covered and concealed a lofty brow evidently made to contain thought
the operations whatever it had been which had deprived his features of harmony and put all their flesh into disorder had had no effects on the bony structure of his head
what true things are told in stories
in gwynplaine's evil thoughts never ripened and he had therefore no remorse
what was this nothing
from sixteen eighty to seventeen o four a great change had taken place
the wheels were all of the same size and high as wagon wheels
this green color had succeeded in drawing attention to the carriage which was known in all the fair grounds as the green box
on the roof from a two painted green like the rest smoke arose
the astonishment with which the villagers regarded this machine was overwhelming
this was the old establishment of ursus its proportions augmented by success and improved from a wretched booth into a theater
unknown people had worked upon his face he on the other hand had worked on his mind and behind this well executed mask he had placed all that he could have thought
the effective his appearance had been surprising
some believed it to be natural others declared it to be artificial and as conjecture was added to reality everywhere at everye cross road on the journey in all the grounds of fairs and fates the crowd ran after gwynplaine
the curiosity of one place exhausted they passed on to another
this fortune had allowed ursus who was the administrator of gwynplaine success to have the chariot of his dreams constructed that is to say a caravan large of de carry it theater and to so science and art in the highways
for these red phoebe and venus that we may conform to english pronunciation
phoebe cooked venus cubs the temple
ursus and how m of charge of each other
this hut in a corner at the back to the right of the door served as bedchamber and dressing room to ursus and gwynplaine
the caravan was divided into three compartments partition from each others
aloft under the arch of the roof contained the scenes and on opening a trap door lamps appeared producing wonders of light
ursus was the poet of these magical representations he wrote the pieces
then i look perhaps like what i ams
this opening looked for all the worlds like a mouth of hill in the words of the itinerant puritan preachers who turned away from it with horror
uses was in everything in the peace in the company in the kitchen in the orchestra
it was established at south work
the dome of saint paul's was a delight to ursus
saint paul is a saint only with extenuating circumstances
he entered heaven only by the artist's door
it might have been ordered for the gen box
it was a theater ready made
against this wall was placed the green box which they were able to draw into the yards owing to the height of the gate
the placard wind plain the laughing man taken from its nail in the green box was hung up close to the sign of the inn
by the side of the door was constructed off hand by means of an empty barrel a box for the money taker who was sometimes phoebe and sometimes pinos
we are in london said ursus we muste be prepared for the gentry
they began their performances
with that exception their success became so great that no mount to bank memory could recall its parallel
all southwark run in crowds to admired the laughing man
the merry andrews and mounted banks of tut ins afield were aghast gwynplaine
gwynplaine ate up their publick
besides the small fry the swallows of swords and the grimace makers real performances took place on the green
even this comedian of jaws and claws was eclipsed in success
that success was prodigious still it remained local
it took a hundreds thirty years for the name of shakspere to penetrate from england inter france
the glory of gwynplaine had not passed london bridge
these were remarkable talents
besides this he harangued like cicero as we have just seen sold is drugs attended sickness and even healed the sick
ursus was satisfied with the applause of southwick but by no means astonished
at every performance the yards of the inn transformed into a pit was filled with a ragged and enthusiastic audience
the emptying of tankards did not decrease their success
this connoisseur was suddenly fascinated and had adopted the laughing man
he did not come everye evening but when he came he led the public applause grew into acclamation success rose not to the roof for there was none but to the clouds for there were plenty of them
which clouds seeing that there was no roof sometimes wept over the masterpiece of ursus
his enthusiasm caused ursus to remark this man and gwynplaine to observe him
they had a great friend in this unknown visitor
one evening ursus was in the side scene which was the kitchen door of the green box seeing master nickolas standing by him showed him this man in the crowd and asked him
what a pity that he should not be a lord
he would make a famous scoundrel
at that hour there was no one in the fair ground except perhaps some reeling drunkard making staggering shadows and dark corners
on a second of the months at two in the morning our precious cargoes luggage was taken on board the goods ship vulgar
but in the cause of science men are expected to suffer
well and have we a fairway
my uncle was delighted for myself moody and dissatisfied i appeared almost to expected glimpse of the ghost of hamlet
but no ghost anything else appeared upon the ancient walls
the fact is the castle as much later than the time of the heroes prince of denmark
no mister hard wigs said the captain no fear of that
at all events we shall get there some day
on the eleventh day we sighted cape portland over which towered mountain metals yoke which the weather being clear we made out very readily
the vagary kept off the coast steering to the westwards
on all sides were to be seen whole schools of wales and sharks
nearly the whole population of the town was on foot to see land
the fact was that scarcely any one of them but expected some goods by the periodical vessel
then without further remark he put his finger to his lips frowned darkly and descended into the small boat which awaited us
he was however but a civil servant a magistrate the governor of the island baron tramp
the professor knew whom he had a deal with
this modest scholars spoke no languages safe icelandic and latin
when therefore he addressed himself to me in the language of horace we at once came to understand one another
now harry said my uncle rubbing his hands on goes well the worse difficulties now over
in the meantime there is n an hour to lose
veryain likely i may find there s manuscripts from the hand of suck nis
i shall be glad to consult them
they were now however absent duty
though not very large it appeared not likely to be filled for centuries
i have not the slightest doubt that in high winds its red tiles were blown out to the great anoints of the pastor and congregation
thanks to the heat of these residences grass grows in the roof which grasses carefully cut for hay
i saws but few inhabitant stirring my excursion but i met a crowd on the beach drying salting and loading codfish the principal article of exportation
the men appeared robust but heavy fair haired like germans but of pensive mean exiles of a higher scale in the latter of humanity than eskimos but i thought much more unhappy since with superior perceptions they are compelled to live within the limits of the poor circle
i began to enjoy the exhilarating delight of travelling a life of desire gratification and liberty
hans our extraordinary guide went first walking with a steady rapid unvarying step
our two horses with the luggage followed of their own accord without requiring whip or spur
geographers have divided into four parts and we had across the south west quarter which in vary is called sod vest furin
we took our way through poor and sparse meadows which made a desperate effort every year to show a little green
they very rarely succeeded in a good show of yellow
i could not help smiling to see look so big on his little horse his long legs now and then touching the grounde made him look like a six footed centaur
snow tempest impracticable roads rocks icebergs nothing stops him
we may do so was my reply but what about a worthy guide
i should have a violent attack of the cramp if i were not to have some sort of exercise
my arms are right but my leger getting a little stiff
here and there could be seen an isolated farm some solitary burr or icon a house built of wood earths fragments of lava looking like beggars in the highway of life
a few straight hows and sheep were only seen occasionally
little did expects however the spectacle which awaited us on we reached the peninsula of sneffels where a glomeris of nature's ruins former kind of terrible chaos
it consists simply of a few houses not what in england or germany we should call a hamlet
i took occasioned to consult the map to see where garter was to be found
these sacred edifices are however veryain much like these people who do without watches and never missed them
to writ over salt water upon the back of little horse seemed to me absurd
in any case i shall trust rather to my own intelligence than theirs
but my uncle was in no humour to wait
at length the sturdy little pony spreading out his legs in a stiff and ludicrous attitude goth from under the professor's legs and left him standing with both feet on a separate stone like the colossus of roads
he says tied replied my uncle translating the danish word for my information
i thoroughly understood and appreciated the necessity for waiting before crossing the fiord for that moment when the sea at its highest point is in a state of slack water
accustomed as i had been to the steam fairy boats of the elbe i founded the long oars of the boatman but sorry means of locomotion
but this power of discernment was denied them and only in after years with the love once of their own firesides close about them was the whole picture revealed
one dark night at the head of a score of his tribe he fell upon w bigg on's camp his object being the abduction of the princess
while the attack was successful in away its main purpose failed
a counter attack was made upon loma and he was driven deep into the wilderness with great loss
three days later mine talk became news him's wife at the hudson bay post
from that hour dated one of the most sanguinary feuds in the history of the great trading company a few which as we shall see was destined to live evening unto the seconds generations
meanwhile two children came to bless the happy union of new some and his lovely indian life
the other was a girl three years younger and news insisted that she be called minute tukey
curiously enough the blood of wabi ran almost pure to his indian forefathers while min took as she became older developed less of the wild beauty of her mother and more of the softer loveliness of the white race her wealth of soft jet black hair and her great dark eyes contrasting with the lighter skins of her father's blood
wabi on the other hand was an indian in appearance from his moccasins to the crown of his head swore the sinewy and agile as a lengths and with every instinct in him crying for the life of the wild
one of nu son's chief pleasures in life had been the educating of his wooden bride and it was the ambition of both that the little min talk in her brother be reared in the ways of white children
consequently both mothers and father began their education at the post they were sent to the factor school and two winters were passed in poor arthur that they might have the advantage of thoroughly equip schools
the children proved themselves unusually bright pupils and by the time wabi with sixteen and min took twelve one would not have known from their manner of speech that indian blood ran in their veins
it was at about this time in their lives that the wound is became especially daring in their depredations
at last so daring did he become that the provincial government placed a price upon his head and upon those of a number of his most notorious followers
but each week added to his lowliness and his longings for ma talk he and his forests
necessity had become his grim master in the following week he was doing to work
a thousand plans were made a thousand adventures pictured and the mother would smile and laugh and planned with them
but in time the end of it all came and while be went back to the princess mother to min tukey and to his forests
there were tears in the boy's eyes when they parted and the mothers cried for the indian boy who was returning to his people
spring came and pass and then summer
we shall make more money up here this winter than you could earn in destroy in three years
mal hunt wolves the country is alive with them and the government gives a bounty of fifteen dollars for every scout taken
three weeks later came will big go on's reply
on the tenth of october he would meet ride a spruce wood on the black sturgeon river
there was little time to lose in making preparations and the fourth day following the receipt of wabi letters found rawding his mother waiting for the train which was to whirl the boy into his new life
chapter sevens the home coming
colone lait talbot regarded the white flag with feelings in which triumphant sadness were mingled strangely
but the emotions of harry and his comrades were for the moment those of victory only
boats put up both from the fort end the shore
the smoke itself which had formed a vast cloud over the harbor forts and city was now drifting out to sea leaving all things at sharply in the dazzling sunlight of u southern springing day
that white flag and those boats going out mean that sumter as ours
but the negotiations were soon completed
all the amenities were preserved between the captured garrison and their captors
the great state of virginia mother of presidents went out of the unions at last and north carolina tennessee and arkansas followed her but maryland kentucky missouri still hung in the balance
lincoln had called for volunteers to putt down a rebellion but harry heard everywhere in charleston that the confederacy was now secure

beauregard at once wrote in order
colonel kenton writes wisely
we need kentucky and i understand that a veryain little more may bringing the state to us go with your fathers i understand that you have been a brave young soldier here and may you do as well up there
harry feeling pride but not showing it saluted and left the room going at once to madame d lays where he had left his baggage
he intended to leave early in the morning but first he saw his friends and told them good bye
harry gave his farewells with deep and genuine regret
whether their manner was graver frivolous he knew that these were good friends of his and he sincerely hope that he would meet them again
it was a different harry who stirred at home lid in april
for months had made great changes he bore himself more like a man his manner was much more considered in grave
he had seen great things and he had done his share of them
he gazed upon a world full of responsibilities and perils
but he look back at charleston the gay the vault on the beautiful with real affections
it was almost buried now in flowers and foliage
he was going home after victory
he soon left charleston out of sight
he felt the difference as soon as he reached the hills of his native state
people were cooler here and they were more prone to look at the two sides of a questions
the air two was unlike that of sou carolina there was a sharper tang to it
it whipped his blooded as it blew down from the slopes and crests
it was afternoon when he reached the little station of winton and left the train a tall sturdy boy the superior of many a man in size strength and agility
there were never before such times an old conte king
bill scullion is ganging them mountaineers were up
he did not say the last as a boast but merely ass an assurance to the liveryman who he saw was anxious on his account
if you've got pistols just you think once before you shoot said collins
harry thanked him through his saddle bags across the horse a powerful bay and giving a final wave of his hands to the sympathetic liveryman rode away
this was not the fashion of a year ago when they exchanged a friendly word or two but harry knew its cause now nobody could trusts anybody else
but he saw nothing that moved there no signal lights twinkled
one winter evening as soon as his work was over for the day joseph locked the door of his smithy washed himself well put on clean clothes and taking his violin set out for testbridge mary was expecting him to tea
it was the afternoon of a holiday and she had closed early
was there ever a happier man than josephs that night as he strode along the footpaths
he pressed his violin case to his heart as if it were a living thing that could know that he loved it
earth was gone in heav'n was all
bless am i hear now my god and bless shall i be there then
when he reached the suburbs the light of homes was shining through curtains of all colors
just then he was a no mood to think of the sorrows
the nettle in the dark said josephs
he was in a moode from musick was he not
he laid down his violin and seated himself where mary told him in her father's armed chair by the fire
letty finding herself not quite equal to the emergency came in her turned to call mary she went as quietly as if she were leaving at tiresome visitor
the music was broken in josephs left alone with the dumb instruments
but in his hands solitude and a violin were sure to marry in musick
they sat down and listened in silence
her heart seemed to swell up into her throat and it was all she could do to keep from weeping
a little longer and she was compelled to yielded and the silent tears flowed freely
letty too was overcome more than ever she had been by musick
let but a moods be strong enough and the soul clothing itself in that moode is with a garments can walk abroad and haunt the world
it cried loud that eternity was veryain longs and like a great palace without a quiet room
nor was this exactly the shape the thing took to the consciousness of the musician
i love thee i love thee cried the violin and the worship was entreaty that knew not itself
hast thou yet to learn that the love of the human is love is divine is but a lower forms of the part of a love of gods
when thou lovest man or woman or childs yea are evenin dog aright then wilt thou no longer needed that i tell thee how god and his christ would not be content with each others alone in the glories evening of the eternal original love because they could create more love
he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how shall we love god whom he hath not seen
a sobs like a bird knew borne burst from mary's bosom
that enchantment had possessed him usurping as it were the throne of his life and displacing it when it ceased he was not his own master
he started to conscious confusion only neither knowing where he was nor what he did'
how it happened he never could tell but he brought down his violin with a crash against the piano that then somehow stumbled and all but fell
in the active recovering himself he heard the neck of his instrument part from the body with a tearing discordant cry like the sounds of the ruin of a living worlds
his violin was broken but his being was made whole
his treasure taken type of hisself and a woman given him instead
mistlike him he murmured
you'll all be over if don't have a care
looks like a dump of bushes down there but i ain't sure can you make it out
yes a gree that does look like bushes

slowly but steadily the slender line was paid out amid a tins silence on the part of the little group at the top of the canyon
after what seemed to them ours a sharp call from the debts reached their ears
li quickly made fest the line do a tree

he is so far to the right of me that i can't reach it

liege leaning over the brink was able to follow the boy's movements by the aid of the thin ark of light made by the torch int tad's hand
but from the cautious movements of the light far beloved them the guide understood that the lad was at work carrying out his part of the tasks of rescue to the best of his ability
mebby you think he said some sort of a picnic down there lay lige

he no doubt would bringing food of some kind with him
with a shout the boys stashed pale mill to meet the pack train and falling in behind the slow moving boroughs urs them on with the ris shouts and sundry resounding slept on the animal's flanks

supper having been finished the party gathered about the kep fire for their evening chat after which admonishing sassy to keep it the distant and not to go borrowing trouble's turned in for a sound sleep
as yet they had been unable to ap any fancy writing with their ponies owing to the rugged nature of the country through which they had been journeying
the boys were nail all anxiety to start while the ponies after their sunday rest were almost ale of life as were their owners
the little animals were becoming more surefooted everyday and ned said that before the trip finished jimmy would be able to walk a slack rope
i early struck with bad so that the party reached the promise table lands shortly before tim at log in the forenoon
a temporary cap was quickly pitched
the great green filled surged on all sides by tall trees made the place an ideal one for their purpose
it was a beautiful race the little indian pony sim to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the contest stretching themselves al of their full lengths and with heads on a level with their backs fairly flew across the great plot of green
all agreed the tad superior horsemanship alone had won the race for him
galloping ned to camp the boy fetched to his somber you well out into to the failed and tossed away
then bidding the boys rid up near the spot to watch in he drew off some ten rods and wheeling spurt cory to a read
grasping the pummel with the left hand to happer to dive head first toward the ground
they saw his long hair almost brush the grass when it his hand swept down and and what's more tad butler rose standing in his stirrups uttering a cowboy jar as he waved the sombrero and high
that bays howled with delight that is all did save stacy brim
tad is an experienced whiter

once more stacy approached the sombrero is pony running well and as he drew near it they saw him rise in the saddle just as tad butler had done a few minutes before
if the milt when he freed his left blot from the stirrup he threw his body sharply tor the right reaching for the hat without taking the precautions to grass the poee
as a result instead of stopping when he reached the hat the boy kep on going

the lads found that a paa blankets signed to each of them with an ordinary waggon sheet doubled for a tarp
these they spread out on the grow using boots wrapped in coats for pillows
stacy brown proved the only grubber in the lot de clearing that he could not sleep a week on such a bed is that

i asked bad
we had better start the drive this morning
what a fusses made about you my dear little friends
you surely cannot suppose that in a natural' state you would be forced to climb regularly up one tall beare stick such as i see you upon now
your cousin the wilde convolvulus whom i left in the fields this morning does no such thing i assure
my young plans require heat or they would not live and the pots we are kept in protects from those cruel wire worms who delight to destroy all roots
why not allow your silver tufts to luxor in a natural manner
still the rose tree stood out that there must be som grat advantages and a gardener's care for she could not pretend to be ignorant of her own superiority to all her wild relations and the woods
then the wind took another frolic round the garden and made up to the large white lily into whose refined ear he whispered a doubt as to the necessity or advantage of her thick powerful stem being propped up against a stupid ugly stick
he really grieved to see it
did that lovely creature supposed that nature who had done so much for her that the fame of her beauty extended throughout the worlds had yet left her so weak c and feeble that she could not support herself in the positions most calculated to give her ease and pleasure
indeed not a flower escaped his mischievous suggestions
echoed the flowers tremulously as with a sort of fearful pleasure they awaited his approach
making a sort of eddying circuit round the garden he knocked over the cul reals pole tore the strips from the stick that held up the white lily loos all the carnation flowers from their fastenings broke the rose tree down and leveled the sweet peas to the grounds
meanwhile how fared it with the flowers
oh that she were once more climbing up the friendly fur pole
the honeysuckle escaped no better and the carnation was ready to die of vexation at finding that her coveted freedom had leveled her to the dirt
before the day closed the gardener came whistling from his farm work to look overt his pretty charges
but for the sight that awaited him he was not prepared at all
weeds meanwhile sprang up and a dreary confusion reigned in the once orderly in brilliant little garden
the mistress had returned and the young lady was with her and hurried at once to her favorite garden
in this positions she remained until a gentle hand was laid upon her shoulder
i'm not thinking about the garden mamma replied the young girl without lifting up her face we can plant new flowers and tie up even some of these afresh
in those veryain early times there was a man named deucalion and he was the son of prometheus
after jupiter had bound prometheus on mt caucasus and it sent diseases in cares into the worlds men became very varying wickedly
these men he said to his mighty company are nothing but a source of trouble
but men kept on fighting and robbing evened while the rain was pouring down and the sea was coming up over the land
no one but to cleon the son of prometheus was ready for such a storm
the dayes coming said prometheus when jupiter will send a flooded the destroyed mankind from the earths

when at last they reached the plain they found themselves at the head of a noble company of human beings all eager deserve them
one at last the queen gave birth to a daughter the king was so overjoyed that he gave a great christening feast the like of which had never before ben known
one of the young fairies overhearing her and fancying she might work some mischief to the little baby went and hid herself behind the hangings in the hall so as to be able to have the last word and undo any harmed the old fairy might wish to work
the turn of the old fairy had now come and she declared while her head shook with malice that the princess should pierce her hand with a spindle and die of the wound
it is true i cannot entirely on do what my elder has done
now fifteen years after the princess was borne she was with the king and queen at one of their castles and as she was running about by herself she came to a little chamber at the tops of a tower and there sad an honest old woman's spinning but she had never heard of the king edict
she had no sooner taken up the spindle then being hasty and careless she pierced her hand with the point of it and fainted away
he knew that she would not awake for a hundred years
one said it was an enchanted castle another that witches and this there but most believe that it was occupied by great ogre which carried thither all the children he could catch and ae them up one at a time for nobody could get at him through the wood
the young prince at these words felled himself on fire
scarcely had he come to the wood when all the trees and thorns which had made such an impenetrable thicket opened on one side in the other to offer him a paths
he entered a large fore chord and stoodst still with amazement and ae
but the faces of the men were rosy and the goblets by them had a few drops of wine left
he entered the guard room there the guards stood drawn up in mine with carbines at their shoulders but they were sound asleep
he passed through one apartment after another where were ladies and gentlemen asleep in their chairs or standing
i have waited long for you
they talked for four hours and it not then said half that was in their heads to say
meanwhile all the rest of the people in the castle had been awakened at the same moment as the princess and they were now extremely hungry
but lady and waiting became vary impatient and at length announced of the princess that they all awaited for her
then the prince took the princess by the hand she was dressed in great splendour but he did not hint that she looked as he had seen pictures of his great grandmother look he thought her all the more charming for that
the violins and ho boys played old but excellent pieces of musick and after supper to lose no time the grand omer married the royal lovers and the chapel of the castle
he turned to show them the castle but behold
when she said good night to bey and went to her chamber over that were the loved parent and friend would fall asleep no more she felt as if she went walking along to her tomb
at the time marry had noted nothing of these things now she saw them all as for the first time in minute detail while slowly she went up the stair and through the narrowed ways and heard the same wind that raved alike about the new grave in the old house into which latter for all the bales banked against the walls it found many a chink of entrance
when she opened the door of it the bright fire which bey undesired had kindled there startled her the room looked unnatural uncanny because it was cheerful
she stood for a moment on the hearth and in sad dreamy mooded listened to the howling swoops of the wind making the house quiver and shake
this was her dream as nearly as she could recall it when she came to herself after waking from it with a cry
she was one of a large company at a house where she had never been before a beautiful house with a large garden behind
it was a summer night and the guests were wandering in and out at will and threw house and garden a mid lovely things of all colours and odors
but she knew nobody and wandered alone in the garden oppressed with something she did not understand
at the end of it she was in a place of toms
she entered and the servants soft flitted in silent were busy carrying away the vessels of hospitality and restoring order as if already they prepared for another company on the morrow no one heeded her
she was lost lost utterly with an eternal loss
she knew nothing of the place had nowhere to go nowhere she wanted to go had not a thought to tell her what questioned to ask if she met a living soul
but living soul there could be none to meet
she had lost him years and years before and now she saw him he was there and she knew him
he came to her side and she gave him no greeting
i know it and there is no waking
the old time was but a thicker dream and this is truer because more shadowy
her only life was was that she was lost
shall i pour out my soul into the ear of a mist of fume from my own brain
thus was she borne away captive of her dead neither willing nor unwilling of life and death equally careless
with that came a pang of intense pain
she herself should have been a plum a leir in a white gown and green scarf coming to him through the long grass under the blossomed boughs
her hands should have been full of blue bells and she should have held them up to his face in maidenly defence as he sprang forward to take her in his arms
you see that she knew exactly how trust is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheaper weekly journals
she had to the full them it allowed of her reading in her environment the literary sense
and curiously enough she was hardly curious at all about what he might have to say
she only wished for may and the orchards instead of january and the dingy dusty waiting room the plain faced preoccupied travellers the dim desolate weather
the setting of the scene seemed to her all important
it was bitterly cold but the embankment was more romantic than a railway carriage
he had been late he had offered no excuse no explanation
but here the only thing that occurred to her was to stop and look in one of the shops till he should ask her what she was looking at
the keen wind thrust itself even inside the high collar of her jacket
her hands and feet were aching with cold
she would have shared his sorrow and shown herself half wife half angel from heavens in this dar hour
she said how frightfully cul is
and yesterday had a letter from her and she seems to expects to think and i thought i us to tell you darlings
a shock of unbelievable re leaf tingled through her sot that was all what was it compared with her fears
what opinions would he formed the purity of her mind the innocence of her soul if an incident like this failed to shock her deeply
following the tingle of relief came a sharp sickening pinch of jealousy and mortifications these inspired her
i don't wonder you were afraid to tell me she began you don't love me you've never loved me i wasn't idiot to believe you did'
those four true words wounded her more than all the rest
couldn't help it then how can i ever trustee
do you think i'm not sorry now
no it's only painful for booth of us
i didn't think a decent man could do such things she was pulling on her gloves go home and glow over it all
he stood up suddenly do you mean it
are you really going to throw me over for a thing like this
and he strode down between the marble tables and out by the swinging door it was a veryain exit
at the corner he remembered that he had gone away without pang for the tea and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy that error
he checked the clem pulse
so he had listed and went to south africa and he never came home covered with metals and glory which was rather his idea to the few simple words of explanations that would have made all straight and repaid her and him for all the past
the last strains of the ill treated ill fated intermezzo had died away and after them had died away also the rumbling of the wheels of the murderous barr organ that had so gaily executed that along with the nine other tunes of its report to the admiration of the housemate at the window of the house opposite and the crowing delight of the two baby's next door
the younger man drew a deep breath of relief and lighted the wax candles in the solid silver candlesticks on his writing tablet for now the late summer dusk was falling in that odin please heavens made fool the measure of the days appointed torture
then there was silence th a sigh and the sound of light moving feet on the gravel
and again he listened with a quiet pleasure
never had any act seems so impossible
there is a seat in the garden at the side of the house again she hesitated
th she turned towards the quarter indicated and disappeared round laurel bushes
look here he said this is all nonsense you know you are tired out and there' something wronging what is it
do drank this and then tell me perhaps i can help yo
he hardly cut cake im pressed it upon her
he had no time to think but he was aware that this was the most exciting adventure that had ever happened to him
it only that your poor where that's nothing i poor too she laughed
her little foot tapped the gravel impatiently
he told me to stay on at the hotel and i didn and then one night when i was at the theater my maid of horrid french thing we gott in paris packed up all my trunks and took all my money and paid the bill and went
she said again you are kind
well then i went into lodgings that wicked woman buff me one street suit and to day they turned me out because my money was all gone
let me think he said how glad i am that you happen to come this way
i shall lock up all the doors and windows in the house and then i shall give you my latch key and you can let yourself in and stay to might heere there is no one in the house
i will catch the night train and bring my mother of to morrow then we will see what can be done
you see papa so veryain rich and at home they expected me t to get acquaint with dukes and things and she stopped
it wasn't i you said that said the girl smiling but that's so anyhow and then she sighed
all the same he added irrelevantly you shall have the l key
you are kind she said for the third time and reached her hand out to him he did not kiss it then only took it in his and felt how small and cold it was then it was taken away
the lady and the guitar certainly passed the night at hill view villa but when his mother veryain angry and very frightened came up with him it about noon the house look just as usual and no one was there but the charwoman
the silvers all right thing goodness she said but your band girl is taken a pair of your sister's s stockings and those new shoes offers with the silver buckles and she's left these

i hastened back to the lines
the cloud of revels we had seen divided itself into three columns
a perfect blaze of close range musketry too mo them down the grass
they lay in heaps of dozens even close up to the works
that night i stood guard under an oak tree on the battle field amongst the unburied dead
indeed we of the rank and file had little confidence and grant in those days
rose crans protested it was in vain
it required months a great events to make grant the hero of the army which he afterward became
for some reason the dead at hathe bridge were not buried
a week after the battle my brother rode by there on a cavalry expedition and made the horrible discovery that hogs were eating up the bodies of our dead heroes that two was war
long ago there lived merchant who had three daughters
every year at a certain day of a certain months he went away to a distant city to collect money when they count
how do you know asked their father i am older and wiser than you are and i know that there are many evils which might come upon you
when it was evening he led his band into a near by street and in his disguise approached the merchant's house he knocked at the door
have pity upon a poor unfortunate one he called out
let me enter i pray you to pass in light under your roof
its surely a terrible storm outside said the merchant's eldest daughter as the wind rattled the tiles of the roof and the rain beat in torrents against the doors and windows
he is old as well as poor she said
if we decide to sh mercy to this poor beggar it is not for you to oppose it
but we should not forget our promise to our father cried the youngest daughter
however in spite of all she could say the elder sisters opened the door and admitted the bigger
it is a fearful night to send away a beggar said the eldest sister while they were eating
while they were talking the beggar had taken the apples which the girls were to eat for dessert and had sprinkled a sleeping powder over them
the two eldest ate their apples but the youngest could not eat that night she threw the apple away
she didn stir and he knew that the sleeping powder had thoroughly done its work
then she heard him go down the stairway and unbolt the heavy doors which led into the store
it was the youngest one who deceived me cried the robber chieftain
perhaps we can outwit her yet cried another
the merchant's daughter at first did not answer but as he kept on calling to her she finally asked him what it was that he wanted
i promise you i will do you no harms
you shall not come into to my father's house
hass the charm out to me then said the robber
when she returned his hand was sticking through the hole and door
the cries and curses of the robbers filled the air
they tried in vain to break down the great doors
all my worries about you were foolish
he had little enough to break or bite and once when there was a great famine the land he could hardly procure even his daily bread and as he lay thinking in his bed one knight he sighed and said to his wife what will be come of us
how c you feet our children when we have no more than we can eat ourselves
o you simpleton said she then we must all for die of hunger you had better plain the coffins for us
but she left him no peace till he consented saying ah but i shall miss the poor children
and as soon as their parents had gone to sleep he got up put on his coat and unbarring the back door went out
ah father said hands i am looking at my white cat sitting upon the roof of the house and trying to say good bye
but in reality hans was not looking at a cat but every time he stopped he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path
but her husband felt heavy at heart and th it were better to share the last cross with the children
early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed and gave them each s lace of bread which was still smaller than the former piece
we are going into the forest to hu would and in the evenings when we were ready we will come infect you again
hsi thought the roof tasted veryain nice and so he tore off a great peace while gretel broke a large round pain out of the windows and sat down quite contentedly
come in and stop with me and no harm shall come to you and so saying she took them both by the hand and led them into her cottage
the old woman behaved veryain kindly to them but in reality she was a wicket old which who waylaid children and built a bread house in order to entice them in but it soon as they were in her power she killed them cooked them in ate them and made a great festival of the day
then she took up hansel with her rough hand and shut him up in a little cage with a latest door and although he screamed loudly it was of no use
grettel began to cry but it was all useless for the oldwit made her do ash she wanted
ghoul she cried in a passion get some water quickly they hands fatter lean this morning i will kill and cook him
dear good god helps now she prayed
creep in said the witch and see if it is hot enough and then we will put in the bread but she intended when gretel got inn to shut up the ovens and let her bake so that she might eat her as well as hansel
see i could even get in myself
and she got up and put her head into the ovens
and now as there was nothing to fear they went back to the witch's house wherein airy corner were caskets fu of pearls and precious stones
then they began to run and rushing into the house they fell upon their father's neck
not having heard from captain benny dick for some little time randal thoughted desirable in sidney's interest to make inquiries at his club
the sailing master announced that he had orders to take the vessel back to her port with no other explanation than that the crews was over
this alternative in the captain's plans terminating the voyage a month earlier than his arrangements had contemplated puzzled randal
randal waited while in london on the chance that bennydeck might pay him a visit
he is staying at this hotel to try the air of sydenham and he finds that agrees with him
had her beauty fascinated him
randal wrote to accept the invitation determining to present himself before the appointed hour and to questioned catherine privately without giving her the advantage over him of preparing herself for the interview
after months of separation he received a visit from herbert
you distress me herbert more than words can say
he drank the wine greedily
whatever reviving effected might otherwise had produced on him it made no change in the threatening gloom of his manner
he puts down the empty glass taking no notice of his brother's questions
randal he said you know where sydney is
i will do neither the one nor the others
you don't know what it is to be used to seeing a pretty creature always nicely dressed always about the room thinkings so much of you and so little of herself and then to be left alone as i am left out in the dark
i'm alone do you hear that alone
i haven't courage enough to do it for myself
o why did i engage that governess
i'm afraid he said
i tried it yesterday it' set my brains on fire i'm feeling that glass i took just now
he paused and put his hand to his fevered head
was his mind wandering into some other train of thoughts
you can't do it
let me hear what it is first
i feel for you herbert he said warmly
she shall have your message all that i can do to persuade her shall be done
let me rest a little he pleaded if i'm not in the way
he mentioned the name of one of the olds servants at mount morven who had attached himself to randal after the break up of the family
on the next day but one randal arranged his departure for sidham so as to arrive at the hotel an hour before the time appointed for the dinner
the new number of a popular a weekly journal had that day been published randal bought
after reading one or two of the political articles he arrived at the columns specially devoted to fashionable intelligence
rana looked again at the first words in the paragraph
with his own suspicions steadily contradicting him he arrived at the hotel obstinately believing that the charming widows would prove to be a stranger
missus norman and her little daughter where out driving with a friend and were expected to return in good time for dinner
missus presty was at home she was reported to be in the garden of the hotel
how nice of you to come so soon she began
she added looking at him suspiciously
but you ought to have have known that we are only half an hour behind you at sidon them in the matter of news
there re port his premature my good friend
but if these newspaper people waited to find out whether report is truer false how much gossip would society get in its favourite newspapers
you are to understand that catherine is a widow
sit down said missus presty
ye shall hear how my divorce daughter and my poor little grandchild were treated at sandy seal after you left us
you would have seen her pining for the company of other children and would have had no mercy on her
he was introduced to missus norman and to missus norman's little girl and we were all charmed with him
when he and i happen to be left together he naturally wondered after having seen the beautiful wife where the lucky husband might be
and the captain of course concluded after having been introduced to kitty that missus norman was a widow
where stories have beens printed i do assure you where stories have been printed
before i consented to answer the child's inquiries i came to an understanding with her mother
honestly
after that i had her mother's authority for telling kitty that she would never see her fathers again
she asked directly if her fathers was dead
that will do missus presty your defenses thoroughly worthy of your conducts in all other respects
rattle pass this over without notice
a veryain wise decision she remarked
have you any message for captain bennydeck
not at the hotel just now
it was a relief to randal in the present state of catherine's relations towards bene to returned to london without having seen his friend
good bye dear randal
arrived at the station randal found that he must wait for the train
while he was walking up and down the platforms with a mind doubly distressed by anxiety about his brother and anxiety about sydney the train from london came in
what are you doing here he asked
you have been to the hotel he burst out you have seen catherine
we have both seen the same newspaper of course and you have been the first to clear the thing up that's it is in it
not satisfied with gossip in private the greedy public appetite devours gossip in print and once more of it than any one editor can supply
supposing the report had been true
in the meantime after what missus presty had confessed the cruel falsehoods which had checked poor kitty's natural inquiries raised an insuperable obstacle to a meeting between father and childs
he had promised to do his best towards persuading catherine to grant sydney an interview
even the chance of successfully confiding her to ben ed x protection had lost something of its fair promise since randal's visit to side them
be the results however what they might randal could see but one plain course before him now
considerations of delicacy seemed to forbid taking this liberty evening with an intimate friend'
what happy or future could await her especially if she justified randal's pasted experience of all that was candid and truthful in her characters then to become his friend's wife
shall i say that she may expecting early visit from you when i see her to morrow
he added sidney's address in a postscript and despatched his letter that evening
but it might perhaps be excusable to infer that the marriage had not yett been decided on and that the captain's proposals were still waiting for catherine's reply
go do you hear
but i mess than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centered in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with e polyps nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry
and the cry issued from his pours if we may th speak a cry frightful in its silence
devon he rushed towards the old man and made him in hale powerful restorative
davy unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man
for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and payers
what do you mean sir
oh you rave sir exclaimed villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken i rave
do you know the assess asked maraud
noirtier looked upon moral with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made valentine happy and thus fixed his attentions
said morrel sedley yes replied noirtier
the old man's eyes remained fixed on the door
as well yes
must i leave alone no
but can he understand you yes
gentlemen he set in a horse voice give me your word of honour that this horrible secret shall for ever remained buried amongst ourselves the two men drew back
my father has revealed the culprit's name my father thirsts for revenge is much as you do yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this secrete do you not father
mor else suffered an exclamation of horror and surprised to escape him
the old man made a sign in the aff imitative
it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair via whose tears silently rolled on his cheeks
but he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone
water was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips
the nearest said the district doctor is a good italian abbe who lives an next door to you shall i call on him as a pass
davie said villefort be so kind i was see you as to accompany the gentleman here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my child's room do you wish to see him
i only wis to be alone you will excuse me will you not
i am going sir and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers would be more fervent than mine
but with full ravishment the hours of prime singing received they in the midst of leaves that ever bore a burden to their rhymes
all waters that on earth most limpid are would seem to have within themselves some mixture compared with that which nothing doth conceal
thou makest me remember where and what prosper that moment was when lost her mother her and she herself the springing
i do not think's shone so great alight under the lads of venus when transfixed by her own son beyond his usual custom
yee are new comers and because i smile began she peradventure in this place elected to human nature for its nest
some apprehension keeps you marvelling but the palm delicate giveth light which has the power to unclouded your intellects
the goods supreme soule in itself delighting created man good and this goodly place gave him as hands of eternal peace
by his default short while he sojourned here by his default to weeping and to toil he changed his innocent laughter and sweet play
this every other savour does transcend and notwithstanding slaked so far may be thy thirst that i reveal to thee no more
between her steps and mine were not a hundreds when equally the margins gave a turn in such away that to the east i faced
nor evening thus are w continued far before the lady wholly turn herself unto me saying brother look and listen
now hal kon must needs pour forth for me and with her choir urania must assist me to puts inverse things difficult to think
then back i turned my face to those high things which moved themselves towards us so sedately they had been distance by new wedded brides
and i beheld the flame lights onward go leaving behind themselves the air depicted and they of trailing pennons had the semblance so that it overhead remained distinctly with sevenfold lists all of them of the colors whence the sun's bow is made and deals girdle
these standards to the rearward longer wor than was my sight and as it seemed to meet ten paces where the outermost apart
the interval between these four contained a chariot triumphal on two wheels which by a griffin's neck came drawn along
not only rome with no such splendid car air gladdened africanus or augustus but poor to it that of the sun would be
three maidens at the right wheel in a circle came onward dancing one so veryain red that in the fire she hardly had been noted
the second was as if her flesh and bones had al been fashioned out of emerald the third appeared as snow but newly fallen
in rear of all the group here treated of two old men i beheld unlike in habit but like in gate each dignified and grave
and when the car was opposite to me thunder was heard and all that folk august seemed to have further progress indited
and one of them as if by heaven commissioned singing vain spots a dii bann shouted three times and all the others after
as sooner as on my vision smote the power sublime that had already pierced me through air from my boyhood i had yet come forth
to the left hand i turned with that reliance with which the little child runs to his mother when he has fear or when he is afflicted
to say unto virgilius not a dro hum of bloods remains in me that does not tremble i know the traces of the ancient flame
dante because virgilius has departed do not weep yet do not weep yet awhile for by another's sword thou needst must weep
i saw the lady who erewhile appeared veiled underneath the angelic festival directed her eyes to me across the river
look at me well in sooth i'm beatrice
yee keep your watch in the eternal day so that nor night nor sleep can steal from you one stepped the ages make upon their path
therefore my answer is with greater care that he may hear me whose weeping yonder so that the sin and dle bee of one measure
but by the largesse of celestial graces which have such lofty vapours for their reign that near to them our sight approaches not
as soon as ever of my seconded i was upon the threshold and changed life himself from me he took and gave to others
so low he fell that all appliances for his salvation were already short save showing him the people of perdition
confusion and his may together mingled forced such a yes from out my mouth that sight was needful to the understanding of it
whence she to me in those desires of mine which led thee to the loving of that goode beyond which there is nothing to aspire to
and what allurements or what advantages upon the forehead of the others showed that thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them
he translated at an early age chiefly between eighteen forty five in eighteen forty nine a great number of poems by the italians contemporary with dante or preceding him and among other things he made aversion of the whole vena va prose and verse
this book in its original form was received with favour and settled the claim of hersey to rank as a poet translator or indeed as a poet and his own right
the life load of rhythmical translation is this commandment that a good palm shall not be turned into a bat one
the only true motive for putting poetry into a fresh language must be to endowed of fresh nation as far as possible with one more possessions of beauty
poetry not being an exact science the dur reality of rendering is altogether secondary to this chief law
often would he avail himself of any special grace of his own idiom an epoch if only his will belonged to him often would some caen serve him but for his author structure some structure but for his author's caen often the beautiful turn of a stanza must be weakened to adopt some rye which will tally and he sees the poet reveling in abundance of language where himself as scantly supplied
and if you have time it would be a great service to translate the analyses of the palm which i omitted
on january twenty fifth y wrote many a many thanks for a most essential service most thoroughly performed
my notes which you have taken the trouble a revising are of course quite paltry and useless
it is therefore and on all accounts unnecessary to say much more of the work here than it says for itself
throughout the va lava theres a strain like the first falling murmur which reaches the ear in some remote meadow and prepares us to look upon the sea
a word should be said here of the title of don pa's autobiography
this has induce some editors of the vann lava to explained the title as meaning early life
thereafter this son at bread and me desire to write down in verse for other things touching my condition the w things it seemed to me that i had not yet made manifest
which thing being thus there came a day when certain ladies to whom it was well known they haven't been with me at diverse times in my trouble's together for the pleasure of gentle company
but when i still speake not one of them who before had been talking with another addressed me by my name saying to what u lovest vow this lady singing that thou can'st not support her presence
and now that it hath pleased her to d ii mee this love my master of his great goodness hath placed all m be attitude there where my hope will not fail me
then those ladies began to talk closely together and as i have seen snowfall among the rain so was their talk mingled with size
and i declare that when i speak thereof love sh such perfects sweetness over me that if my courage filed not certainly to him my listeners must be all resigned
whatever her sweet eyes are turned upon spirits of love to issue sa in flame which through their eyes who then may look on them pierce to the hard steep chamber everyone
to her i wend along and whose much strength my weakness is made strong
so to the road thou shalt be reconciled and findin the lady and with the lady love
the second begins here an angel the third here dear song i know
the first part is divided into four
in the third i say what it is i purpose to speaks so as not to be impeded by faint heartedness
and the fourth repeating to whom i purpose speaking i tell the reason why i speak to them
in the second i tell what is understood of her on earth here my ladies desired
the second part is divided into two for in the first i speak of her is regards the nobleness of her soul relating some of her virtues proceeding from her soul in the second i speak of her as regards the nobleness of her body nearing some of her beauties here loves set concerning her
this second partes divided into two for in the one i speak of the eyes which are the beginning of love in the second i speak of the mouth which is the under love
and at the first it seemed to me that i saw certain faces of women with their hair loosened which caught out to me thou shalt surely die after the witch other terrible in unknown appearances set unto me thou art dead
and so strong was my fantasy that i wept again and very truth and said with my true voice oh excellent soul how blessed is he that now look ath pon bee
whereby other ladies who were about the room he coming aware of my discomfort by reason of the moan that she made who indeed was of my veryain near kindred led her away from where i was and then set themselves to awaken me thinking that i dreamed and saying sleep no longer and be not d quieted
when being aroused i opened mine eyes and knew that it had been a deceptions
in my hue was such that they looked at each other and thought of death saying under their breath most tenderly o let us comfort him then unto me what dream was thine that it hath shaken thee so much
and therewith all such a bewilderment possessed me that i shut min eye for peace and in my brain did cease order of thought and every healthful thing
then saw i many broken hinted sights in the uncertain state i stepped into
these wilding fantasies then carried me to see my lady dead
the second part begins here i was a thinking the first part de abides into two
this lady's right name was jone but because of her comeliness or at least it was so imagined she was called of many but he m va springing and went by that name among them
in his speech he laughed and laughed again then while it was his pleasure remain i chanced to look the way he had drawn near and saw the ladies jon and beatrice approach me this the other following one in a second marvel instantly
the second part begins here saying b now the third here then while it was his pleasure
he lives thy loss he dies from everyone mangled by thee lightnings of godhead shine from which thy darkness hath not where to hide
