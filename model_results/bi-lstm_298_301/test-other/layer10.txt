there's iron they say in all our blood and a gran or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
margaret said mister hale as he returned from showing his guest downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thornton made his confession of having been a shopboy
you don't mean that you thought me so silly
i really liked that account of himself better than anything else he said
his statement of having been a shopboy was a thing i like best of all
you who were always accusing people of being shop he at helstone
i don't think mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some part of what he said
his father dying in miserable circumstances
why it might have been in the workhouse
his father speculated wildly failed and then killed himself because he could not better disgrace
all his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
no one came forwards to help the mother and this boy
at least no friend came forwards immediately and miss thornton is not won my fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
so they left milton
how tainted asked her father
open pas by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked up upon them only as new ways of extending trade in making money
and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his iron nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
not vicious he never said that
improvident and self indulgent were his words
margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgment which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
however out it came
paa i do think mister thornton a very remarkable man but purse me i don't like him at all
a i do said her father laughing
first me as ye call it and all
i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
but good night child
there was several other science of something wrong about missus hale
she and dixon held mysterious consultations in her bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was a custom when any distress of her mistress called on her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dixon lifted and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
but though she received caresses and fond words back again in touch profusion as would have gladden her formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
she lay weet very long this night planning how to listen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
a servant give dixon permanent assistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attentions she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
visiting register offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she met bessy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
well busy how are you
better and not better if you know what that means
not exactly replied margaret smiling
i'm better in not being torn to pieces by coughing o nights but i'm weary and tired o milton and longing to get away to the lan of boola and when i think i'm farther and farther off my heart sinks none no better i'm worse
margaret turned around to walk along side of the girl in her feeble progress homewards
but for a minute or two she did not speak
at last she said in a low voice
busy do wish to die
bessie was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
not worse than many others are reckon
but what was it
you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton
i had forgotten when i said for the time' continued margaret quietly
i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i'll go with you now
the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
as they turned up into a small court opening out into a scolded street bessy said
you will not be daunted you father's at home and speaks a bit gris at first
but nicholas was not at home when they entered
gas bessy at last
busy took a long and feverish draught and then fell back and shut her eyes
margaret bent ogre and said bessy don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or may have been
remember who gave it to you and made it what it is
now i'll not have my wench preach to
but surely said margaret facing round yee believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of laugh it was to be
i believe we icy an normal
that's what i believe young woman
i don't believe all i hear no not by big deal
but whose come at last and who's welcome as long as who will keep from preaching on what who knows not about
it's simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work
but the girl and ye pleaded the male with margaret
doping hardly on him is a good man he is
i sometimes think i shall be murk with sorrow even in the city of god if other is not there
her feverish collar came into her cheeks and the feverish flame into her eye
but you'll be their father yee shall o my heart
she put her ha to it and became ghastly pale
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
presently the spasm that fore shuddered death had pass'd away and busy roused the soft and said
i'll go to bed it's best place but catching at margaret's gown you'll come again i know y will but just say it
oh come to morrow said margaret
margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
she was late for tea at home
have you met with a servant dear
no mamma that anne buckley would never have done
s'pose i try said mister hale
everybody also had their turn up his great difficulty now let me try
i may be the sindri to put on the slipper after all
what would you do paa i would you set about him
why i would apply to some good house mother to recommend me one known to herself or her service
very good but we must first catch o house mother
the mother of him he spoke to us said margaret
mister thornton the only mother he has i believe said mister hale quietly
i shall like to see her she must be an uncommon person her mother added
perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
she sounded to be such careful economical person that i should like anyone out of the same family
my dear said mister hale all armed pre don't go off on that idea
i'm sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
take notice that this is not my kind of fortin's papa if i have any at all which o own agree to were you always a chusing me of it
i don't know positively that it is hers either but from little things i have gathered from him a fancy sir

dicky was well of questions but mister be had no answers were them
nor was it sunday on which they took a rest and rushed their shirts according to mister beale's rule of life
they did not stay there but walked out across the dawns where the skylights were singing and on a dip of the dance came upon great stone wards and towers were a strong and grey
what's that there said dicky
replied he of a truth i heard him not and i wot him not and folks are all sleeping
but she said whomsoever thou seest awake he is the reciter
then said the eunuch art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him
rejoined the eunuch who then was the reciter point him out to me
by allah replied the fireman i tell thee the truth
tell me what happened what's a mac khan
what ails thee then that thou must needs reside verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the fork are asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
and he also improvised the two following the stitch
when nuzhat al zaman heard the first improvisation she called to wind her father and her mother and her brother and their wm home then she wept and cried to the eunuch and said to him woe to thee
he who recited the first time hath recited the second aimee and heard him hard by
by allah an thou fetch him n to me i will assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee and yee shall beat thee and cast yee out
but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt
returned quickly and linger not
when it was the seventy third nine
but the eunuch said i will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that society the verses for i dread returning to my lady without him
now when the fireman heard these words he feared for twa makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch by allah it was not i and they know him not
so go thou to thy station and if thou again meet anyone after this hour reciting aught of poetry whether he be near or far it will be i or someone i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me
then he kissed the oo's head and spake him fair till he went away but a castrato fetched around and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
i say what made my ignoring what have the beater cup i drain far be from me thy land to flee nor will i bow to those who blame and for such law would deal me shame
then said the eunuch to zu makan bees we with thee o my lord
o my lord continued the eunuch and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
we will do thee no upright o my son nor wrong thee in aught but our object is that thou beent thy gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and returning weal and safety and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news
then the eunuch went out to thur makan and said to him reside what verses thou knowest for my ladies here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition
and also these
then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting feat
when the eunuch saw his case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
after awhile they came to themselves and zat al zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the kan and what had happened to her with the badawi how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother sharrkan and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of bye how he had made that marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the king their sire had sent and asked for her from sharrkan
but now go to thy master and break him quickly to me
the chamberlain called castrato and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the talker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girding his ass and preparing for flight
she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the talker girted his ass for flight and bespake himself saying o would i knew what is become of him
i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence these pages at about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime
why didst thou say i never repeated these couplets nord do i know who remitted them when it was thy companion
but now i will not leave thee between this place and that dad and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee
for as i feared the cardinals discerning but unto allah we are all returning
then the eunuch cried upon you the pages saying take him off the ass
and he answered i am the chamberlain of the emir of damascus king sharpen song of omar bin al nu woman lud bagdad and of the land of khorasan and i bring tribute and presence from him to his father in bagdad
so fairy forwards no harm shall befall you till you join his grant was ear than done
then he bade him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was chamberlain to the emir of damascus and was bound to king omar with presents and the tribute of syria
so it was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the king's son marken and may came sultan over his father's rail
and amongst them where some who would have chosen the cadet zat makan for quoth they his name be light of place and he hath a sister nuzhat al zaman hies the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for alida's and none wotteth what is become of them
so he turned to the wazir dandan and said to him readily your tale is a wonder of wonders
no o chief wazir that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions for let is almighty will restore it to you sa makan and his sister nuzhat al zaman whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can
when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the twain and what befell them and the cause of their long absence
z ram kan bowed his head a while and then said i accepted the position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and sat him on the right way
then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharpen
after a while the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of baghdad and khorasan a conquering host like the pool tied sea and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
when it was the seventh eighth night
any neet or rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place
lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zat makan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and sires son spere
moreover the sultan commanded his wazir d done call a ten days halt of the army that he may be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain
he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days
what had happened to me
he asked himself something warm and living quicken at me it must be in that neighbourhood
when however the juster was quite nigh and to them then did he heal tilly with human voice big in the midst of the kind and apparently all of them had down their hates towards the people

at that moment and a noise when for marriage seaman that of an oar falling in the boat

kind want out re turned with three or four muskets and as many pipes
the still in its that wrangled boat sides was might that of depth
the john behaved beauti free he came round right antar
the question was now whether we could pass them or not for they got noon up to grapple
and captain behaved perfect away when its critic reds and commanding a dead signs in tension to his orders
now are so board the jar heart
when our sid we gave the gentleman the four seeks to out the news into the stern most proving near a tables length that is sent
they were night the yells of fiends in anglers
i doubt if we caches the man in the nez pera
lit state the ship pats ahead all her cams being full leaving the poor most mates in her wake
they swarmed up in front of shar ands palings as thick as they could jam together and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise
some sung out pare down the fence tear down the fence
the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
shirburn run his eyes slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little beout gaze em but they couldn't they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
he average mans a coward
because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back in the dark and it's just what they would do
so they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with a hundreds masts cowards at his back and lunches the rascal
you didn't want to come
but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness
now leave and take your half a man with you tals he h gone up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off everyone way and buck harkness he healed it after them looking tolerable cheat
he can't beat key careful
they argued en tried to keep him out but he wouldn't listen an a whole show come to stand still
and one or two women begin to scream
so then the ring master he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse
it warn't funny to me though i was all but tremble to see his danger
and a horse a going like a house a fire t
he shed him so thick that kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits
why it was one of his own min
an but never mind the rest of his outfit it was jest wide but it was awful funny
the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered it off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and haw hot till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him doing another time
twenty people sings out
the duke says yes
everybody sings out sold
but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench an shouts hold on
jest a word gentleman they stop to listen
what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk to show up and sell the rest of the town
you bad it is the judge is right everybody sings out
we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding downstream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
we never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village
green horns flat heads
no i say is it don't
well it don't because it's in to breathe i reckon they're all alive
well that's what i'm a saying all king's is mostly rats guy's as furs i can make out you dat so
and look at charleses second and lewis fourteen and lewis fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all them saxon heptarchy that used to rip around so in old times in rays gay
my you ought to seem old henry the eight when he was in bloom he was a blossom
ring up fair rosamond
well henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country
s'pose he opened his mouth what then
all i say is kan's as kings and you got to make allowances
take em all around they're a mighty ornery light it's the way they're raised
well they all do jim
now to duke he's a tolerable like of man in some ways
this one's a middlin hard lot for a duke
when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and morning to himself
it don't seem natural but i reckon it so
he was often moaning in morning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying oh l elizabethan
don you hear me shut dead dough
i lay i make you mine
just as loud as i could yell
which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to howl
the king's duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy
why before he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when he'd take off his new white beaver an make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he'd walked right out of the ark and maybe was o vitiges himself
jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my pile ready
wor you bou or young man
get aboard says the king
i done so and then we all three started on again
the young chat was mighty thankful cy was tough work toting his baggage such weather
he asked the king where he was goin and the king told him he'd come down a river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there the young fellow says
but then i says again no i reckon it ain't him or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river you ain't him or you
no my name's oblige it alexander oblige reverend alexander blighted i s'pose i must say as i'm one of the lars poor servants
you see he was pretty old and george's good earls was too young to be much company for except mary jane the red hitting and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didn't seem to care much to let
do bad do bad he couldn't have lived to see his brother's poor soul
i'm goin in a ship next wednesday for rio jan aero where my uncle as
but it'll be lovely wish't i was a goin
mary janes nineteen susan's fifteen and joanna is about fourteen that's the one it gives herself to good works and has a hair lip py things
well they could be worse off
o peter had friends an they ain't goin to let them come to no harm
flame defeated and acquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkes and about peter's business which was a tanner and about george's which was a carpenter and about harvest which was a dissenter and minister and so on and so on then he says
win her deep they won't stop for a hail
was peter wilts well off
when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got all
now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags
so then they waited for a steamboat
but the king was car he says
they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would they tell you
they wanted them says kind of soft in jim
phelps as is one of these little one horse caught in plantations and they all look alike
i went around and climb over the back stile by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen
i out with a yes'm fore i thought
so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
when we got there she set me down in a split bottom chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
well it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt
an i think he died afterwards he was a baptist
yes it was mortification that was it
your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you
ye must ha met him on the road didn't you ogreish man with a
why child it'll be stow
it was kinder thin ice but i says
i had my mind on the children all a time i wanted to get them out to one side and pumped them a little to find out who i was
pretty soon she made the cold chill streak all down my back because she says
i see it warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
so i says to myself here's another place where i got to rest the truth
i opened my mouth to begin but she grab me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes
children don't you say a word
i see i was in a fixed now
missus phelps shed jilts for him and says
has he come no says her husband
i can't imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy
uneasy she says i'm ready to go distracted
he must have come and you've missed him along a road
oh don't distress me any more'n i'm already distressed
why silas look yander up the road ain't that somebody comin
the old gentleman stared and says
i hain't no idea who is it
is tom sawyer
being toime sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river
then i says to myself s'pose time saver comes dan'l that boat
but i am you she please that you have seen my lady
i knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
her conversation has more charms than can be the mere beauty and a humour and disposition would make a deformed person appear lovely
why did you not send me that means and a garland
why the best on is i have a squire that is as good as in night
in earnest we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish an occasions as i cannot tell which is strangers
all the people that i had ever in my life refused were brought again upon the stage like richard the third's ghosts to reproach me withal and all the kindness a's discoveries could make i had for you was late to my charge
my best qualities if i have any that are good served but for aggravations of my fault and i was allowed to have wit an understanding a discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in this
tis a strong chang and i'm very sorry for it but i'll swearing or not how to help it
mister fish is a squire of things and has so many mistresses than anybody may pretend to share in him and re believed though i have the honour to be his near neighbour to speak freely i cannot brag much that he makes any court to me and i know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often
i think my youngest brother comes down with him
i can no sooner give you some little hints whereabout they live but you know them presently an event you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if i incline him to look graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
i have missed four fits and have had but five and have recovered so much strength as may be ventured to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
but besides i can give you others
i am here much more out of people's way than in town but my aunts and such as pretend and interest in me in a power over me do so persecute ment dear good nature i'll take it so ill that they are not accepted as i would live in a hor try to avoid them
you would think him altered and if it be possible more melancholy than he was
if marriage agrees nor better with other people than it does with him i shall pray that all my friends may escape it
well in earnest if i were a prince that lady should be my mistress but i can give no rule to anyone else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing their hearts to her may be infinitely taken with one i should not value at all f so is a justinian wise providence has ordained it that by their different humans everybody might find something to please them starves withal without envying their neighbours
the matter is not great for i confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best please never to be known in it one any occasions whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly avoided one must satisfy oneself by doing nothing that one need care knows
if i had a picture that were fit for you he should have it
how can it talk of the flying fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you could
i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am certain he knows the utmost of the injuries you have received from her
we have had another to beat but much more calmly
then besides there was a time when we ourselves when indifferent to one another did i do so then or have i learned it since
i have been studying how tom cheek might come by his intelligence and i very believe he has it from my cousin peters
how kindly do i take the civilities of your fathers in earnest you cannot imagine how his let appease me
would it would leave me and then i could believe i shall not always have occasion for it
my poor lady vavasor is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against a protector and did not discover it
she has told now all that was told her but vows you will never say from whence she had it we shall see whether her resolutions are is unalterable as those of my lady talmash
i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
i never saw anyone yet that did not look simply and out of countenance whatever knew a wedding well designed but one and that was of two persons who time enough i confess to contrive it and nobody to please in avid themselves
the truth is i could not endure to be missus bride in a public wedding be made the happiest personal earth
do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather than fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
yet in earnest your father will not find my brother pate in wanting and civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters from me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set higher value upon her sister than she deserves
my aunt told me no longer gone in yesterday that i was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome tooke heed
you see i give you fell warning
by the next i shall be gone into kent m wh other journeys laid aside which i am not displeased at because it would have broken into course very much
here are some bosses of colonies tell me how you like them
i told you in my last that my suffer journey was made aside and that into kent hasten
if i drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will i bequeath all my kindness to you in it to a charge never to bestow it all upon another mistress lest my ghost rise again and haunts you
indeed i like him extremely and he has commended to me by people that know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than they i did not intend it so though i can assure you
i do not find it for i am told i was so extremely when i believed you love me
but i am called upon
directed for your master
i see you can kid when you please and with authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded from a very good principle in me
we dare not that our tongues lie more on one side of our mats and the other for fear of overturning it
you are satisfied i hope and this that i escaped drowning
but i am troubled much you should make so ill a journey to sore little purpose indeed i writ by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters
how welcome you will be but alas
for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to no de care an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission
they laugh to hear me say that one unkind word destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase every day if it were possible but never lesson
we go broad all day and play all night and say our praise when we at time
while and sober earnest now i would not live thus a twelvemonths to gain all that came has lost unless it were to give it him again
will you be so good nature
he has one son it is the finest boy that ere you saw and has a noble spirit but yet stands in that all of his father that one word from him is as much as twenty whippings
we must give me leave to entertain yoursel with discourses of the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
not to knowing you would come home i can assure you nor for any other cecy on my own but with a cousin of my that had long designed to make herself sport with him and did not miss off her aim
in my life i never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and nor old woman who passes for witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
ever since this adventure i have had s greater belief in all things for this nature that i could not forbear laying a peas caught with nine peas ins under my door yesterday and was informed by it that my husband's name should be thomas how you like that
she put her head down turned his gat back put her feet on the fender and took parting into her lap all of its arrangements signified that something very important had got to be thought over and settled
the more propose was the more credited
afterward it unlighted and maybee desist the consequence of that night's fun
just suppose it is true that he does ask me and irish yes
what a spiteful thing i among
i should do so much for all at home how i should him ty that
that me see how can i begin
he has known her all her life and has a good influence over her
now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that week for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided she missed the pleasant little interviews that used to put a certain flavour of romans into her dar hot working days
i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that knows attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected
it was that indescribable something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been pressed with wise and good mothers
this had an especial charm to polly for she soon found that sight of his character was not shown to everyone
lately this had changed especially towards parley and it flowed home more than she would confess even to herself
at first she tried to think she could that unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even gratitude
party felt a very cordial friendship for mister sydney but not one particle of the love suf the only kind in which laugh can mutually paid
this finished polly's indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with the spies of the old eve in her composition
when sata they came polly started as usual for visit to back he and best but couldn resist stopping at the shores to leave a lily passive of fen that was calling time
a foolish little speech to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tender hearted girl trying to her duty
take hold of massa charley's hand miss maybe and wal pudgy like willie and flossie said the mate
at a street corner a black eyed school boy was parting from a rosy faced schoolgirl whose music wall he was reluctantly surrendering
how he got there was never very clear to puny but there he was flushed and a little out of pip but looking so glad to see her till she had not the heart a buff and cool as she had fully intended to be when they met
she really could not help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
that is the way acre to the wass answered polly
she did not mean to tell but his frankness was so agreeable she forgot herself
but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she choices to mend her thoughts though she won't own it and hell surprise you some day by the amount of heart and sense and goodness she has got
thank you no
her lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
as the out ful young man laying a trap into which polly immediately fell
he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being both wild ingenuous resolved to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as para as his own
so and you made a last buoyant remark he said quietly watching your face keenly all the while i thought so well i'm going out of towne and business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me annoyed
she thought she had a good deal of the coquette in her and i have no doubted with time and draining she would have become a very dangerous person but now she was far to transpire forwards by nature even to tell a white like lovely
he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first in perhaps the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and except lien servants
parley did not return to her favourite walk till she learned for minnie that uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the ways so pleasant after all
budging two and for as usual what's the news with you
perhaps she o showed him
utterly done with and laid upon the shelf
minnie said the other day she reached she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the bottles and not firs above rebs
now don't be affected polly but just tell me like a dea has not he proposed
don't you think he means to
truly truly fan
i don't mean to be prying but i really thought he did
oh i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have
i just gave him a hint and he took it
he meant to go away before that so d think his heart is broken or mind what city sutlers say
he understood and being a gentleman made no farce
but parry it would have been a grand thing for you
i'm not you know i prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days
never mind what the business was its surfaces to say that it was a good beginning for young men like town who having been born in read in the most conservative class of the most conceded city in near england needed just the healthy hearty social influences of the rest to widen his views and make a man of him
fortunately everyone was so busy with the necessary probations that there was no time for romans of any sort and the four young people worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not bottled up in their respective hearts
pity that the ech had come so soon but the hour did its work and rend its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind but the young fogs did not see it them for their eyes within because of the partings that must be
if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a summer on towns but sydney often called till his vacation came and a voluminous class bonds of parley beguiled belong days
time were at once a week to his mother but the letters were surely not very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women bess liked to hear
no i'm only tired had a good deal to do lately and the dull weather mix me chest a twelve blue
forgive me polly but i can't help saying it for is there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can
aoi never deceive myself but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me
thank heaven for that
cried polly with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice
poor parley was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say
none by needed her heeld her face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish bostichi and the hundreds are after it
once or two ice but sort of chokingly and i thought it was only some real flirtation
it was lust you could of me not a guess before
it was so tender earnest and defiant but fanny forgot the defense of her own lover and admiration of police loyalty to hers for this faithful all absorbing laugh was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friend's boast of two or three lovers a year un calculate their respective fairies with almost as much coolness as the young men discussed fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to marry
i hope maria baileys only thinks she added softly for i could not bear to happen disappointed again
said fanny turning hope for all at once
suppose i say a word to tom just inquire after his heart in a general way you know i'm give him a chance to tell me if there's anything to tell
bear it people always do play things somehow answered polly looking as if sentence have been passed upon her
it was a very different window from the last were both the girls
i fanny wanted to show him what she could do towards making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded b than she suspected by in spite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mister sidney at least for he was more the house friend than ever and seemed determined approve the change of fortune made no difference to him
she kept much at home when the day's work was done finding it pleasanter to dreaming of a book or soon alone than to exert herself even to go to the shores
polly was not at all like herself that window and those newest to her saw and wounded at it most
for ned was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole baily question and left them in other darkness
fanny came bugging in the pony one day looking as if she bou tidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them
but if work baskets were gied with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any reread
she had even been in society before the revolution
it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext
every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monseigneur saint francois gave it to monseigneur sa julian monseigneur saint julian gave it to monseigneur saint eusebius monseigneur saint eusebius gave it to monseigneur saint procopius et cetera et cetera
and the schoolgirls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under the veils charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers from
it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
the rule of fervent did not forbid this
she would not show the subject tow anyone
thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were on occupied or born in the convent
some unique chaplet some authentic relick
they lost themselves in conjectures
when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making an effort to fly but the dancer is laughing with a satanic air
moral love conquered by the colic
the prioress returned and seated herself once more hon youre
we will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability
father f rent
reverend mother do you know the chapel
and you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties two or three times
there is a stone to be raised heavy
the slab of the pavement which is at the sid of the altar
the slap which closes the vault yes

it was mother pris fiction
three years ago madame de bassoon at jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen mother crucifixion a pair ah
the mothers have taken her to the dead room which opens on the church i know
a fine sight it would be to see a man enter the bedroom more often
fay more often
what you say

wherever another i did not say more often than watch i said more often
but i did not say more often
at that moment nine o'clock struck
at nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours praised and dured be the most holy sacrament of the altar said the press
it cut more often short
fu washy not marked his forehead
in her lifetime by the crucifixion made comforts after her death she will perform miracles she will
father prevent the community has been blessed in mother p's fiction
she retained her consciousness to the very last moment
she gave us her last man's
if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in herself she would have cured your leg merely by touching it she smiled
there was something of paradise in that death
fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing
fauchelevent held his peace she went on
i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit
fortunately the prioress completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it
she continued further for m
yes rem mother
saint terentius bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides in the hope that passers by would spit on his tomb this was done

where into the vault
fauchelevent shirted the vault under the altar
under the altar but
you will have an iron bar yes but
you will raise the stone with the borrow by means of the ring but
the dead must be obeyed to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother crucifixion
she asked it of us that is to say commanded us
but it is forbidden
oh i am a stone in your walls
think father for v if she were to work miracles here
what a glory of god for the community and miracles issue from tombs
but reverend mother is the agent of the sanitary commission
but the commissary of police
sono de mer one of the seven german kings who entered amongst the galls under the empire of contentious expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion that is to say beneath altar
the world is nothing in the presence of the cross
martin the eleventh general of the carthusians gave to his order this device stat crew doom ful ter orbes
the priors who is usually subjected to the barrier of silence and whose rather war was over full rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away

no one doubts the right of the monastery two sepulture
only fanatics and those an error deny it
we live in times of terrible confusion
we are ignorant and impious
and then regin is attacked why
because there have been bad priests because sag tar bishop of gap was a brother of salon bishop of embrued both of them foiled mammon
they persecute the saints
they shut their eyes to the truth darkness is the rule
the most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind
oh how wicked people are
by order of the king signifies today by order of the revolution
one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead a holy death is prohibited
gaire bishop of salon held his own in this matter against oho duke of burgundy

general observations on preserves confectionery ices and dessert dishes
the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for except a sugar is used in considerable qualities the success is very uncertain
fut gathered in weather fog you weather will sue be mildred and be no service for preserves
but to distinguish these properly replies very great attention and considerable experience
if you dip the finger into the serf and plight to the thumb the tenacity of the serve will on separating the finger and thumbs afford ah thread which shortly breaks this is the little thread
rent it boil up again then take it off and remove carefully the scum that is risen
it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil
before sugar was these honey was employed a person many vegetable productions though this substance was now human lat to the juice of the sugar cane
fourteen n d nye
bore them up three days successively stemming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use
the reason that ef is emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is that the ancle of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
from this example the process of preserving fruits by sirup would be easily comprehended
they should be dried in the stove or oven on a seas and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they turned
in this way it is also that orange and woman ships are preserved
marmalades james and fruit paste are the same nature and are now in they general quest
marmee and jams differ little from each other their preserves of half liquid consistency mad by boiling a pulp of fruits i am sometimes part of the lines with sugar
that they may keep it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen o three
in all the operations for preserved making when the preserving pan is used as should not be placed on the fire but on a tribute unless the jim was made on a hot plate when this is not necessary
confectionery fifteen o eight
in speaking of confectionery should be remarked that all the various preparations above named calms strictly speaking under that head for the various flutes flowers herbes and juices which one board with sugar were formerly employed in pharmacy as well as sweetmeats were called confections from the latin word comfable up but the term confectionery embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary cuisine
a thousand and one ornamental dishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should re purchase from the confectioner they cannot profitably be made in home
however as late as the reign of our two last george's fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts
the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems
ices
at desserts or at some evening parties ices are scarcely be dispensed with
the s battle is generally made of copper kept bright and clean
they should be taken immediately after the repast or some hours after because the taking of these substances dulling the process of digestion is apt to provoke indisposition
there was once on aimee a widower who had a sodden and a daughter by his first wife
from the very daid the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the man's children and not a corner to be found that they could get any rest so the boy thought that the best thing he could do was to pill into the world and try to oar his own bread
but his sister who was still at home fared towards and worse
tis me go said bad
when the king entered and saw he stood still as if he were in fetters and could not stir from the spot but the picture seemed to him so beautiful
these promised to make all the haste he could and set forth from the time's palace
at last they came in sight of land
while if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her casket into the sea
what is my brother saying asked his sister again
on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchenmaid who slept there to lend her a brush
she begged very prettily and got it and then she pushed her hair and the gold dropped from it
out on the ugly bushy brides sleeping so soft by the young king's side on sand and stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with the cold snake unpitied and
i shall come twice more and then never again said she
this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she slid the bell gout three times and one day dawned she departed but if she was going she said as she had said the floor i shall come once more and then never again
no one can tell how the light of the king was to get rid of that hideous bushy bride and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as day itself
wilt th serve me and what my seven fools as the king
the youth thought that it was very easy word to wash the folds and he could do it well enough
hast thou watched faithfully and well the whole day long said the king when the lad came into his presence in the evening
yes that i h said the youth
he had gone out once to seek a place he said but never would he do such a thing again
the necking promised him the same punishment and the same reward to fear polished his brother
when he had run after the fools for a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by clef in a rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with the distaff and she called to him
come hither come hither my handsome son and let me comb your hair
the youth liked the thought of this let the hold where where they chose and seated himself in the cuff of the rock by the side of the old hag
so then he sat with his head on her lap taking his ease the livelong day
on the third day set the lad wanted the set ache
the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go but all to no purpose when cinder lad set out on his way
i'm marking about and so to a place said silver lad
i would much rather have the princess said cinder lad
and thus they journeyed onwards a long long way
when they had gone thus for a long long way be full again or us dost thou see anything now
yes now i see something of his wife hits in the lad
it looks like the chalk of a great thick birch tree
signor lad tried but could not do it so he had to take a drop from the pitcher and then one more and after that still another and then he was able to be over sword with perfect ease
for we are brothers said the princess whom thou art to have when thou canst tell the king what we eat and drink but there is a mighty tool whose hast to spell over us
when they had telled a long long way the fall said dost thou seem any thing
and now quiet the foole sus th nothing now
now though said the fool dost thou not seen anything now
that is oliver said the full and we have to cross it
i have done my best replied single lad
once upon a time there was a king in the north hope one many wars but now he was old
the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
so yes the queen how do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning and she said
then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
he is no bigger than other dragon said the tutor and if you were as brave as your father you would not fear him
then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dwarf who waned all the treasure and took it from him
al the one ring was left which the dwarf wore and even that was taken from him
so regan made a sword and sigurd tried it with a blow and a lump of iron and the sword broke
then sigurd went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's blaye and gave them to regan
so sigurd said that sword would do
then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley
but sigurd waited till half of him it called over the pit and then he thrust the sword graham right unto his very heart
sigurd said i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
but all men die and no brave man let's death frighten him from his desire
guy thou fafner and then staff died
then sicker grow back and met reeking and wigan asked him to roast fafner iss heart and let him taste of it
sissy could put the heart of fafner on m stake and roasted it
there's cigaret roasting fafner a's heart for another when he should taste of it himself and learn all wisdom
that let him do then ride over hen feld to the place where brim held sleeps
there must she sleep till thou comes for her waking rise up in ride for now sure she will swear the vow fearless of breaking
then he took the helmet off the head of the sleep red behold she was a most beautiful lady
then sigurd rode away and he came to the house of the king who had a fair daughter
lamborn hill's father told gunner that she would marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower and that they rode and gotter fit his horse at the flame but he would not face it
for one day when borne hilding gudrid were bathing born held weighted farther sou into the river and said she did that to show she was gundry superior
for her husband she said had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it
not long to wait he said till the bitter sword stands fast in my heart and thou will not live long when i am dead
lobsters and lawyers
when is a lobster not a lobster when it is a crayfish
this question in answer might well go into the primer of information for those who ciss infancy governed east for what is called a lobster in sin frisco is not a allsorts but a cry fish
the pacific crayfish how arises every purpose and while many content that its meat is not so delicate flavor as that of its eastern cousin the californian was strenuously insists and it is better but of course something must always be allowed for the patriotism of the calonna
a book could be written about this restaurant and that all would not be told for all its secrets never be known
it was here that most magnificent dinners were arranged it was here that extraordinary dishes were concocted by chefs of wool ry fame it was here that lobster lid newburgh reached its highest perfection and this is the recipe that was followed when it was prepared in the dor meng

king and selfish
one has to come to san francisco to partake of the king of shellfish the mammoth pacific crab
i say come to san francisco advisedly for while the crab is found all along the coast it is prepared nowhere so deliciously as ince san francisco
gobies passed with the fire and the little restaurant bearing his same and in charge of his widow in union s graven has not attained the fame of the old place
it is possible that she knows the secret of preparing crab as it was prepared in the gobies of before the fire but his proceeds would not descend to her
gobies perhaps do
take the meat of one large crab scraping all the back from the shell
soak to crab me in the share two eyes before cooking

heat this in a stew bit and went shivering at the sherry and crab me and let all coo together with the slow fire for eight minutes

lobster in miniature
so far has been mused mostly for garnish ment of other dishes and it is only recently that the ho brow has been making the speciality of them
all the better class restaurants however will serve them you order them

this of cloth
take thirty a craw dish from which remove the gut containing the gall in the falling manner take firm hold of the crawfish with the left hand so as to avoid being pinched by its cloths with the thumb and farthing of the right hand pinch the extreme end of the central fin of the tail and with a sudden jerk the gut will be withdrawn

i swear answered sancho
by say so continued don quixote because i hate taking away anyone's good knee
i say replied sancho that i swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship stays and gon grat i may be able to let it out tomorrow
though your worship was not so badly on having in your arms comparable beauty you spoke of but i would i have except the heaviest wax that i think i had in all my life
unlucky me and the mother at bob
didn't i see so worse luck to my line said sancho
it cannot be the more answered don quixote but those under enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone
if they do not let themselves be seen they let themselves be felt said sancha if not let my shoulders speak to the point
my c speak too said don quixote but that is thought a suspicious reason for believing that what we see is he enchanted more
the officer turned room and said well how goes a good man
sancho got up with pain enough in his bones and went after the in cup in the dark in meeting the officer who was looking to see what have become of his enemy he said to him senor whoever you are do us the favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary oil salt and white for it is water to cure one of our best nights errant on earth who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted more than is in this in
to be breathe he took the mats of which he made a compound mixing them on boiling them a good while it until it ceded to him they had come to perfection
sancho panza who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous begged him to give him what was let an epics which was no small quantity
don quixote consented and he taking it with both hands in good faith and with a better will broke down and drained a very little less than his master
if your worship knew that returned sancho won't betide me in all my kindred why did you let me taste him
search your memory and if you find anything of this kind you need only tell me of it and i promise you by the order of knighthood which i have received to procure you satisfaction in reparation to the utmost of your desire
then this is it in said don quixote
in a very respectable one said the innkeeper
the cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his master who appalling to listen tented to flee was persuaded that some new adventure was coming until he clearly perceived that it was his squire who uttered them
he saw him rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that had his rage aladdin is my belief he would have laughed
sancho took it and as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming sancho my son drink not water drinkin off my son for it will kill thee see here i had the blessed balsam and he held a pervasive liquor and with drinking two drops what thou wilt certainly be restored
the strides of a main man like the og glances of a one eyed man they do not reach their goal very promptly
cosette had waked up
jean valjean had paced him near the fire
you will wait for me at a lady's house i shall come to fetch ye
everything is ranged and nothing is said fauchelevent
i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
that's where the difficulty lies
it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out
and she will hold her tell me i answer for that
th givin grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean
you understand father madeline the government one notice it
jean valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving
fauchelevent went on
it is to morrow that i am to bring you in the prioress expects you
then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community
that the nun who had dined that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the fault under the altar of the chapel
that the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil wish of the deceased
that he fauchelevent was to nail up the coffin in the cell raised the stone in the chapel and blower the corpse into the vault
and then that there was another the empty coffin
what is that empty coffin
asked jan ra van fauchelevent replied
what coffin what administration
fauchelevent who was seated sprang up as though alma had burst under his chair you
you know for cheerful what you have said mother crease a fiction is dead
and i a and father madeline is buried r
you are not like other men saw the madeline
this offers the means but give me some information in the first place
how long is the coffin six feet
it is a chamber on the ground floor has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one leads into the convent the other into the church a what church
the church in the street of the church which anyone can enter
have you the kings to those too doors
and no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the draw which communicates with the che
only to allow the undertakers men to enter when they come to get the coffin
who nails up the coffin i do
who spreads the poor labour it
not another man except the police doctor can enter the bedroom that is even written on the wall
could you hide me in that ring to night when everyone is asleep
about three o'clock in the afternoon
i shall be hungry ahhh will bring you something
you can come and now me up in the coffin at two o'clock
fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger joints but that is impossible
bah impossible to take a hammer and drives nails in a pan
jean valjean had been worse straight th ms
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to conmee his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean's gloomy talents
you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nay on the top plank on loosely good and what if you should happen to car for to sneeze
a man who is making his escape does not cough all sneeze
who is there who is not said to a cat do come in
the over prudent cats as they are and because they are cant sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
but jean valjean's cornet prevailed over him in spite of himself he grumbled
if you are sure of coming out of the coffin aright i am sure of getting out of the grave
and ulv o of the old school the grey digger potts the corpses in the grave and i put the gravedigger in my pocket
i shall follow that is my business
there's halts the undertaker men not a rope around your coffin fir lower you dam
the priests as the prayers mates the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
one of two things will happen he will either be sob or he will not be sober
that is settled father fauchelevent all but go well
on the fallen day as the sun was declining the very rare passers by on the boulevard die men hild off their hats to an old fashioned hearse ornamented with skulls crass bones and tears
this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a hinge corpse with drooping arms
a morning coach in which could be seen a priest in his surplice and a choir boy in his red cap followed
behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer limped along
the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter in this cemetery they were subjected to a special discipline
these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalides
dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it
the bourgeoisie did not care much about being buried in the roger hard it hinted at poverty par lashes if you pleas
to be buried in pera chaise is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognized as elegant
the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the introduction of jean valjean into the deed room all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch let us robin in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly menial offence in our sight
it is one of the faults which resound on a duty
the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences
in the cloister what is called the government is only an intermeddling with authority an interference which is always questionable
make as many doors as you please men but keep them for yourselves
the prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind
jean valjean's composure was one of those powerful tranquillity which are contagious
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
he played with father misty n
he did what he lacked with him he made him dance according to his win
the permission for interment must be exhibited
he was a sort of labouring that who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm
the man replied the gray digger
the grave diner yes
you i
the father miss genes the brave digger he was
flushing of what had expected anything but this that a grave digger could die
it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do die themselves
he had hardly the strength to stammer
but he persisted feebly farther muster is the grave digger
do you know who l fatherland lyre he isn't job of red wine
but you are a jolly fears
are you not comrade we'll gun have a drink together present
the man replied
he limped more out of anxiety than from infinity
the gravedigger walked on in front of him
fauchelevent passed the unexpected courrier once more in review
fauchelevent who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
but sir father nest inne is dead
the man replied completely
the good god consulted his notebook which shows when the time is up it was farthermost young's turn for misti u died
stammered fauchelevent it is made
you are a peasant i am the parisian
fresh she war thought i am lost
there were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small ary leading to the nan's corner
and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well
fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter rains clog of the wheels and retarded its speeded
my father was a porter at the britonum ter hor
but he had reverses he had losses un change i was obliged to renounce the profession of author but i am still a public writer
but so you are not a grave digger then
returned fauchelevent clutching at this branch feeble as it was
here a remark becomes necessary
a fauchelevent was up his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
the greve digger went on with a superior smile
one must eat
the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake
yes but if i should already ask for something what
well do it for me for i swear to you thy don't love you as the others have loved you
there are bolts in the door wretch
i don't know how it is but it seems to nane if i do
thou go i can't keep my eyes open
it seems to me as if this sleeping city belongs to me i searched my memory for their names of those whose happiness i had once envied and i could not recall one without finding myself the happier
education manly feeling the sense of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sentinels so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first castle of love all the more ardent because they seem so pure
the more girl believes in goodness the more easily will she give way if not to her lover and these to love for be without mistrust she is without force and to w her love is a triumph that can be gained by any young man of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must they find it tempting how surely must be listened to the first voice which comes to tell it secrets through their bars and bless the hand which he is the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil
with them the body has worn out the soul the senses half burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
they loved by profession and not by instincts
when a creature who has all her pasts to reproach herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere irresistible love of which she had never felt herself capable when she has confessed her love how absolutely the man whom she loves dominates her
they know not to what proof to give
in order to disturb the labourers in the field was one day devoured by a wolf because those whom he had so often deceived no longer believed in his cries for help
this is the same with these unhappy woman would they loved seriously
but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough and soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one draught all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
but to return to the first day of my liaison
whenever reach home i was in the state of mad gaiety
the woman becomes a man's mistress and loves him
how why
my whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we exchanged during that first night
here on my orders tonight at a varville
condor the third and trap
the boxes filled one after another
only one remained empty as stage box
at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and marguerite appeared
did she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she lives the happier i should be
what is the matter with you to night said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
he should go to bed she replied with that ironic era which went so well with her delicate and witty face
where at home
you still love me can you ask
because she don't like seeing him
n the less i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and marvelling again into the carriage which was witting for them at the door
i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
you in the way marguerite but how
well you might have had a woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive
during this remark marguerite looked at me attentively
my dear prudence i answered you do not know what you are saying
yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
because i am watched in the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm
is that really the only reason
if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
on the slep you care for me a little a great feel
i fancied for a moment that i might give myself that happiness for sixth months you would not have it you insisted annoying the means
well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
i listened and i gazed that marguerite with admiration
when i thought that this marvellous creature whose feet i had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts by part in her life and that i was not yet content with what she gave me i asked if man's desire had indeed limits when spied as probably as mine had been it reached after something further
truly she continued we poor creatures of chance have fantastick desire and inconceivable loves
we are not allowed to have hearts and the penalty of being hooted down and of ruining our credit
we no longer belong to ourselves
we stand first in their self stained last in their steam
never do we give you advice which is not lucrative
it means little e off to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they get dresses or a bracelet out of them and that they can drive in our paris from time to time or come to our box at the future
such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and old ae neither protects nor consols
i thought i could upset the life which he offered me what would you have
what i loved and you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
marguerite hired out with this long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough pull up her the chief to her lips and from that to her eyes
marguerite do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but in the name of heaven tear up the letter which i wrote to you and did not make me leave you to morrow it would kill me
marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
here it is i have brought it back
i tore the letter into fragment and kissed with tears the hand i gave it me
look here prudence do you know what he wants said marguerite
he wants you forgive him
one has to but he wants more than that what then
i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled
old mister buzzard grinned
this sounded like another story
he was curious about that black headed cousin of all mister buzzard very curious indeed
anyway he would find out
please mister feler please tell us the story he begged
now all mister buzzard is naturally good natured and accommodating and when peter baggsed so hard he just couldn't find it in his heart to refuse

like most no count people he used to make a regular nuisance of his stuff poking his nose into everybody's business and never tending to his own

everybody looked at peter and laughed

one day this no count's trifling cousin of friend pop buzzard get cold in his feet
it was on the lower old house a little old tumble down house

but he don't mind that
won't you all please speak a little louder he hollered out o chimney jest like that
yes saw she showed he was plump scared
they liked to choke that no composer to death
when he get home he trot try to brush this suit off but it done get into the skin and stay there
a little sigh of satisfaction went round the circle of listeners
it was just as good as one of grandfather frogs
draw watch fill mixed give it me without water
so my friend so whip me off this glass neatly bring me heather some claret a full weeping glass till it run over

i am willing to enter into competition with the ancients and feel able to surpass them for since tho early days in which i made the medals of pope clement i have learned so much that i can now produce far better pieces of the kind i think i can also outdo the coins i struck for duke alessandro which are still held in high esteem in like manner i could make for you large pieces of gold and silver plate as i did so often for that noble monarchs king francis of france thanks to the great conveniences he allowed me without ever losing time for the execution of colossal statues or other works of the sculptor's crafty

now i hope to show them that i am an old sculptor if god shall grant me the boon of finishing my perseus for that noble piazza of his most illustrious excellency
having this excellent resolve in heart i reached my home
while there was rather surly after the ladies had floated away from the scene and he drank his liquor doggedly
it was his fancy i suppose to revive certain sentimental relations which had it may be once existed between him and miss lake and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnified an object in proportion as its pursuit is thwarted
the story of friedlin and wretch's pretty outlines

he assisted at it but took no part and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gabble in laughter like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance

but the king laughed him to scorn thou a sword equalled
in sooth thou shalt have one but it shall be one befitting thin made in size and courage yet so small a weapon can be found in all my kingdom
forthwith the grinning jester began sure reeking with laughter so that the bells upon his motley cap were all s a jangling
i did but laugh to think the sword of ethelried had been so quickly fouled responded the jester and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailor's girdle
one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near it hand in the bushes
thou shalt have thy liberty he cried even though thou shouldst run me in pieces the moment thou'rt free
yet had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful fairy with filmy wings which shone like rainbows in the moonlight
at this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten
scissors grow a giant's height and save us from the ogre's might
he could see the ogre standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the chasm and gnashing his teeth each one of which was as big as a mill still
the sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him
thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this dismal spot while i have the power to help thee
he lifted the scissors and with one stroke destroy the web and gave the flies it's read him
a faint glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole
the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors
as he uttered the words the scissors leaped out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shutters as easily as through it caves
in a very short time the prince had crawled to the opening
while he stood looking around him in bewilderment a firefly alighted down his heart flashing its little lantern in the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me to guy do to a place of safety
what has to become of me cried the poor peasant

he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn open with the iron in order that grain may be deposited within it it feels only the wound the quiver of the germ the joy of the fruit only arrived later
he th just acquire the faith must he then rejected already
he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
to stand between two religions from one of which you have not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to that like souls
marius was clear eyed and he required the true light
the half lights of doubt tamed him
whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
his discomfort was augment by all the reflections which occurred to him
in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
they soon elbowed him abruptly
request gog to come and talk with me said marius
what is to become of you said cur fac
what are you going to do i do not know
silver gold here it is
you will then have only a pair of trousers a waistcoat a hat and a coat and by boots
that will be enough
no it is not good what we do after that
you dow german no
it is badly paid work but one can live by it
the clots dealer was hent for
he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments they went to the watchmakers
he bought the watch for forty five francs
hello i've forgotten that said marius
the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot
i have ten francs left said marius
that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sous very slowly
one morning on his return from the lost school marys found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistol that is to say six hundred francs in gold in a sealed box
marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunts with the respectful letter in which he stated that he had suspicion means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs
at that moment he had three francs left
he perceived that it was no good talking to the old man and that the principal person in the house was the mother
before her he decides his scatter his pearls
the princess was distracted and did dot know what to do she felt she had sinned against k
well loch her decide our fate said the princess tell me everything
he's their hold she meant to say but her looks quivered and she could not outer the question well doctor
as he weighs the princess went out of the sigh
the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations
and there are indications metricians nervous excitability and so long
the question says thus the presence of indications of tu berg at this process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
yes sent an understood thing responded the celerity physician again glancing at his watch
beg pardon is the yuki abridge dana or shall have the drier on
he asked ah it is
oh well then i can do it in twenty minutes
and how bout it to her abroad asked the kelly doctor
what has wanted is the meaning improving nutrition enough lowering
the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
but in favor foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling e premiss
and then the mother wishes it he and
ah we'll not past to be sure let them go only those dram in quacks are mischievous
oh times up alway and he went to the duel
the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so that he ought to see the nation once more
oh no only a few dids princess come this way
and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing room to get
when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tears
she answered him and all at once got up furious
excuse me doctor but there is really no logic in this
this is the third toime you've asked me the same thing
the celebrated doctor did not take offence
nervous irritability he said to the princess when she had left the room however i had finished
and the doctor began signed difficulty explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which was certainly harmless
at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged in the deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem
finally his decision was b nussed they were to go abroad but to put no faith in foreign quacks and to apply to him in any need
it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had young
the mother was much more cheerful as she went back to her daughter and kitty pretended to be more cheerful
educated people of the upper places are trying to stifled ever brewing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social war
this is absolutely indirect
in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the enters of the group
the champions of the social conception of life usually trying to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
the man who is controlled by moral influence acts an accordance with his own desires
the basis of authority is bodily wilds
the possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison and submission to one will
these bands of armed men said missus to a single will are accosted the army
the army has always been and still is the basis of power
power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything in court popularity of the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
indeed it could not be otherwise
only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
but since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
even if there was on a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition amen of violence the existence of authority to restrain such balance was an advantage because the violence of the government was less than the violence of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strait between the individual seem still less and a life of the state seems even more secure
it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle and agent
after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
but this justification is never more than temporary
internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression deserted by the authority over the dissentient individuals
governed authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
and therefore the oppression of the oppress always goes on growing up the furthest woman beyond which it cannot k about killing the goose with golden nice
the most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest
so it h always been
footnote the fact that in america the uses of authority exists in spite of a small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position be positively confirms it
the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer belong on incitants men they feel that this purity of their position depends on the increase drink of the army
the reason to which he gave expressions essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the popes engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of the day so carefully distributed the recruits so that the regiments from the frontier their stationed in central districts and the regiments from the center are stationed on the frontiers
the meaning of privy speech put into plain language is that fund are needed not to resist foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the enslave toiling masses
and this abnormal order of thanks is maintained by the army
but there is not only one goverment there are other governments exporting their such as by violent in the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its enslave subjects
and so every government needs an army also to protect its body from its neighbor brigands
this increases contagious as montesquieu pointed out hundred fifty years ago
every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defence against its subjects becomes a sort of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
the despotism of the government always increases with the strength of the army and as external successes and the aggressiveness of the government increases with its internal despotism
the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse the universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers who obtained at the least possible express
and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practised upon them all citizens have become their own impress
this inconsistency has become obvious and universe in the thord service
in fact the whole significant of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitory of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life the groups of persons
but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had meant to avoid
but instead of doing that they exposed the individual to the same necessity of strife suit duties strike with individuals of other states for strife with neighbours
the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the graver part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
the danger of war ever ready to break out winners all reforms of lie social like vain and fruitless
but the feat significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defence but that is not true
they are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an accomplice in all that acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
and for the sake of what are i making them
i am expected for the sake of a state to make the sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
except with the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number that that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence
so that this justification of stayed violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil suppose persons even if it had some foundation three of four centuries ago has none whatever now
except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means a communication in so em
without the state men would not have been able to form a social institutions needed for doing anything
this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in formed societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
without governments nations were be inlaid by their neighbors
the government they tell us with its army is necessary defend us from neighboring states who might enslave us
and if defence against barbarous nations its meant one thousandth part of the troops now under ars would be amply sufficient for that purpose
the power of the state are from beings security against the attacks of our neighbours exposes u on the contrary the much greater danger of such a tax
even looking at it practically weighing that is to say all the burdens laid on him by the states no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with the state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantages than to refuse to do so
to resist would need independent thought and efforts of which every man is not capable
so much for the advantages disadvantages of both lines of conduct for a man of a wealthy class and oppressor
for a man of the poorer working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages
say you know supper
chris looked for medical plated flash like to a car jack can spark plug
no one you's a jump ban that's kinky harris
o kay he said
only why didn't you ask em yourself
mike became uneasy and fished and elastic band out of his pocket made a flink of paper and sent it soaring out in em street
well he admitted i did
chris asked and for the first time that day the heavy weight he carried within him lifted and lightened little
think he really means it in pursuit
he would have liked to get the job for jakie who needed it but somehow a task of facing mister wicker especially now that the light was going in dusk edged into the streets was not what christen intended for ending the afternoon
mike's expression changed in one wants to w of triumphs but brisk was only partially encouraged
a pitcher and going after all this turned tow him
might was standing on the corner
ah shocks
chris star it off once more passing a bleak little victory and church perched on the hill of mister work's house
an empty lot cut int into by church lane gave a look of isolations of ale shap brick building that sir mister wicks both house in place of business
no longer wing towards the back on back door that opened on a water street the space between the house and wisconsin adieu had been made into a neat up along flower garden fenced off for the sidewalk by box shrugs and the white picket fence
a livid yellow staining the horizon beyond the factories inlay clouds lowered and tumbled above
the air was growing chill and christened to finish the job
all at once he wondered how his mother was and everything at him him pinched and tightened itself
at the foot of the hill he reached the house
there were three things that always caught his eye emin the litter of dusty pieces
otto left the coil of rope in the center the model of a sailing ship in a grain glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of the negro boy in baggy trousers turkish jacket and white turban
but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe at home in bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabelle
he had never seen anyone go into mister wicker's shop now he thought of b
how then did he lamp and what did he ever sell
a sudden car horne walking from his dream
and the many times he had damned mister whiffs window and poured over the rope the ship and the nubian boy he had never gone into mister hooker's shop
some now alone till someone should answer the bell they looked eagerly yet uneasily around him
but with one window in the lowering day outside the long narrow shop with sombre
had the hand une beams crossed it from one side to the other
mister walker's back being towards the source of light chris could not see his face
the double fans and minute wrinkles breaking from eye quartered a temple and joining with those over the sheep bones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead
lintel top's of white funds above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarians hair but what drew and held chris's gaze with the old man's eyes
crisp linked and looked again yes they were still there
chris swallow it his vice came back him
y is sir he said
i say your signet i know boy who eats the job
he's a schoolmate of minion
jenie er's name is new reeling is the job
i i just wondered if the place waster lop and
what he saw was a fresh cheap lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humour in his face and something spited an appealing about his eyes
and guess there must be a lively fire in that room beyond
with that him fear with jakie gigs gidding the job sir
but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his minds why d he not seem the reflection of the headlights at the cars moving ab up around the crier of wall utter street not hill towards the rapid signals
the rome seemed overly still
then in that second return and faced about
the wide bow wind it was there before him and three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that to it in from across of water
grist the water where was the free way
it was no longer there nor were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen to
the warehouses were still there
flabbergasted and breathless tis was unaware that he had moved closer to peer out the window in every direction
no electric signs no lapt streets
when the people's stroke store and stood but half an hour before rose the ruse of what was evidently an inn
at courtyard his firstly met by flaring torture too showing a swinging sign hung on the post
the posts blooded at the edge of it was now a broad and money row and
the coach with it stopped piled high with lugged stamped to a halt beside the flat court card
they moved it to the end the coach rattled off to the stable
my window has a power for those few who are to see
the learning of magic was by no means easy
he had told his master at once he bot simon goesler his hoard of money his hiding places for it
chris therefore threw himself and of all the primaries in his task
one afternoon when he had returned after arst to mister winkle's study he saw that there was something new in the room a ball with a gold fish in it stood on the table but mister wicker was not to be seen
what should al u do first
how you've reproved my boy he exclaimed it is now time for you to try missus h gutta change any
suppose i changed and kat caned back
mister wicker waited patiently beside and for a few moments for chris to get up his courage
that has nothing happened with a voice like a whip mister rickards start at once
a sensation spread faster and faster
his head swab and he felt faint a little sick but he persisted through the final words
he thought n without a feeling of pride and commenced the experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight at some little time elapsed before mister wicker's voice bloomed bows by
seventy four book one the return
the figure's shoes carved in some eastern style a curved up pointing toes
that all at once the idea came to chris
if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
he squatted on his haunches examined the carved wooden figure intently and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion
but how did one change inanimate to animate
chris got up and stole back to mister wicker's door
he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his broom above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was reeling empty with sur june's proper shape and open the doors of the cupboard at the far end of the room
the afternoon raining before increased in storm
thus came two hours before its time thunder snarled in the sky
certain elements were to be mixed and poured the proper time
mister worker began moving about upstairs the full boards creaked c way and still chris could not leave until the potion fumed and glowed
with infinite caution chris closed the door silently behind him in running light be forward breached the figure the negro boy
it was as if the stiffness melted
under his eyes whistled fold of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its rounding upon the coat and oh the face
the wind grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of car flowers moved a the bouquet ful
they went down to their corners first
guess mister finney went to his quarters i don't remember seeing him cross the tack or come over that way at all
next ned cilley was reining to the helm by ober jones you took over ned went on down
it looks to me as if it could been one of several people and i'll be switched if i know who will give my eyes open
the mirabelle was nearing titty
we've bought her and fresh stalls to take old mare
chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin
certainly my boy boomed out the captain as blue eyes abruptly keen and penetrating
mister finney would be some time on deck we cannot be own heard in here
his face rose with nervousness that this might do o do was in answer and he stood stiff and stone before captain lizards
the captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say that i do
the ship had more to me than wife or mother all family
and pause fingering his lower lip looking sideways in reflective fashion at chris standing before him
we shall say no more but i trust you understand the responsibility you have
the ship its cargo and its men will be in your hands
yes sir i think i can do it safely or i should not try sir
captain lizard's round pink faced creased in its winning smile
he then went on to descry what else was to father the covering in the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
the camouflage was not a word the captain or anyone else of his time he had understood
what can be said during that time sir chris thought to ask
i am somewhat skills in meditates i have to be as a captain of ship and crew know it
i shall say that you are in my own cabins as i can care for you
not since he had left mister wicker and chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
he knew now that his absence for as long as he had had to be away would be covered up and satisfaction inly accounted for
their conversation had taken some of a while
one churchyards yon
i knew well enough that he might be carried thousand miles in box scar lopped in perhaps without water or full
i am sure i kissed lady and i've had terrible moments since when i seemed remember kissing mister jameson too with excitement
fortunately war on the detect to we keeping bachelor holland lodge
hour of derest lady they washed her dishes weil today and they concord queer messes according to their several abilities
miss eames he said stopping me as i was about to woe my room upstairs how are your nerves to night
i have none i said happily
i mean he persisted you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual
the most unusual thing i can't think of would be a pul night
something is going to occur he said
put on heavy shoes and some old our clothes and nec up youre mind not be surprised at anything
livy was sleeping sleep of the just when i went upstairs and i hunted out my things scabious
they were chucking confidently together but when they came down they ceased
there were few preparations to be made the locks to be gone over winters to instructive as to renewed vigilance and then after extinguishing the hall light we crept in darkness through front door and into night
i asked no questions
was only somebody spoke and then it was an emphatically the profanity from doctor steward when he run into a wire fence
i alin know what i expected
the doctor was puffing somewhat where we finally came to a halt
i confess that just at that minute even sunnyside simple cheerful spot
in spite of myself a dreamed breath and sharply
it was alex on the two long handled spades
the doctor kept the kin look out but though u appeared
there's one thing sure i'll not be suspected of complicity

they yet had taken themselves to their work i less divert my mind than to deprecate conversation at provided myself with a book

she colored began excessively and remained silent pressing her finger against her cheese and gazing into the fire
i watch her a few moment to the feeling of malevolent gratification then moving tows the door a calmly as if she had anything more to say

she paused in evident disconcert and perplexity mingled anger she dared not show
i cannot renounce that his dearer den life sh muttered in a low harried tone

the keith my basking fact was at that moment in love and the others were attached to it
now then sneered he we must have a cough the skating of property
and put in a keys into his park he walked into the library
that and oh replied master and things were cleared away

here bason entered the candles and there followed the brief interval of silence i sitting stealing my chair and he standing with his back to the fire found the trying thing in my despair
i know that day after day such feelings return up on me
i try to look to him and rut my heart your haven but it youll cliff to the dust

miss and missus huts have been saying it to grow a fortnight and as missus hargrave still absent and weather was remarkably fine i never passed a day without seeing my two friends milton an asser either there are here

never mind my plain speaking said i it is from the best of motives
but tell me should you wish your sounds to be like mister hunted and are even like yourself
oh no eklan stand that
far and fury
now don't force into a tempest to dead
but hanged it as not my fault
not years for she is only five and twenty
what did you make of me and the children to be sure that were he hurt death between them
i know they are bless them
he fell of mean to the library
i sought how and put into his hands stew of mills and slats wand did it from london and written during one of his wildest seasons of recipes the other in the country during a lucid interval
the former was full of trouble and anguish not accusing him but keep the regret in his connection with his profligate companions abusing mister grim's be and others insinuating bitter things against mister humping and most ingenuously throwing the blame of her husband's misconduct on the other man's shoulders
i've an a cursed rascal god knows said he as he gave it a earth discreet but you see if i don't make a mans for it then me if i don't
if intent we form evoke god's blessing is mercy in this ape nor discourse
god help me then for i am sure i may it
was milicent

mliss and flew to thank me overwhelming if gratitude
cried she i can't have influenced him i'm sure by anything that i could have said
you never tried me merely said he
after that they were prepared to their country home
captain lake did not look at on like a london dandy now
there is a very natural savagery and dejection there and a wine yard in his yellow eyes rachel sat down
a slave or anything a slave
or frightful frightful is it a dream
all frightful frightful
stanley stanley it would be mercy to kill me she broke her again
bright and matty with the chintz curtains and the little toilet set out not inelegant and her pet pied pink goldfinch asleep on his perch with a bit of sugar between the wires of escape pillow so white and unpressed with its little edging of lace
when he came back to the drawing room a toted bottle of o the glow in his hand with her lace handkerchief he bathed her temples and forehead
there was nothing very brotherly in his look as he peered into a bale sharp features during the process
there don't mind me she said sharply and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle he had just sat down and went swiftly to her room
and she threw back her view and going hurriedly to the dolt mechanically survey herself from the glass
racy latently what are you know
i'll stay here that is in the joining room she answered and the face was withdrawn
he slackened the space and tapped sharply at the little window of the madest post office at which the younger ladies in the pony carriage had pulled up the day before and within which look rabbit was wonted to sleep in a sort of wooden box that folded up and appeared to be a chest of drawers all day
luke took care of mister larkin's dogs and groved mister wylder's horse and cleaned up his door cart for marking close about money and finding that the thing was to be done more cheaply that way put up his horse and door cart in the post office premises and so aerated the livery charges of the brandon arms
the luke was now there and captain lake recollecting his habits and his haunt hurried on to the silver lion which has its cable towards the common only about a hundred steps away for distances are not great in joying den
here were the flow of soul and of stout long pipes long yarns intolerably long credits and the humber cave races of the town resulted thither for the pleasures of a club life and often revelled deep into the small hours of the morning
lose no time when i give you half a crumb
luke stuck on his greasy wide a week and in a few minutes more the dark cart was trundled out into the limb and the horse harnessed went between the sharps with that wonderful cheerfulness with which they bar to be called up and the startling circumstances and unseasonable hours
if i thought your thing me now tamar i should never come back good night tamar
the acts said that in is of difference of opinion there must be about
he went up to the table and striking it with his fingering he shouted loudly a ballad
he was shouting for the very course sergey even of which had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and growed in o opposition to it the same indica ness though in a more seemly fall on the other side
shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order a ballad
we shed out blood for our country
the confidence of the monarch with no shaking the accounts of the martian he is not of cashier but that's not the point
votes please peace
they expressed the most implacable hatred
levin did not in the least understand what was a matter and he marvelled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about flare off should be put to the vote
he forgot as sir given explained to him afterwards this sledges that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province but to get into the martian it was necessary to have a majority of wards that to get a majority of boards it was necessary to secure fur's right aboute that to secure the recognition of flerov write bot they was decided on the interpretation to be put on the act
but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement
to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the freshman bar
he particularly liked the way one bay whiskered waiter who showed us gone for the other younger was and was dured at by them was teaching them how to fold of napkins properly
levin advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to sojer ivanovitch with the question where de marya put it
so you ivanovitch frowned
that is a matter for each man's own decision he said severely
having put it in he recollected that he ought have thrust his left hand too and so he thrust it though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background
a hundred and twenty sixth for admission ninety eight against
sang what the voice of the secretary who could not place a letter are
then there was a laugh a button and two knots were found on the box
but the old party did not consider themselves conquered
in replies mid cod spoke of the trust and noblemen of the province had placed to him the of fatal they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service
this expression in the marshal's face was particularly touching to levin because only the day fore he had been at his house about his trusty business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kind hearted fatherly man
if there are men younger and more deserving than i let themselves
and the marshal disappeared through a side door
they were to proceed immediately to the election
two noble gentleman who had a weakness was strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of snetkov and a third had been robbed of his uniform
un learning this the new party had made haste during the disputant frere off to send some of their men in his sledge to clothed the stripped gentlemen and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting
lenin did not care to eat and he was not smoking he did not horn to join his own friends that is search ivanovitch stepan arkadyevitch sviazhsky and the rest because vronsky in an equerry uniform was staring with them in eager conversation
he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being s around him
he such a blank card
i have told him so but it makes no difference all i think of it
these portions were unmistakably seeing of place where they could talk about being overheard
shall we go on your excellency find champagne
lustre and a district martial nicolai images
oh still just the same always are a loss the landowner answered with a resigns mind but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be
why what is there to understand
there's no meaning in it at all
then too one must keep off connexions
it's a model obligation of a sort
and then to dol gude there's one's own impress
their proprietors of a sot but we are the landowners
that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
and we are laying out a garden clowning one before the house you know and there you have a tree that stood the centuries in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you don't cut down the old fellow to make home for the flower beds but lay out your beds so as to take advantage the shay
well and how is your land doing
but one's work a thor in for nothing
oh well one do what would you have
and once more the landowner went on leaning his elbows on the window and chapping on my son i must ely has no days for it
so there will be no one to keep it out and yet one dot
we walked about the fields and the garden no said he step on mis livid everything's well looked after but your gardens neglected
to mind thinking i'd got down the lundy
here your thousands of lines and each would make two good bottles a bark
your married i hood said the lander
yes it's job as strange he went on
the land on had chock and under his white e mustaches
why don't we cut down our box for t mum
said levin but doling to a thought that i'd struck him
there's a class instincts to of what one ought and ought not to do
there's the peasants too i wonder of them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
without a return too as a simple loss
when he came from the bath process visited him again
but hermon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honour of the seventieth birthday of the old sculptor euphrates
she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour
so the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition
the banquet was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing daphne and telling her the words of the oracle
he longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescue demeter might yet be the work of merciless had again mastered him
the approval as well as a doubts which had arise in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing into harmony with the facts
then he went directly to the neighbouring palace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered and impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy
when hermann entered the residence of the grammaticus in the palace the guests had already assembled
the place by hermann's side which alphy had chosen for herself would then be given up to arsenal
true an interesting conversation still had power to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight and referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyments blindness debarred him
a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and women to whom no tad bound him save the presence of the same host
creates had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair haired n co had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing arsenals praises among his professional associates
his son had been the royal dame's first husband and she had deserted him to marry l snakes the aged king of thrace
the king's sister the object of his love cried herman incredulously
we woman are only as old as we look and the leeches entiring woman of this beauty of forty practice odds which give her the appearance of twenty five yet perhaps the king values her intellect more than happen and new wisdom of a hundreds serpents is certainly united in this woman's head
the three most trustworthy ones i here amyas the liege chrysippus in the admirable proces
let us hope you will make this three leaved clover the luck promising four leaved one
your uncle too has often with praiseworthy generosity helped aught know in many an embarrassment
how long he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the whole city with delight
when he did finally semen you he fed things which must have wounded you
that is going too far replied hermann
he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arsenal had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in roads
the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and alethea eagerly confirmed the statement
her marm into the parent silence
the rodion was just beginning to praise arsenal also as a special friend and connoisseur of the sculptures art when crates hermon fellow student asked the blind artist and behalf of this beautiful companion while his demeter was placed upon a pedestal which to others as well as himself seemed too high for the size of the statue
yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of squally at him
a woman who earns for the regard of all men and makes love a toy easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals
only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and anthea did not wish to lose hermann's regard
how indifferent you look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you were still a genuine creating oddest the case was different
though so loud a denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no idle delusion and snows me i can prove
it was nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
not a sound if you value your lives
to offer resistance would have been madness for even hermon perceived by the loud clanking of weapons round them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prisoner the place of execution
was he to be led to the executioner's block
what pleasure had like to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art
ought he not to greet his sudden end as a boom from immortals
did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be imagined
whatever might await him he desired go better fate
if he had passed into annihilation he hermon wished to follow him thither an annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
but if he were destined to meet his virtuous and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not tell them how sure he was a finding a joyful reception there from both
the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was non nemesis no it was a kindly deity
yet it was no illusion that deceived him
again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
sometimes with the touching entreaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate a mistake
lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philippicus her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
cried herr mod and grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and follow the soldier whom the captain detail to guide her into the palace
to morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path
daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philip's silence char with a grave exclamation the order of the king
as soon as the captive artist was alone with a woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forwards incoherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly returned the pressure he could not restrain the desire to cross perch with heart
in spite of his deep mental distress he could have shouted aloud in his delighting gratitude
he might now have been permitted to find forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the poles the following morning still sealed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought not to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impulse he exclaimed you know that i love you
i love you and have loved you always
daphney exclaimed tenderly what more it's needed
but hermon with drooping head murmured to morrow i shall no longer be what i am now
then daffy raised her face to his asking said the demean is the work of myrtles
put a terrible ordeal again awaits you
and i fool plan it also in mind could be vexed with you for it
bring this before your mind and everything elsie you must accept with it if you consent with a time arrives to become mine conceal in palio nothing
so our ki is intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day
he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
his heart contracted painfully it his solicitude about his uncle's fate increased when philippicus informed him that the conspirators had been wrested at the banquet and headed by ames the rodion chrysippus and brocas had perished by the executioner's sword at sunrise
besides he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one last word
on the way his heart throbbed almost to bursting
even ethne's image and what threatened her father and her with him was seated far into the background
he was appearing before his companions only to give truth it's just due
the egyptian obey and his master crossed the wide space strewed with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the festal performances even had his eyes retained the power of sight his blood was coursing so wildly through his veins that he might perhaps have been enabled to distinguish the statues around him and the thousands of spectators who crowded closely together richly garlanded their cheeks glowing with enthusiasm surrounded the arena hermon
shouted his friend solus and joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk harman
even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeanour he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithful to his art and his nature
honour to mirus and his art but he trusted the noble feast ile assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception and a his prayer for recovery
afterward it was supposed that he was satisfied with a blood of oxen lamps and doves and that in exchange for or an account of these sacrifices this god gave rain fan shine and harvest
whether he was the creator of yourself and myself
whether ane prayer was ever answered
why you de create the intellectually inferior
why they he create the deformed and hep why they he create the criminal the idiotic the insanely

is the got responsible for religious destitution for the inquisition for the tone screw and rack and for all the instruments of torture
dip this got alone the cruel and vile to destroy the brave and virtuous
did he load tyrants to shed a blood of patriots
can we conceive of a devil base enough to prefer his enemies to his friends
how can we account for the wild beasts that the war human beings for the fan serpents whose bind is death
how can the account for a world were live feats on life
did infinite with them intentionally produce the microscopic beasts that feed upon the optics think of blinding a man to satisfy the appetite of a microbe

can we say that he cared for the t doom of men
can we say that his mercy endured for ever
to reprove his goodness by showing that he has opened the earth and swallowed to thousand of his helpless children or that with the volcanoes he has overwhelmed them which rivers of fire
was their goodness was their wisdom in this
all the superior rays two than god that they erred the inferior
most people clink to the supernatural
if they give up one god they imagine another
what is this power
man advances and necessarily advances to experience
a man wishing to go to a certain place come toward the road divides
he has tried that road and knows that it is the wrong road
a child shunned by the beauty of the flame grasped it with his dimpled hand
the power were that works for righteousness had taught the child a listen
it is a reason
it is insisted by the theologians and by many of the sol called philosophers that this moral sense this sense of duty of obligation was imported and the conscience is an exotic
weave to getting families drives and nations
they out praised admired and respected
they are regarded as good that is to say as moral
the members who added to the misery of the family the tribe of the nation are considered bad meanders
the greatest of human beings had said conscience is born of love
as people advance you remote consequences are perceived
the imagination is cultivated
a man but seems se in the place of another
the sense of duty becomes stronger more imperative
man judges himself
in all this there is nothing supernatural
man hash deceived himself

dur leach of the puritan was an an adulterated curse
the puritan believed the bible to be the world of god and this belief has always made those who held it cruel and to wretched
let me refer to just one fact showing the influence of a belief in the bible on human beings
the queen received the bible kissed it and pledged herself to diligently wad therein
in other words it was just as fiendish just as in famous as the catholic spirit
has the d i will made the people of george or kind the merciful
religion has been pried and in all couples in all times that's fain
religion as always been the enemy of science of investigation enfold
religion has never made men free
it has never made man moral tempered industrious and honest
our christians more temperate nearer virtuous nearer honest than savages
conmee your disease by supplication
can we receive virtue or hunger as arms
religion rests on the idea that nature has a master and that this master re listened to prayer that his master punishes and rewards that he loves praise and flattery and hates the brave and free

we now knew that our first parents were not for us
we now know if we know anything that the universe is natural and that man and women have been naturally produced
we know the parts that life has travelled
we know the footsteps of advance they have been crazed
four thousands of years men and women have been trying to reform the world
why have reforms same
they depend on the law on luck a charity
they live by frau and vials and bequeath their vices to their chillen
failure seems to be the trade mark of nature why
nature produced without purpose the states without intention and destroys without fulsome
master world for ever remained the victim of ignorant passion
why should men and women have childrens that they cannot take care of children that are burden and curses why
passion is and always has been deaf

it is far bad to be free to leave the faults and barricades of fear to stand erect and faith the future with a smile
there done far said the schoolmaster in a loki to the sweat outward the of the trio and mind your eye
the two monsters took off their shoes and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses
by means of this stratagem they followed so closely that over within the few steps of sarah and tom they did not hear them
sarah and her brother having again passed by the cappy fag arrived close to the dilapidated house which was partly in blowings and its open cellars formed a kind of gulf along which the street ran in that direction
in an instant the schoolmaster with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized satan with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling you into his hole
no said the old boat grumblingly nell not one mame my as shame
tom seton did not lose his presence of mind during this scene rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred
oo ah to lay a trap to catch us replied the thief
then addressing thomas eaton you know the plain of saints dennis
did you see in the cavalry we have just left for i know you again the man whom the charcoal man came to seek
cried the schoolmaster a thousand francs and i'll kill him
fet i do not seek his life replaited sarah to the schoolmaster
let's go and meet him
old boy it would pay for looking after her
well my wife shall be there said the schoolmaster you will tell her what you want and i shall see

france who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert's request but at once accompanied him to the desired spots and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon
my very good friend and excellent neighbour replied the count with a smile you really exeter my trifling exertions
my father the comte de morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i am hesitatingly placed the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal
i can scarcely credit it
then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity at the present to realise plans that i have long meditated
show me the positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour for hours said albert that will suit me to adopt
so be it then replied the count's and extending his hand tow the calendar suspended near the chimneypiece he said to day is the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o'clock now promise me to remember this and expect me the twenty first of me at the same hour in the forenoon
i residing my father's house but occupy you pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard and tiles separated from the main building
now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket may yourself perfectly easy the hand of your timepiece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself
that depends when do you leave
for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two
then we shall not meet in paris
i fear i shall now have her honour
well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young man allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey
what is the matter asked albert of france when they had returned to their own apartments you see more than commonly thoughtful
i will confess to you all that replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
did you ever meet him previously to coming hither
upon my honour than listen toy
he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one night he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof our trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant arising driving under full sale toward port or
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the countess vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the banded peppino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled
but said france the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel
why really the thing seems to meet simple enough
talking of countries replied france of what countries the counts what is his native thong whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life a life as marvellous as alone that hath tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy and misanthropy
certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered
my dear france replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert the morcerfs in danger helped me to deliver him
what are his means of existence what is his both place of what country's a native
i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from hands of senor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and concern i did not very particularly care to remain
and this time it must be confessed to that contra of the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's side
well said france with a sigh do as you please my dear vis count for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation
and now my dear franz let us talk of someday else
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination i bet the morcerfs would follow up whose researches by means of a small gait similar to that close to the concierge's store and which merits a particular description
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate
at a quarter to ten a valid entered he composed with a little room named john and who only spoke english all albert's establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count's chasseurs also
wait then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wished
very well at half us ten
is the countess hope yet
the valet left the room
good morning is young good morning said albert your punctuality really alarmed me
you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past
no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans
yes he has not much to complain of boches the capital of charles the seven
it is for that reason you seem you so early
i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i gossip to have a ride for an hour
pests i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them acceptable
besides that does not concern the harm but the financial department
about what about the papers
in the entire political wold of which you are one of the leaders
they say that it is quite fair and that swinging so much red you ought to reap a little blue
come come that is not by said lucia
with the old talents he would make your fortune in three or four years
the gentleman had not needed to sit down to become interested apparently he had taken up the volume from a table as soon as he came in and standing there after a single glance round the apartment had lost himself in it pages
that has an unflattering sound for me said the young man
she is winning to is that
just as i am the visitor inquired presenting himself with brother a way day aspect
him was tall well lean and dressed throughout in black his shirt collar was low and wide and a triangle of linen a little trampled exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat was adorned by your pin containing a small red stone
in spite of this decoration the young man licked poor as fore as a young man could look who had such a fine hed and such magnificent eyes
those of basal ransom were dark deep and glowing his hand had a character of innovation which fairly added to his pio it was ahead to this scene above the level with the crowd and some judicial bench or political platform or even on a bronze medal
these things the eyes especially with their smouldering fire might have indicated that he was to be a great american statesmen or on the other hand that i simply have proved that he came from carolina or alabama
and yet the reader who lets a complete image who desires to read with the senses as well as with the reason is entreated not to forget that he prolonged his consonance and swallowed his vowels that he was gil to the legiance and interpolations which were equally unexpected and that his discourse was pervaded by something sultry and vast something always that wien in its rich basking tone something that suggested the tuning expounds o the cotton field
and he took up his hat vaguely a soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim
well so it is they are all witches and wizards mediums and spirit rappers and row in radicals
if you were know to dine with her you had better know it oh murder
elped missus luna with intelligent incredulity
she was attractive and impertinent especially the latter
have you been in e
no i haven't been anywhere
she hates it she would like to abolish it
this last remark he made that a venture for he had naturally not devoted any supposition whatever to missus lena
are you very ambitious you look as if you were
and missus nana added that now she was back she didn't know which i should do
one did have given her would one have come back for
besides olive didn't want her im buston and didn't gaze through the form of sailing so
that was one comfort with emly she never went from any forms
she stood there looking consciously and whether seriously and mister ransom a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lips it was just b symptom enough to light up the native gravity of her face
her voice was no and agreeable a cultivated voice and she extended a slender white hand to her visitor who remarked with some solemnity he felt a certain guilt of participation in missus luna's indiscretion that he was intensely happy to make her acquaintance
heired that miss chancellor's hand was at once called and limp she nearly placed it in hiss without exerting the smallest pressure
i shall be back very late we're then a few of party that's one we die so early
missus lean's familiarity extended even to her sister she remarked to miss chancellor that she looked as if she were got her for a sea voyage
poor ransom announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery but in reality he had never been so boot as at that moment
the women he had hitherto known had been mainly his own soft climb and it was not often exhibited the tendency he detected and curs deplored in missus louis's sister
ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very provincial
he was sorry for her but his sorr in a flash that no one could help her that was what made her tragic
she could not defend herself against a rich admiration a kind of tenderness of envy of anyone who had been so happy as to have that opportunity
his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations the home had tasted of all the cruel two deputes
the state of mississippi seemed to him the state of despair so he sur vented the remnants of his passy to his mother and sisters and at nearly thirty years of age delighted for the first time in new york in the costume of his province with fifty dollars in his pocket and now in hunger in his heart
it was in the female line as b of manson had written in answering her letter with a good dell form and flourish he spike as if they had been royal houses
if it had been possible to send missus ransom money or even clothes she would have liked that but she had moms of ascertaining her such a luff ring would be taken
on it had a fear of everything but had grown to spear was of being afraid
she had erected it into a sort of role of conduct that whenever she saw risk she was to take it and she had frequent humiliations at finding herself saved under
she was perfectly safe after writing to bas olsen and indeed it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except than her he was only exceptionally superior for her letter and assure her that he would come and see her the first time his business he was beginning to get a little should take him to boston
he was too simple to mississippian for that she was almost disappointed
of all things in the world contention was most sweet to her though why it is hard to imagine who had always cost her tears headaches a deal too em bad acuter and it was th impossible baser ransom would not care to compend
miss chancellor herself a folk so much of the vital subject would not she make a few remarks and give them some of her experiences
how did the late is un beacon street feel about the ballot
there she could speak for them move their fools and others
with immense sympathy for reform she found herself so often wishing that reformers wherein it all different
i have hated dar that finer than you talked aloud as if it was such a remarkable place and live there won't proof of lovely glory
allow sort of been fear you keep all if there and so brilliant a woman is missus tinder g lift a blackberry o not to mixed up
she knew the place in the boston highway key and it was not what missus falander supposed so that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been over represented to for the aristocracy
soon wished to act in another field she had now been preoccupied with the romance of the people
this might sing her the most accessible of pleasures but infraction have not founded so
charley was a alan man in a wide over coat and a paper collar it was norham in the latter nis that the cared much the most
on chancellor wondered how missus dander would treat their brown to the question
it wouldn't be necessary well repent to take seven steps to conciliate the shrinking
our movement is more it would be also the most stoic ladies
there's this standard am then and bringing your thousand veins
and look after the details as well as the big currents missus falander added in a turn as explanatory as could be expected of such a women and with a smile of which the sweetness was filling to her listener
so olive chancellor with a vase which seemed to plead for a remissions responsibility
have want to be mean to them to hope them
it was nothing to choose for herself but now the wake representative of the enchantment of the sex from every firm of bandage her chosen for her
the unhappiness of women
they were his sisters they were her own and the dier diary had dawned
this was the only sacred cause this was the great the dust re volition it was giant it was sweer within before it it must exact from the honour the bub lust e rather race the lost party grew expiation
there would be names of willing weet insulted to persecuted but devoted in e impulse of their being to the cause and asking no better faith than to die for it
it were not clear to this interesting girl in what manners such a sacrifice at this last would be acquired of her th she saw the matter through a kind of sur wise miser the nation which late danger as rosie is success
when this bows i approached it transfigured her familiar h conical sheep and made the poor little humanity hack sing go ready a martyr
o if chancellor looked at her with love remanded that she had never in her long in the world and weary life had a thouth
she had been consumed by the passion of sympathy it had crumpled her into as many creases and all glazed distended glove
but scuse me d you forgot during some detecting and gi an up fishing
and shag with the freedom of an old servant stood looking at his mastery as if not great understanding the new twist the affairs had taken
i'm gin all fishin i may not catch anything and mean i want to after i get there
gid ready shag yes a cun
and having put himself in a fair way as he hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darcy case colonel ashley went down to police headquarters to learn more facts in the connection with the murder of the east indian
pick us and dona haven't they carol yee up
carl was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke girl lazily upwards from his cigar just then to say mores
are you going to work on that case colonel
but he hadn't any more to do with it colonel the that cat
perhaps not admitted colonel ashley
we've got our man and that's all we want
you are on the darcy case they tell me in a way yes
i marking in the interest of the young man
it's just one of them coined like
lusted his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair
gad explained the colonel
the very pair i was going to buy
look here colonel do you know anything about this
and the detective's professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
i happened to see those candlesticks in the window of single pont's shop the other day and i made up my mind to buy them when i had a chance
now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen
thought i don't know whether that's his first or his last name anyhow he had a partner named sheerly
anyhow he infected get a long burry while it seems
neighbors often heard him scraping lot and this afternoon they went at it again to hawking heavy
toward dark a man went into by a lamp
he found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was all e's body with the head busted in in this heavy candlestick near it
sure held so tight we could hard to get it out
maybe the fight was about who owned the watch for the dagoes talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were saying i see
and the watch have you it y asks tear
that's the watch announced the headquarters detective reaching in for it going at see
you're not a squeamish as all that are you just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's
and donovan voice was plainly sceptical
yes it be have some rough edges on it
and i've rad enough about germs to know the danger i'd advise you to be careful
if you don't mind i should like to examine this a bit
before the big wind and ireland suggested thong with the nod of desirous compatriot slightly you'll have the colonel
that's rout agreed the colonel as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
in a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a lead pencil
and donovan take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it
has the surprised detective yes
don't scratch yourself on it whatever you do why not
simply because this watch
someone out her to see you
all i meet here in a second
singa phut was the panting answer
i want to talk over darcy's case with you the colonel had said and the two had talked had thought had talked again and now were silent for a time
what are the church of getting him off legally if we go alighted from a negative standpoint asked the colonel
rather a hypothetical question colonel but i should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition
at best he would get off with the scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn't want that nor do i
and you hid to wanted either
but i want to know just where we stand now i know
but i need to do a little more smoking out first now i want to think
if you'll excuse me i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may cat something
in fact i have a feeling dial my fish
i'd recommend him to you instead of blackstone thanks lapped kenneth
what is it perhaps i can help you
the old adage of two head yen
yes it still holes good
no alimony replied the colonel puzzled yes just that
and there's no reason you shouldn't know
chuckled the colonel as he skilfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook
and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip a now limp fish into the creole colonel last it gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
the reason she asked no alimony inquired kenneth
no i wasn't thinking of that
however don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough for to day
well i don't know that you can
it isn't generall i know went on the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him
it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of a baser sort
you don't mean that larch struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did
the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him
aaron grafton statement was being unexpected great confirmed
he remembered that cynthia and grafton had once been in love with each other
she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer
because larch made no defence
larch by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
so i had to let her have her way and meed i asked the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel fee
no but he will or i'll sue him and get judgment oh he'll pay all right
and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up
still i would like to know
the murder of missus darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweler was tried
it had a double reputation so to speak
grave and even reverent the conventions assembled in its ball room and politicians of the upper if not better class were frequently seen in its dining room or cafe
larch himself was a peculiar character
in a smaller place he would have been called a saloon keeper
and it was this man rich overs said handsom certainly that cynthia retford had married
to this was the answer whispered money
and in a way was true
she also saw it opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges
after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the large hotel it could hardly be called a home became the scene of many festive occasions
then it was said of large that soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat his wife for the refined cruelty that hidden away from the public underneath his habitual matter there was the wrongness of the brute
but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less offen represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already s marched are who had not yet acquired any and were rolling to take a chance
it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me in the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be see there kenneth explained to the colonel
meanwhile colonel ashley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he sawed darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something be done always returned the answer
don't worry it will come out all right
i'm going to rectify them but it will take time
it's hard for missus mason too although she's bearing up like a major
so king goot bail who put it up
it was time larch
they took harry away while ago
but he is a pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same
only that i darcy hesitated and grew red
good evening colonel he called genially will you draw me in a welsh rabbit
thank you no
i'm afraid my dad jest and isn't quite up to that as i've had to cut out my fishing of late
now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder
the stopped clocks for instance have you any theory
there were three of them the center figure being gone of harry king and he was very much intoxicated
that is not always but sometimes it happen to be so now
i beg your pardon he said in the conjured tones he knew so well how to use yet of which he made so little use of late
i said where have you been remarked the other we've missed you
i said i was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort
by polonius someone ask
because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks to much but who is not so wise as he thinks
there was a rattle of coin on the mahogany bar as king sought to disentangle a single bill from the wadded up currency in his pocket
it's it's an odd coin an old roman one that missus darcy had in her private collection kept in the jewel door safe was the whispered answer
i went over then near the day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed
that was hers w on the door
now harry king has it exclaimed colonel sly
even the sun came out pale and watery at noon
the coals and rheumatism of the rain mons vanished
as to worker last sunday you did it when the yunkers
while didn't they shoot us one man exhibited his arms ling

this man especially welcomed the call to congress of peasants
this laughed wheat the young generation who had been serving in the army
whereupon the old axe cory committee left the hall
down with him they streaked
fearful tumult christ down with the bolsheviki
upon my return i've visited morny no such accusation was made against me there after a brief conversation i left and that saul let any in present make such an accusation
meanwhile the question of the straits of the excuse committee was agitating all minds
by declining their assembly extraordinary conference it had been planned to pluck the reelection of tex cure committee
but this word both ways the last socialist revolutionist decided that if the congress had no power over the exit committee then tax guy committee had no power over the congress
on the twenty seventh occurred the debate on the land question we should rebuild the differences between the agent programme of the bolsheviki and the lef socialist revolutionaries
the confident assembly will not dare to break with the wheel of the people
followed him lenin listened to now with absorbing intensity
the first date was the crushing of auto crazy and the crushing of the power of the industrial capitalist and the landowners who interested are glues related
the dumas and sem stiles were dropped
he knew that an agreement with the bolsheviki was being discoursed but he did not know that it to had been concluded
he spoke to the wrong convention
the villages will see worse in the

the ween of millions of workers is sound concentrated in the hall
a new humanity will be born of this war
i greet you with the christiana of an eurus in life and freedom
then i took up a great stone from among the trees and coming up to him smote him therewith on the head with all my might and crushed in his skull as he lay dead drunk
behold a ship was making for the island through the dashing sea and flashing waves
hearing this i was sore troubled remembering what i had before suffered from the ape kind
upon this he brought me a cotton bag and given it to me said take this bag and fill it with pebbles from the beach and gave forth with the company of the townsfolk to whom i will give a charge respecting thee
do as they do and belike thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land
then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pebbles
to these he committed me commending me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how to gather that he may get his daily bread and you will earn your reward and recompense in heaven
now sleeping under these trees were many apes which when they saw us rows and fled from us and swarmed up among the branches whereupon my companions began to pelt them with what they had in their bags and the apes fell to plucking of the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk
we weighed anchor and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying o permitted say
when it was the five hundred and fifty ninths night
and ceased not sailing till we arrived safely at bassorah
there i abode a little and then went on to bagdad where i entered my quarter and found my house and were gathered with my family and saluted my friends it gave me joy of my safe return and i laid up all my goods and valuables in my storehouses
after which i returned to my old merry way of life and forgot all i had suffered in the great prophet and gain i had made
next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawned prayer and after blessing mohammed the cream of all creatures betook himself to the house of sinbad the seaman and wished him a good day
here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales therein
happily mongst you is one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up and all and everything on board of her were plunged into the sea
but it burneth in their bellies so they cast it up again and it concealeth on the surface of the water whereby its color and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it ashore and the travellers and merchants who know it collected and sell it
each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides and after little the rest of my fellows perished one by one till i had buried the last of the party and a bode alone on the island with but a little provision left i who was wont to have so much
but there is majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great
when it was the five hundred and sixty first not
then signed for myself i set to work collecting a number of pieces of chinese and corner and aloes wood and i bound them together with robes from the wreckage then i chose out from the broken up ships straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the yellows wood making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel of the stream and i tied it tightly and firmly as though it were nailed
land after land shalt thou see can find but no other life on thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul and thy thoughts a night all woes shall lend or sooner or late
i rode my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried with a raft with it down the underground channel
and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft by reasons of the narrowness of the channel whilst the stream ceased not to carry me along knowing not night from day for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me about in my terror and concern for myself lest i should perish
when i awoke at last i found myself in the light of heaven and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft moored to an island in the midst of a number of indians and abyssinian
but i was delighted at my escape from the river
when they saw i understood the knight and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace be with thee o my brother
o my brother answered he we a husbandman u tillers of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding thee asleep on this raft laid hold of it and made it fast by us against thou shouldest awake at thy leisure
i answered for o lad's sake and my lord ere i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after ask me what thou wilt
when it was the five hundred and sixty second night
she said it hath reached me our auspicious king that sinbad the seamen continued when our landed and found myself amongst the indians and abyssinian and had taken some rest they consulted among themselves and said to one another there is no help for it but we carry him with us and present him to our king that he may acquaint him with his adventures
so i consorted with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respect
so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing to set out with the merchants for that i pined after my people and mine own land
quoth he thou art thine own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us hor head nye be it for thou gladdest us with thy company
by allah are my lord answered i thou hast indeed i be whelmed me with thy favours and well doings but i weary for a sight of my friends and family and native country
then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchant safer said
he asked me whence they came and i said to him by allah a commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way thither
for state processions a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant eleven cubits high and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks on his right hand and on his left
his letter hath shown me this and as for the mightiness of his dominion thou hast told us what thou hast thy witnessed
presently my friends came to me in a distributed presents among my family and gave arms and largesse after which i yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment mirth and merrymaking and forgot all that i had suffered
such then are my brothers is the history of what befell me in my sixth voyage and to morrow in shall
i will tell you the story of my seventh in last voyage which is still more wondrous and marvellous than that of the first six
when it was the five hundred and sixty third night
she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sinbad the seaman had related the history of what befell him in his sixth voyage and all the company had dispersed sinbad the landsman went home and slept as of want
the seventh voyage of sinbad the satan
no o company that after my return from my sixth voyage which brought me abundant profit i resumed my former life and all possible joyance and enjoyment and mirth and making merry day and night and i tarried some time in this solace and satisfaction till my soul began once more to long to sail the seas and see foreign countries and company with merchants and hear new things
so having made up my mind are packed up in bales quantity of precious stuffs suited for sea trade and repaired with them from bagdad city t bassorah town where i found a ship ready for sea and in her a company of considerable merchants
but the captain arose and tighten in his girdle tucked up his skirts and after taking refuge with oar from sat and the stoned climbed to the masthead whence he looked out right and left and gazing at the passengers and crew foul to buffet in his face and plucking out his beard
this he set in a saucer wetted with a little water and after waiting a short time smelt and tasted it and then he took out of the chest a booklet wherein he read a while and said weeping no are yee passengers but in this book is a marvellous matter denoting that whoso come tit that shall surely die without hope of escape for that this ocean is called the sea of the climb of the king wherein is a sepulchre of our lords solomon son of david on both be peace
a second fish wad its appearance and which we had seen naught more monstrous
when suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship which rose out of the water and settled upon the great reef the haunt of sea monsters where it broke up and fell asunder into planks and all and everything on board were plunged into the sea
unfortunately there could be no doubt our misconception as the platter baths gilt
he had not only pleaded guilty but had expressed his intention of repeating his escapade in other directions as soon as circumstances permitted throughout the trial he was visit sum many a small model of the free trade hall in manchester
vary could not possibly find that the prisoner had not deliberately an intention a blown up the albert hall the question was could they find any extenuating circumstances which would permit of an acquittal
of course any sentence which the law might feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an image a pardon but it was highly desirable from the governments pint of view that the necessity for such an exercise of clemency should not arise
a headlong pardon and the eve of a bi election with threats of a heavy voting defection if it were withheld or even the lid would not necessarily be a surrender but it would look like one
hence the anxiety in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in whitehall and dawning street and other affected centres

the word of the sound had reference it was understood the incarcerating government and not to the destroyer of the albert hall
the seat was lost after all by a narrow maturity

it was a little present for my mother and myself for your silver wedding
i should have given to you last night after dinner only it happened to be a cream jog and you seemed annoyed at having so many pickets so i felt ratler awkward about giving another
thus nature had been an orphan this many years
lady ernestine pigeon court his mother moved in circles which were entirely beyond their compass or ambitions and the sun would probably one day be an ambassador
husband and wife looked blandly and desperately at one another
it was missus peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there are thieves in the house we keep the drawing room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while we are at breakfast
she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not being stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later bearing a cream jug in her hands
the pigeon coats had turned paler than ever missus peter had a final inspiration
peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lived so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed within measurable disan
missus peter turned to her guest with confidential kindness
petre is little weakness a turn seemed the family good lord
do you mean the ses a clapt amene like cousin's natur
very little woman said bitter with a gasps of relief i could never have done it
and from the car lying off the coast
don't cry he said i was obliged to come
and and you have not found out anything came in quick frightened tones
i wish you would believe me that i am in as great trouble about as you are
that my father is sir risdon graham smuggled goods here
he could not help it he hated the smugglers you shall not tell
pray pray say you will not archie his son
then as archie stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he head the faint rustling once more and again all was simon
he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full of vexation engine ema proper as the prince caller a love of our own dignity of which archibald grey stroke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british officer had a pretty good stock
and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
cold wooer came on this idea directly as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
i'll soon show them that i am not going to be play with
for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless sit of people who would stop at nothing
no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would knock me about
the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could
to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest pointed signal for help whilst a boat's crew roy surging for him how to escape
the window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone sill
next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old fashioned marble mantelpiece fireplace chimney
yes if otherways failed he could escape up the chimney
no that was too bad he cannot do that
sympathy and pity for the dwellers and the hose were completely gone now and he said his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people
a narrow table against the wall in two places
he went and tried to force his head through recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the bother would pass
but there was no chance for his body there that had would not go first
a fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
sure you look ground everywhere boy yes father quite
i'm going on the breakfast
shall i come t feather no
stop here till sir risdon tum down until him i'm very sorry that we should have cleared out last night only a born fool saw jerry andy's lobster boat coming into the cove and came running to say it was a party from the cutter yes father
tell him not to be uneasy tis all right and i'll have everything clear away tonight
the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin or archy ray stroke lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down my sleep
would a queer dream be felt to himself
and how queer for mister gurr to be talking like that to andrew teal the boy who helps the cook
and why did andy call mister gurr father
there was an interval of thinking over this knotty question during which the low whistling went on
and i'm hungry too till i was up i suppose
no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint mist hung like wreaths of smoke
what did they say false alarm tell servants then they would clear all away to night see if anything had been left about lobster wrote
once of that room he could ran and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunt him down
oh those bowers he ment they exclaimed and he was advancing towards them just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of bootes against stone work and ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young m chien instead
r was the first to recover from his surprise
blow he said hurl
go round and opened the door i was shut him last night by mistake
i saw you last night and wondered was boy he was
it was you father kick for shirking and my well i hardly knowed you
nonsense
won't do said remembering
think i don't know you mister orficer
won't do said rod quickly i know you
complying the spire to a you beano af you in
archie stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
he has gone to give the alarm about the prisoner and he looked excitedly round for away of escape
nothing but the chimney presented itself
a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curved dirk glanced at the edge ran to the window and began to cut at one of the bars labor in vain
he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks in grating sounds as he realized that the attempt was madness
the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear a selling sound as he found that now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thus back the darken to a sheath
no we can't part with that ha ha ha laughed the boy jeeringly
fellow yes i'll give you a guinea if he will let me out
guinea said the boy think i'll do it for a guinea we too
be quick theres a good fellow i want to get away at once
not you only you sham
why your clothes don't fit you when your caps put on all secure
never mind about that let me out of this place
i told you a fisher boy cried arch impatiently but trying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
not you look like a wild beast in a cage like a monkey you insolent
archie checked himself and the boy laughed
it was your turn yesterday it's mine to day what a game
you laughed and cleared at me when i was on the cutter's deck
i say you do with lea to lemon just like a big moan show
ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long low fit of laughter
you rope send me he said
why i could tie you up in a knot and heave you off the cliff any day what a game
bit of a minty fed on a salt tack and mutely biscuit talk of giving me ropes and
once more will you come and let me out no
too his astonishment the boy did not flinch but thrust his own arms ther replacing him about the middy's waist clenching his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle

to return away impatiently again and signing to his men to follow they all began to tramp up a steep check leading toward the hose that the rabbits settling away among the firs and showing their white conny tails for a moment as they darted down into their holes

about the last of december eighteen seventy three i arrived in carol parish louisiana
i stayed there until the eighth of february eighteen seventy four
i had not heard of that when i wrote the letter of eighteen seventy four and to correct any misapprehension that might be created by omitting it i will say that at the time i was at neo kansas with a drove of cattle which i sold to major ray
it was immediately following the rock alan robbery at eight air iowa that there first appeared a delivered and listen of some local papers in missouri to connect us with this robbery
i urged on the boys that whatever happened we should not shear anyone
the mill and i crossed the bridge the three were on some dry good boxes at the corner near the bank and as soon as they saw us went right into the bank instead of waiting for us to get there
when we came up i told me if he shut the bank door which they had left open in their hurry
je yes allen whose hardware store was near try to go into the bank but miller ordered him away and you ran around the corner shouting
get your guns boys they're robbing the bank
and i called to him to get inside at the same time firing a pistol shout in the air as the signals of the three boys at the bridge that we had been discovered
almost at this instant i heard a pistol shot in the bank
shadwell woods and jim wode up in joiners shouting to the people in the street to get inside and firing their pistols to emphasize their commands
if any of our party shot him it must have been woods
meantime the street was getting uncomfortably hot
every time i saw anyone with a beat on me i would drop off my horse and trot to drive the sheet inside but i could not see in every direction
doctor wheeler who had gone upstairs in the hotel shot miller and he lay dying in the street
changing his pistol to his left hand bob ran out and mounted millard's mayor
what kipt you so long ice pits
as to the rest of the affair inside of the bank i take the account of a north field narrator
where the money outside the safe bob that
the shutters were closed and this cause bunker an instant's delay that was almost fatal pit chased him with a boat
the first one missing but the second went through his right shoulder
that night it started to rin and we wore out our horses

finally we administered to him an oath not to betray our whereabouts until we had time to make our escape and he agreed not to
no sooner however was he released than he made post taste into manco to announce our presence and in a few minutes another posse was looking force
the whistle on the old meal blue when we feared that it was a signal that had been agreed upon to alarm the town in case we were observed but we were not molested
he had to sleep with it pillow on my breast jim being also cripple with a wound in his shoulder and we could not get much sleep

six steps to the front sheriff clisson colonel t oval v m rice g bard c e pomeroy and s j severs

i got up as the signal for the charge and we fired one bally
one of the fellows in the outer line not brave enough himself to join the volunteers who had come in to be discounted was not disposed to believe in the surrender and had his gun levelled on bob in spite of the handkerchief which was waving as a flag of truce
sheriff clisson of water one county who was taking bob's pistol from him was also shouting to the fellow
including those received in and on the way from north field i have eleven wounds
and chair glen's order not to shoot was the beginning of the protector that minnesota people established over us
captain murdock
but mars port had flourished enough to kill it off
some of mar's laws dated from the time when lawn force ment had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
the stone wall gang numbered perhaps five hundred
even dar lex and failures had to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which eked out some kind of i marginal living
they were safe from protection rackets there none bothered to come so far out
the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
captain murdock was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
the pressure was enough to get them for him
gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
i've got a free hand and we're going to run this the way we would on earth
your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
the first man making a shake down we'll get the same treatment we're going to use on the stonewall boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
he picked out five of the men included gordon you five will come with me
the rest of you can team up anyway you want to night pick any rout the open though came m lets go
bruce gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick and murdock's eyes fell on him earth cop
two years gordon admitted
for a second gordon cursed himself
he began wondering about security then
nobody had tried to get in touch with him
there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim poser ball glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
moving in two groups of threes at opposite sides of the street they began their beat
there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lack of air
gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands
corn's eyes popped at that
he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
the other four copse had come in reluctantly
he brought him to the ground with a single blow crossed the kidneys
they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cups started off
to find a fern and call the wagon
we're not using wagons murdock told him lye them up
if they tried to run they were hit from behind yet they stood still they were clubbed carefully
murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulder shaking in tears running down his cheeks
the captain's face was as sick as gordons felt
i want the name of every man and the gang you can remember he told the man
colonel they kill me i don't know
murdock took his nod as evident enough and turned to the wretched tufts
if he sh turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
trouble began brewing shortly after though
murdock sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of sixth and then a third
and the third one bruce corn spotted one of the men had been beaten before
get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he wor
but the captain stirred finally sighing
now the cost are giving me were covered gordon
but the stonewall gangs backing wane
but it's goin to be tough on them
bruce gordon grimace i've got a yellow ticket from security
murdock blinked he dropped his eyes slowly
what makes you think wain will be reelected
nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
never see a martian election
no your first trew he can't lose
and then how is going to pop and this whole plant may be blown wide open
it fitted with the diet predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner
cost a more but they be respectable
because is he is always honest according to have he sees it
but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
the groups grew more experienced and murdock was trying a new squad every night
it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
this could lead to abuses as he'd seen on earth
but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor wain was re elected
it was night outside and the phosphoric bulbs at the corners glowed dim lan giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporised precinct house
it had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down
and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that hayley's system was working
gordon hit the signal switch and the mars speaker let out a shrill whistle
gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
you can't do it to me
i'm reformed i'm going straight
you damned cops kant omnia was blubbering
one look was enough the work papers had the tell tale over thickening of the signature they had showed up on other papers obviously forgeries
some turned away as gordon and the other cop went to work but most of them weren't squeamish
when it was over the two picked up their whimpering captive
chickens the other cup had been holding the wallet
must have been making a big contact and something fifty fifty
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
when gordon and jenkins came back murdock tossed the money to them split it
whatever comes to han gov'nor
like this social call a gordon asked him
the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober no
you o me some bells governor
eleven hundred fifty credits
you didn't pay up your pledge to the captain fund so i had a fill in
a thousand interest at ten percent a week standard right
gordon had heard of the friendly interest charge on the side here but he shook his head wrong is he
ha is he turned it over and shook his head
now show me where i signed any agreement saying i'd pay you back
first second izzie's face went blank then he chuckled
he poured out the bills and handed them over
thanks his he thanks yourself
the kid pocketed the money cheerfully nodding
the little guy knew mars as few others did apparently from all sides
and if any of the other cops had private rackets of their own is he was undoubtedly the man to find it out and used the information with a beat such as that even going halves and with all the graft to the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped into the bench
go on except dam it
there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
the little publisher was back at the crusader again
only gordon and sheila were left
credit had been established again and the businesses were opened
gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwellings built like the dome but opaque for privacy
they have been lucky
shoolbred's volunteers were official now
bat's place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
he reached automatically for the class of ether needle beer
thought ye'd be in the chips
that's mars gord knacker brothers comment why don't you pull off the planet fats you could go back to earth i'd guess the other nodded
guess a man gets used to anything hell maybee i can hire some bumps to sit around and mop it up when the ships come in and bill this is a real old martian den of sin
there was a grin on the other's face
finally got o our orders for you it's mercury
we sent to ty others the same way and they failed
let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
you can't stay here
there's a rocket waiting to tranship you to the man on the way to mercury right now gordon sighed
and i paid her the pay we owe you from the time you began using your beds she's up shopping
but his old eyes were glinting
did you think we'd let you go without seeing you off cobb he asked
i i oh dread it i'm getting old izzie you tell him
he grabbed gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank izzie shook his head
any colchester had begun to make prince with leslie
leslie determined to tripe upon us an english language and literature
their tastes all lay induration her idea being by and by to follow her mother's proficient of jermyn already showed considerable aptitude

lesley opened the door
jane harriot stood without

leslie seated herself with her back to her companion and opened her o letters

just after midnight she rose with a sigh to prepare for beard
she looked round the room
now i remember she got a letter which upset her very much and went out
leslie vent to the window and flung it open she put her head out and tried to peer into the darkness but the moon had already said as she could not see more than a cup of yards in front of her
she is a fery queer the rated creature and that litter there was bad news in their litter
what can't you doing out by herself
nly lit the room but she had scarcely gone a dozen places down the corridor before she met any returning
andy eyes were very bright her cheeks were no longer pale and there was a brilliant color on them
she did not take the least notice of listing but going into the room shut the door
don't begin said anny

i walked up and down as fast as ever i could outside in order to make myself sleepy
they talked to me lissy don't see a single word

now princess at once she said in a voice of authority if you really wish to sleep
enny steered vacantly and the cocoa din she uttered a laugh
drink bad she said

she got into bit as she spoke and wrapped the cloaks cutty round her
cut you manage with a candle just for once

she turned off the light and let her candle which she put behind her screen then prepared to get into beard
emmy's manner was very mysterious
annie did not mean to confine that anyone that night and the kindest thing was to leap her alone
tie it out ly yourself propped asleep
annie is that you she called out
there was no reply but the sound of prying steps came quicker and quicker now and then th interrupted by a groan
o this will kill me my heartful break this will kill me
the gold of saint elizabeth
immediately after to lay that evening leslie ran up to her room to make preparations for her visit to east hall
i'm not coming said e
