there's iron they say in all our bloods and a gran or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
margaret said mister hale as he returned from showing his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thornton made his confession of having been a shopboy
you don't mean that you thought me so silly
i really like that account of himself better than anything else he said
his statement of having been a shopboy was the thing are like best of w
you who were always accusing people of being shop he at helstone
i don't think mister hale you have done quite right int introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some part of what he said
his father dying in miserable circumstances
why it might have been in the workhouse
his fathers speculated wildly failed and then kill himself because he could not better disgrace
all his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
no one came forwards to help the mother and this boy
at least no friend came forwards immediately and mis thornton is not w i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to de find her out
so they lift milton
how tainted asked her father
or per paa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked up on them only as new ways of extending trade in making money
and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his ion nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
not vicious he never said that
improvident and self indulgent were his words
margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
however out it came
paa i do think mister thornton a very remarkable man but purse me i don't like him at all
c i do said her father laughing
first me as y call it and all
i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
but good night child
there was several other science of something wrong about missus hale
she and dixon held mysterious consultations in a bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was a custom when any distress of her mistress called up on her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chambers soon after dixon lifted and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
but though she received presses and f words back again in touch profusion as would have gladden her formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health'
she lay wet very long this night planning how to listen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
a servant give dixon permanent assistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attentions she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
visiting register officers seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she met bessy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
well busy how are you
bitter and not better if you knowed that means
not exactly replied margaret smiling
i better in not being torn to pieces by coughing or nights but i'm weary and tide o milton and longing to get away to the lo boola and when i think i'm father and farther off my heart sinks none no better i'm worse
margaret turned round to walk gong side of the girl in her feeble progress homewards
but for a minute or two she did not speak
at last she said in a low voice
busy jewish to die
bessy was silent in her turn for a mine or or two then she replied
not worse than many others are reckon
but what was it
you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton
i had forgotten when i said for the time continued margaret quietly
i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
the sharp us in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
as they turned up into a small court opening out into a scolded street bessy said
you will not be daunted de fathers at home and speaks a bit graf fish at first
but nicholas was not at home when they entered
cast bessie at last
busy took a long and feverish draught and then fell back and shut her eyes
margaret bent ogre and said bessy don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or they have been
remember who gave it to you and made it what it is
now i'll not have my wench preached to
but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of laugh it was to be
i believe where see and no mo
that's what i believe young woman
i don't believe all i hear no not by big deal
but whose come at last and whose welcome as long as who will keep from preaching on what who knows not about
its simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work
but the go and you pleaded the mo was margaret
turpin hardly on him is a good man heee
i sometimes think i shall be merk with sorrow evening the city of god if other is not there
the feverish collar came into a cheeks and the feverish flame into her eye
but you'll be there father ye shall oh my heart
she put her hand to it and became ghastly pale
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
presently the spasm that foreshadowed death had passed away and bie roused the soft and said
i'll go to bed it's best place but catching that margaret's gan y're come agen i know you will but just say it
oh come to morrow said margaret
margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
she was late for tea at home

i shall like to see her she must be an uncommon person her mother added
perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
she sounded to be such careful economical person that i should like any one out of the same family
my dear said mister hale will al armed pray don't go of on that idea
i am sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
take notice that this is not my kind of fortunes papa if i have any at all which are o' agree to or you always a choosing me of it

they did not stay there but walked out across the dance with the sky lacs were singing and on a dip of the dance came upon great stone wards and towers for strong and grey
what's that there said dy
replied he of a truth i heard him not and i wot him not and folks are all sleeping
but she said whomsoever thou seest awake hes the reciter
then said the yu art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him
rejoined the eunuch who then was the reciter point him out to me
by allah replied the fireman i tell thee the truth
tell me what happened whats ah m kan
what ails thee then that thou must needs reside verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are as lee for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
and he os improvised the two following this stitch
when n sat al zaman heard the first improvisation she called to wind her father and her mother and her brother and their will o home then she wept and cried to the eunuch and said to him wo to thee
he who recited the first time hath re society the second time and heard him hard by
by allah and thou fatch him not to me i will assuredly roused the chamberlain on thee and yee shall beat thee and cast the yee out
but take the hundred diners and give them to the singer and bringing him to me gently and do him no hurt
returned quietly and linger not
when it was the seventy third nine
but the yok said i will not leave thee till thou show me it was that society the verses for i dread returning into my lady without him
now when the fireman heard these words he feared for zau makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch by allah it was not i and they know him not
so go thou do thy station and if thou a gave meet anyone afterpart in aught of p trey whether he be near or far it will be i or someone i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me
then he kissed the oo's head and spake him fair till he went away but a castrato fetched around and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
i say what made my ignoring what have the beater cop i drain far be from me thy land to flea nor will i bow to those who blame and for such law would deal m shame
then said the eunuch to z ala machan bees we would bee o my lord
o my lord continued the eunuch and shahrazad perceived that the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
we will do thee no arid o my son nor wrong thee in aught but our object is that thou bent thy gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and returning wheel and safety and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news
then the eunuch went out to zu machan and said to him reside what verses thou knowest for my ladies here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition
and also these
then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit
when the eunuch saw these case he wandered that them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
after awhile they came to themselves and whose al zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression laughed her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the kun and what had happened to her with the bai how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brothers shar kin and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of mine how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the king their sire had sent and asked for her from sharpen
but now go to thy master and break him quickly to me
the chamberlain called castrato and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the talker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girding his ass and preparing for flight
she said it hath reached me a auspicious king that when the talker girted he as for flight and bespake himself saying oh would i knew what is become of him
i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence the pages at about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime
why didst thou say i never repeated these couplets nord do i know who remitted them when it was it thy companion
but now i will not leave yee between this place and that doub and what betideth thy comrade shall be tide thee
was as i feared the cals discerning but on to allah we are all returning
then the eunuch cried upon you the pages saying take him off the ass
and he answered i the chamberlain of the emir of damascus king sharpen sang over margin al newman lad bac dad and of the land of kor san and a bringing tribute and presence from him to his fathering bagdad
so fairy forwards no harm shall befall you till you join he grant wa ear than done
then he bad him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was trembling to the emir of damascus and was bound to king omar with presence and the tribute of syria
so it was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the king's son sharpen and may came sultan over his father's rail
and amongst them where some who would have chosen the cadet zau machan for quoth they his name be light of the place and he hath a sister nu hart al zaman hies the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for all he jasp and none wotteth what is become of them
so he turned to the wazir du dan and said to him readily your tale is a wonder of wonders
no o chief w ear that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bring uh you your desire after the easiest of fashions for let his almighty will restore it to you zahm kan and his sister nuzhat al zaman whereby we will settle the matter as be easily can
when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with grey joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the twain and what befell them and the cause of their long absence
zaman bowed his hadad awhile and then said i accept the position p indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and sat him on the right way
then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharpen
after a while the dust dispersed and there appeared under the army of bagdad and khorasan a conquering host like the pool tide sea and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
when it was the seventy eighth night
any neat or rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place
lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zau machan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and sires son speer
moreover the sultan commanded his wazir undone coal at ten day's halt of the army that he might be private with him and learned from him how and wherefore his father had been slain
he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days
what had happen to me

mister marble he oud to breed was fairly newsy of the he coops pam like the sailors as one might say very asleep
at that moment and an noise when the marriage se men that of an oar falling in the boat
i think yet sell ho and close abroad
he w drums of the seaman to require second look and order to ascertain but was to be none
on though they went three feet too hard too this gave it a ma of freezing time
as our seat were all flying forward remained so for a fewe minutes became melee to to look about
i soon saw bot pox in glad enough was i should perceive that they had not a posing terribly near
mister cat er it saw sone remark that are movements had been so prompt hesitate the lass was aback
a print still this seceded
the prides did not alter the course but near nuts fast
i heard the ringer the boarding pipes to as they were cut adrift from this s pinker boom and fell upon the decks
kind lent out and turned with three or form husks and as many pipes
the stills that ranged boat sides was might that of death
the john behaved beauti free he came round right at tar
the question was now whether we could pass them were not before they got noon up to gr apple
and captain behaved perfectly w its critical andes command in and dead sim as and clods intents int to his orders
n so board the johns heart
when or san we gave the gentlemen that four seeks is to out the news and to hic the stern most provable which with deal near a tables leath that sent
they were night these of fiend in english
i doubt if retouches the man in the needs pa
b state the ship pats ahead of her canvass be full leaving the pros most its in her wake
they swarmed up and front a servant's palings as thick as they could jam together and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise
some sung out per down the fence tear down the fence
the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
scherbinin run his eye slow along the crowd and where ever its struck the people tried a little to out gaze em but they couldn't they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
the average man's a coward
because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back in the dark and its just what they would do
so they always a quit and then a man goes in the night with a hundreds mast cowards at his back and lunches the rascal
you didn't wanted to come
but a mob without any man at the head of at his beneath pitifulness
now lead and take your half a man with you tals and he is gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every witch way and buck harness he healed it after them lookin tolerable chee
he can't beat keep careful
a argue an tri to keep him out but he wouldn't listen an a whole show come to a his stan still
and one or two women begin to scream
so then the ring master he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could s stay on the horse
it warn't funny to me though i was all but tremble to see his danger
and a horse a going like a house afire too
he shed him so thick the kind of clod up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits
why it was one of his own min
an but never mind a rest of his outfit it was jess wide but it was awful funny
the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered it off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and haw hard till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do another time
twenty people sings out
the duk says yes
everybody sings out sold
but a big fine lookin man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on
jest a word gentlemen they stop to listen
what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up an sell the rest of the town
you bet it is the judge is right everybody sings out
we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a wor
we never show de light till we was about ten mile below the village
green horns flat heads

now d du he's a tolerable like of man in some ways
this one's a middlin hard lot for a dupe
when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and morning to himself
it don't seem natural but i reckon it so
he was often moning and mourning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying ho little elizabeth
donned you hear me shut dad do
i lay i make you mine
jest as loud as i could yell
which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to how
the canes duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy
why before he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when he'd take off his new white beavers an make a bow an do a smile he looked that grand and good an pious that you'd say he'd walk right out of the ark and maybee was old of vitiges himself
jim cleaned up the canoe an i got my pier ready
were you bou or young man
get aboard says the king
i done so an then we all three started on again
the young chap was mighty thankful z a was tough work toting his baggage such weather
p asked de king where he was going and the king told him he'd come down to river and landed at the other village this mornin and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend a farm up there the young fellow says
but then i says again no i reckon it ain't him or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river you ain't him are you
no my name's bliant alexander oblige reverend alexandr oblige it i s'pose i must say as i'm worn of the lars poor servants
you see he was pretty old and george's goody earls was too young to be much company for except mary jane the red hitting and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didn't seem to care much to it

flam de feed acquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkes and about peter's business which was a tanner and about georg which was a carpenter and about harvest which was a dissenting minister and so on and so then he says
when her deep they won't stop for a hail
was peter wilts well off
when w struck the boat she was a bout done loading and pretty soon she got all
now hustle back right off an fetch the duke c here and the new carpet bags
so then they waited for a steamboat
but the king was kar he says
they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would they tell you
then want of them says kind o soften jim
phelps is one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look alike
i wait around a climb over the back style by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen
i out with a yes'm for i thought
so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
when we got there she set me down in a split bottom chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
well it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt
an i think he died afterwards he wu a baptist
yes it was mortification that was it
your uncle's bin up to the town everyday to fetch you
you must met him on the road didn't you og wish man with a
wh child it'll be stow
it was kinder thin eyes but i says
i had my mind on the children o a time i wanted to git them out to one side and pumped them a little it find out who i was
pretty soon she made the cold chill streak all down my bac because she says
i see it warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
so i says to myself here is another place where i got to rest the truth
i opened my mouth to begin but she grab me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes
children don't you say a word
i see i was in a fixed now
missus phelps she jules for him and says
h he come no says her husband
i can't imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy
uneasy she says i'm ready to go distracted
he must a come and you've missed him along a road
oh don't distress me any more n already distressed
why silas look yer up the road ain't that somebody comin
the old gentleman stared and says
i hain't no i dare who is it
is palm sawyer
being time sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stay easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coffin along down the river
then i says to myself s'pose time server comes dan on that boat
but i am you you please that you have seen my lady
i knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you ye have seen but the worst of her
her conversations has more charms and can be in mere beauty and a humor and disposition would make a deformed person appear lovely
why didn you not send me that mews and a garland
why the best on it that i have a squire na that is as good as a night
in earnest we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish and occasions i cannot tell which is strangers
all the people that i had ever and my life refused were brought again upon the stage like richard the third's ghosts to reproach me withal in all the kindness discoveries could make i had for you was late to my charge
my bast qualities if i have any that our good served but for aggravations of my fault and i was allowed to have wit and understanding a discretion and others things that it might appear i had none in this
tis a stiles change and i am very sorry for it but i'll swearing or not how to help it
mister fish is a squire of things and has so many mistresses than anybody near pretender share in him and re believed that though i have the honour to be his near neighbor to speak freely i cannot brag much that he mak singly court to me and i know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often
i think my youngest brother comes bound with him
i can no sooner give you some little hints where about they live but you know them presently anent you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if i incline him to loo graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
i have missed four fits and have had but five and have recovered so much strength as may be venture to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
but besides i can give you others
i am here much more out of people's way than in town for my aunts in such h pretend and interest in me in a power over me do so persecute ment dear good nature i take it so ill that they are not accepted as i would live in a hor trey to avoid them
youll think him altered and if it be possible more melancholy than he was
if marriage agrees nor better with other people than it thus with him i shall pray that all my friends may escape it
well in earnest if i were prince that lady should be my mistress but i can give no rule to anyone else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing their hearts to her may be infinitely taken with one i should not value at all all ful so a justinian wis providence has ordained it that by de different humans everybody might find something to please them starves wal without envying their neighbours
the matter is not gray for i confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best pleased never to be known in it on any occasions whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly avoided one must satisfy oneself by doing nothing that one needed care knows
if i had a picture that were fit for you he should have it
how kingly talk of the flying fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine it you could
i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am certain he knows y utmost of the injuries you have received from her
we have had another to beat but much more calm me
then besides there was a time when we are so was when different to one another did i do so then or have i lend it since
i have been studying how tom cheek might come by his intelligence and i very believe he has it from my cousin peters
how kindly do i take the civilities of your father's in earnest you cannot imagine how his let appease me
would it' would leave me and then i could believe i shall not always of occasion for it
by poor lady vavasor is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against a protector and did not discover it
she has told now all that was told her but vows she will never say from whence she a it we shall see whether her resolutions errs unalterable as those of my lady talmash
i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
i never saw anyone yet that did not look simply and out of countenance whatever knew a wedding well designed but one and that was of two persons time enough i confess to contrive it and nobody to please invites
the truth is i could not endure to be missus bride in a publick wedding be made the happiest personal earth
do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather than fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
yet in ernest your father will not find my brother paid and wanting in civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters in me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set a higher value upon her sister and she deserves
my aunt told me no longer garden yesterday that i was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome to ked
you see i give you fell warning
by the next i shall be gone into kent in my other journeys laid aside which i am not displeased at because it would have broken o in to course very much
here are some blas is a colonies tell me all you like them
i told you in my last that my suff willed journey was lad aside and that into kant hastened
if i drowned by the way this will be my last letter n like a will i bequeath all my kindness to you in it for a charge never to b stout it all upon another mistress lest my ghost rise again and haunt to you
indeed i like him extremely and he is commended to me by people that know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than they i did not intend it so over i can assure you
i do not find her i am told i was so extremely when i believed you love me
but i am called upon
directed for your master
i see you can chin when you please and with authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded from a very good principle in me
we dare not that our tongues lie more in one side about mass and the other for fear of overturning it
you are satisfied i hope and this than i scape drowning
but i am troubled much you should make so ill the journey to saw little purpose indeed i writ by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters
oh welcome you will be but alas
for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to not decay an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission
they laughed to hear me say that one unkind word destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase everyday if it were possible but never lessen
we go broad all day and play all night and see our praise when weet time
wh in sober earnest now i would not live th a twelvemonths to gain all that kan h lost unless it were to give it him again
will you be so good nature
he has one son it isis to finest boy that ere saw and has a noble spirit be yet stands in that all of his father at one word from him is as much as twenty whippings
you must give me leave to entertain you else with discourses of the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
not to knowing you would come home i can assure you nor for any other catt on my own but with a cousin of my that had long designed to make herself spot with him and did not miss off her aim
in my life i never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for which could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
iver since this adventure i have had some great a belief in all things for this nature that i could not forbear laying a pease cot with nine peas int under my door yesterday' was informed by it that my husband's name should be thomas how do you like that
she put her hair down turned his good back put her feet on the fender and took part into her lap all of which arrangements sniped that something very important had got to be thought over and settled
the more proposal the more credit
after wight it unlighted and maybee d sis the consequence of that night's fun
just suppose it is true that he does ask me and pear yes
what a spiteful thing i am
i do so much for au at home how i should inside that
that me see how can i begin
he has known her all her lives and has a good influence over her
now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that weak for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided she missed the blessed little in the views that used to put a certain flavour of romans into her thar hot working days
i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or positions that knows attracted polly though these doubtless possessed the greater influence than she suspected
it was that indescribable something which women are quick to see in feeling men who have been pressed that vice and good mothers
this had an especial charmed to polly for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to everyone
lately this su changed especially towards parley and it followed her more than she would confess even to herself
at first she tried to think she could that unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even certitude
party felt a very cordial friendship for mister sydney but not one particle of the loa they the only kind in which laugh c be tully paid
this finished polly's indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl that the spies of the old eve in her composition
when sat t came polly startled as usual for visit to back he and best but couldn not resist stopping at the shores to leave pass of a fen d was calling time
a foolish little speech to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tender heed girl trying to her duty
take hold of massa charley's hand miss maybee and w pretty like willie and flossie said the mate
at the street corner a black eyed school poy was parting from a rosy face school girl whose music w he was reluctantly surrendering
how he got there was never very clear to pony but there he was flushed and a little out of pip but looking so glad to see her till she had not the heard to bast off and cool as she had fully intended to be when they meant
chiny could not help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
that is the way a it to the was answered polly
she did not mean to tell but his as frankness was so agreeable she forgot herself
but i knowe her better and i assure you that she does improve she choice to mend her thoughts though she won't own it and who suppress you some day by the amount of heart and sense and goodness she has got
thank you no
h lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
asked the out for young man laying a drap into which polly immediately fell
he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being boot browed and generous resolved to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as pace hiss own
so and you made a last buoyant remarks he said quietly watching your face keenly all the while i thought so well i'm going out of town on business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me anny it
she thought she had a good deal of the coquet in her and i've no doubt that with time and draining she would have become a very dangerous from person but now she was far to trans paon and straight forward by nature evening to tell a white like lovely
he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorse for face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only love or she would ever have had read his answer and accepted it in servants
parley did not return to a favourite walk till she learned for minnie that uncle had ry left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the ways a pleasant
lugging too and four as usual but the news with you
perhaps she chill him
utterly done with and laid upon the shelf
many the other days she wished he was a pitch and so she could paddle in the bottles and not fuss above rebels
now don't be affected polly but just tell me like a dea has not he proposed
don't you think he means to
truly july fan
i don't mean to be prying but i really thought he did
oh i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have
i just gave him the hint and he took it
he meant to go away before that so then think his heart is broken or mind what city gentler say
he understood and being he a chan lumm and made no far
but parry it would have been a grand thing for you
i not you know and prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days
never mind what the business was its surfaces to say that it was a good beginning for a young men like town who having been borne and bread in the most conservative class of the most conceded city in your england needed just the healthy hardy social influences of the vest to writ in his views and make a man of him
fortunately everyone was so busy with the necessary probations that there was no time for romans of any sort and the four young people worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not butte up in their respective hearts
pity that the entred comes soon but the hour did its work and wend its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind but the younger folks did not see it them for their eyes within because of the partings that must be
if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a sum u town but sydney often called to his vacation came and the voluminous clo s bonds of poly beguiled belong days
time we at once a weak to his mother but the letters were sure in not very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women less liked to hear
no i'm only tired had a good dear so do lately and the dull weather mixes me chest a twel brew
forgive me polly but i can't up saying it for this there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can
au to i nother deceive myself but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me
thank heaven for that
cried poy with the hardiest satisfaction in her voice
poor parley was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say
none were needed her tee her their face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish bast which and the hundreds are after it
once or two ice but sort of chokingly and i thought it was only some little flirtations
it was juste cood of me not to guess before
it was so tender earnest and defiant but anny forgot the defense of her own lover and admiration of police loyalty to hers for this faithful all absorbing laugh was a newer relations to fanny who was used to hearing her friends best of two or three lovers a year and calculate their respective fairies with almost as much coolness as the young men discussed fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to marry
i hope maria bailey's only things she added softly for i could not bear to happen disappointed again
said fanny turning hopeful all at once
suppose i say a word to tom just inquire after his heart in a general way you know' gi him a chance to tell me if there is anything to tell
bear it people always to pay thing somehow answered polly looking as if sentence had beens upon her
it was a very different winder from the last both the girls
if anny wondered to show him what she could do towards making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded ber than she suspected for in spite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mister sydney att least for he was more the house friend than ever and seemed determined approve the change of fortune made not diffuse to him
she kept much at home in the day's work was done funning it pleasant to a s streaming of a book or soon alone than to exert herself even to go to the shores
polly was not at all like herself that winder and those news to her saw in wonder at it most
for ned was so absorbed in business that he excelled the whole baily question and left them in other darkness
fy came bagging in upon one day looking as if she poured tidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them
but if work baskets were giv it with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any re read
she had even been in society before the revolution
it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext
every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monseigneur saint fro gave it to m seigneur sa julian masse said julian gave it to monseigneur saint eves m sieur saint toss gave it to monsignor sain procopius et cetera et cetera
and the schoolgirls were begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under the veils charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers frown
it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
the rule of font did not forbid this
she would not show the objects anyone
thus that furnished a subject of comment for all those who were on occupied or bo in the convent
some unique chaplet some authentic relic
they lost themselves and conjectures
wh the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making and effort to fly but the dancers laughing with a satanic air

general observations on preserves confectionery ices and dessert dishes
the expence of preserving them with sugar is a serious o subjection for except a sugar is used in considerable qualities the success is very uncertain

the reason that if fort is emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pants are usually made
from this example the process of preserving fruits by sir would be easily comprehended
they should be dried in the stove or oven on a seed and turned every six or eight hours fresh powder sugar being sifted over them every time there turned
in this way it is also that orange in woman ghip are preserved
marmalades jams and fu past of the same nature and are now in they general quest
marls and jams differ little from each other there preserves of half liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits i am sometimes part of the reines with sugar
but they may keep it as necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen o three
in all the operations for preserved making when the preserving pain is used it should not be placed on the fire but on a tribute on mess the jim was mean on a hot plate when this is not necessary

there was on t on the time a widower from had a sodden and the daughter by his first wife
from the very daid the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the man's children and not a corner to be found what they could get any rest so the boy thought that the bestest thing he could do was top outed into the world and tried to his own bread
but his sister who was still at home fared wards and worse

at last they came in sid of land
while if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her casket into the sea
what is my brother saying asked his sisters again
on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchen maid who slept there to lend her a brush
she begged very prettily and got it and then she bushed her hair and the goal dropped from it
out on the ugly bushy brie sleeping so soft of a young king's side on sand and stones my bed i make and my brothers sleeps with the cold snake unpitied and unwept
i shall come twice more and then never again said she
this time also as before she bowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she slid the bell gout three times and when d dawned she departed but if she was going she said as she had said the floor i shall come once more and then never again
no one can tell how the light of the king was to get rid of that hideous bushy bride and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as day itself

for we are brothers said the princess whom nowt to have when now kiss tell the king what we eat and drink but there is a mighty toil who h has to spell over us

once upon a time there was a king in the north hope one many wars but now he was old
the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
so yes the queen how do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning and she said
then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
he is no bigger than other dragon said the tutor and if you were as ba with your father you would not fear him
then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dwarf who warned all the treasure and took it from him
al the one ring was left which the dwarf war and even that was taken from him
so regan made a sword and cigaret tried it with a blow in a lamp of iron and the sword broke
then sigurd went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's play and gave them to regan
so cigaret said that sword would do
then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley
but sigurd waited till half of him it called over the pit and then he thrust the sword graham right unto his very heart
sighed said i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
but all m die and no brave man let's death frighten him from his desire
guy thou fafner and then staff ner died
then sicker growed back and met rein and wigan asked him to roast fafner hiss heart and let him taste of it
sissy good put the heart of fafner on a steak and most at it
there's cigaret roasting faton's heart for another when he should taste of it himself and learn all wisdom

cosette had waked up
jean valjean had paced he near the fire
you will wait for me at a lady's house i shall come to fetch ye
everything is ranged and nothing is said fagel off all
i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
that's wear the difficulty lies
it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out
and she will hold her tell me i answer for that
for she yvonne grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean
you understand father madden the goverment m notice it
jean val jan stared him straight in the ian thought that he was raving
fuel liver went on
it is to morrow that i am to bring you in the priors expiry
then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community
that the nun who had dined that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel
that the priors and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil wish of the deceased
that he fauchelevent was to nail up the coffin in the cell raised the stone in the chapel and lower the corpse into the vault
and then that there was a ner the empty coffin
what is sat empty coffin
asked jee rajah fauchelevent replied
what coffin w administration
fauchelevent who was seated sprang up as though were omer had burst under his chair you
you know form caf what you have said mother' crease a fiction is dead
and i add and father madeline is buried r
you are not like other men saw the madeline
this offers the means but give me some informations in the first place
how long is the coffin six feet
it is a chamber on the ground floor has a grated windows oping on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shatter and two doors one leeds into the convent the other into the church what church
the church in the street that the church which any one can enter
have you the kings to those tudors
no i have the key to the door which communicates with the conrad the porter has the key to the draw which communicates with the catch
only to allow the undertakers men to enter when they come to get the coffin
who nays up the coffin i dy
who spreads the poor labor
not another man except the police doctor can enter the dad room that is e written on the wall
could you hide me in that ring to night when every one is asleep
about three and calking the afternoon
i shall be hungry ah i will bring you something
you can come and down me up in the coffin at two o'clock
fish liver recoiled and cracked his finger joins but that is impossible
bah impossible to take a hammer and drives nails in a pan
jean valjean had been worse straight the ms
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bail of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to e conies his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean's gloomy talents
you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will l on the top plancon loosely good and what if you should happen to carve for to sneeze
a man who is making his escape does not cough all sneeze
who is there who is not said to a cat do come in
the over prudent cats as they are and because they are can sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
but jean valjean's coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself he grumbled
if you are sure of coming out of the coffin right i am sure of getting out of the grave
an u o of the old school the great digger puts the corpses in the grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
i shall follow that is my business
there's halts the undertake his men not a rope around your coffin firm lower you down
the priests as the prayers makes the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
one of two things will happen he will either be sob all he will not be sober
that is settled father fuss l all what go well
on the fallen day as the sun was declining the very rare passers by on the boulevard di men hilled off their hats to an old fashioned hearse ornamented with skulls crass bones and tears
this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a hinge corpse with drooping arms
a morning coach in which could be seen a priest in his curls and a choir boy in his red cap followed
behind it came an old man in the garments of a labourer limped along
the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at might in winter in this cemetery they were subjected to a special discipline
these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalid
dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it
the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the rohan it hinted at poverty ph las chimes if you pe
to be buried in parlor chaise is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognized as elegant
the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the introduction of jean valjean into the dead room all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch let us roman in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly vial offense in uns
it is one of the faults which resent on duty
the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences
in the cloister what is called the government is only in intermeddling with authority and interference which is always questionable
make as many norse as you please men but keep them for yourselves
a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind
jean valjean's composure was one of those powerful tranquillity which are contagious
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
he played with father mien
he did what he necked with him he made him dance according to his wind
the permission for interment must be exhibited
he was a sort of labouring that who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm
the man replied the grey digger
the gave do not yes
you i
father miss jem for grave digger he was
flush of what had expected anything but this at a grave digger could die
it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do die themselves
he had hardly the strength to stammer
but he persisted feebly farther messia is the grave digger
do you know who l you father lena he isn't job of red wine
but you are a jolly villa
are you not common we'll gun have a drink together presently
the man replied
he limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity
the grave digg walked on in front of him
fauchelevent passed the unexpected cuvier once more in review
fauchelevent who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
the sir father nest tien is dead
the man replied completely
the good god consulted his notebook which shows when the time is up it was father most hen's turn forman died
stammered fauchelevent it is made
you are peasant i the parisian
fresh wore thought i am lost
there were only a few terms of the wheel distant from the small ary leading to the nun's corner
and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well
fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter reins clog of the wheels and retarded its speeded
my father was a porter at the bryan m tam home
but he have reverses he had losses on changed i was obliged to renounce the profession of author but i ames still a public writer
but so you are not a grave digger then
returned fauchelevent clutching at this branch feeble as it was
here a remark becomes necessary
a flush chivo was up his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
the great digger went on with a superior smile
one must eat
the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake
yes but if i should already ask for something what
well do it for me for i swear to you that don't love you as the others have loved you
there are bolts and the door wretch
i don't knowe how it is but it's seems to nance if i do
now go i cat keep my eyes open
it seems to me as if this sleeping city belongs to me i searched my memory for their names of those whose happiness i had on in envied and i could not recall one without finding myself the happier
education fly feeling the says of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sims so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first cast will of love all the more ardent because they seem so pure
the more girl believes in goodness the more isle will she give way if not tor lover and these to love for be without mistrust she is without force and to w her love as a triumphs that can be gained by any young men of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must they find it tempting how surely must be listen to the first voice which comes to tell it secrets through their bars and bless the hand which she is the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil
with them the body has worn out the soul the senses half burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
they loved by profession and not by instincts
when a creature who has all her past to reproach herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere irresistible love of which she had never felt for self capable when she has confessed her love how absolutely the man whom she loves dominates her
they know not to what proof to give
in order to disturb the laborers in the field was one day devoured by a wolfe because those whom he had so often deceived the longer belief in his cries for help
this is the same with these unhappy woman would they love seriously
but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough and soul to receded it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man drained at one drought all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
but to return to the first day of my lay son
when i re home i was in a state of mad gaiety
the woman becomes a man's mistress and loves him
how why
my whole beam was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night
here on my orders tonight at a vat deville
hander a third and trap
the boxes filled one after anotherin
only one remained empty a stage box
at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed opened and marguerite appeared
this she loved me enough to believe that the more beautiful she looks the happier i should be
what is the matter with you to night said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
he should go to bed she replied with that ironic error which went so well with her delicate and witty face
where at home
you still love me can you ask
because she don't like seeing him
none the less i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the county and marvell gain into the carriage which was winging for them at the door
i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
you in the way marguerite but how
well you might have had a woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive
during this remark marguerite looked at me attentively
my dear prudence i answered you do not know what you are saying
yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as as my door you would want to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
because i am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm
is that rally the only of reason
if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
on the sleet do care for me a little a great fal
i fancied for a moment that i might give myself that happiness for six months you would not have it you insisted annoying the means
well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
i listened and i gazed their marguerite would admiration
when i thought that this marvellous creature whose feet i had once long to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts by part in her life and that i was naught yet content with what she gave me i asked if man's desire had indeed limits when sat spied as probably it mine had been it reached after something further
truly she continued we poor creatures of chance have fantastic desire and inconceivable loves
we are not allowed to have hearts u the penalty of thing hut it down and of ruining are credit
we no longer belong to ourselves
who stand first in their self est stained last in their steam
never do give you advice which is not lucratively
it means little w off to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they get dresses or a brace ling out of them and that they can drive in are a para from time to time or come to our box at
such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and old a is neither protects nore consols
i thought i could have set the life which he offered me but what would you have
what i loved and you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
marguerite hired out with this long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough pull up her the chief tor lips and from that to her eyes
marguerite do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but in the name of heavens tear up the letter which are wrote to you and do not made me leave you tomorrow it would kill me
marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
here it is i have brought the back
i tore letter into fragment and kissed with tears the hand i gave it to me
look here prudence do you know what he wants said marguerite
he want you to forgive him
one has too but he wants more than that what then
i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled
all mister puer grinned
this sounded like another story
he was curious about that black headed cousin of all mister buzzard very curious indeed
anyway he would find out

they liked to choke that no compas or to death
when he get home he tri tri to bush the suit off but the done get into the skin and it stay there
a little sigh of satisfaction went round the circle of listeners

forthwith the grinning jester began sure eking with laughter so that the bells upon his motley cap were all said a jangling
i did but laugh to think the sword of ehlert had been so quickly fouled responded the jester and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailor's girdle
one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near hand in the bushes
thou shalt have thy liberty he cried even though thou shouldst run me in pieces the moment thou art free
it had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful fy with filmy wings which shone like rainbows in the moonlight
at this moment there was a distant rumbling is of thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten
scissors grow a giant's height and save us from the ogre's might
he could see the ogre standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the chasm and gnashing his teeth each one of which was as big as a mill still
the sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him
thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this dismal spot while i have the power to help thee
he lifted the scissors and with one stroke to strode the web and gave the flights read e
a fain glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole
the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to thinking a suitable verse to say to the scissors
as he uttered the words the scissors leaped out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shutters as easily as through a chafes
in a very short time the prince had crawled to the opening
while he stood looking around him in bewilderment a firefly alighted down his heart flashing its little lantern and the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me to guy do to who a place of safety

he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
to stand between two religions from one of which you would not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to that like souls
marius was clear eyed and he required the true light
the half lights of doubt tamed him
whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
his discomfort was augment by all the reflections which occurred to him
in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
they soon elbowed him abruptly
request go for a to come and talk with me said marius
what is to become of you said courfeyrac
what are you going to do i do not know
silver gold here it is

that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundreds sou very slowly
one morning on his returned from the los school marries found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistol that is to say six hundreds francs in gold in a sealed box
maria sent back the thirty louis to his aunt with the respectful letter in which he stated that he had suspicious means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs
at that moment he had three francs left
he perceived that it was no good talking to the old men and at the principal person in the house was the mother
before her he decided a scatter his pearls
the princess was distracted and d dun know what to do she felt she had sent against kate
well doctor decided our fad said the princess tell me everything
he's their hold she meant to say but her looks quivered and she could not out of the question well door
as he wised the princess went out of the sigh
the family doctor respectfully ceased in amid li of his observations
and there are indications metricians nervous in sita ability and so long
the question sands thus and presence of indications of to berg of this process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
yes set an understood thing responded the eel rad physician again glancing in his watch
beg pardon as thews gi bridge dana or shall have the drier on
he asked ah it is
oh well then i can do it in twenty minutes
and how about it to abroad asked the co doctor
what is wanted is the meed im proving nutrition enough allowing
the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
but in favor foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions call ap mines
and then the mother wishes it he had
ah well not pas to be sure let them go only those drowning quicks are mischievous
oh times up already and he went to the dol
the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling if what was due from him dictated his doing so that he ought to see the nation once more
oh no only if odious princess come this way
and the mother a company by the doctor went into the drawing room to get
when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tears
she answered in and all at once got up furious
excuse me doctor but there is really no logic in this
this is the third tim you've asked me the same thing
the celebrated doctor did not take offence
nervous s irritability he said to the princess when she had left the room however i'd finished
and the doctor began significantly explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certainly harmless
at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged in the deep meditation as though resolving a weeky problem
finally his decision was bernous they were to go abroad but to put no fate in foreign quacks and to apply to him and any need
it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had young
the mother was much more cheerful as she went back to her daughter and ken he pretend to be more cheerful
educated people of the upper places are trying to stifled ever brewing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing socials
this is absently in correct
in the social conception of life it supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the enters of the group
the champions of the social conception of light usually trying to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
the men who was controlled by moral influence assent accordance with his own desires
the basis of authority as bodily whiles
the possibility of applying bodily violence the people is provided above all by an organization of armed men train to act in unison and submission to one will
these bands of armed men said miss it to a single will are the constitute the army
the army has always been and still is the basis of power
power is always in the hands of those who control army and al men and power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything in court popularity of the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
indeed it could not be otherwise
only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
the since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
even if there was one a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition of men of violence the existence of authority to restrains such blace was an advantage because the violence of the government was less than the violent of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
between the members of one state subject to a single authority the stride between the individuals seemed still less and a life of the state seems even more secure
it was produced on one hand by the natural grove the population and on the other by struggling goggles
after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
but this justification is never more than temporary
internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression deserted by the authority over the dissentient individuals
governed authority even if it do suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
and therefore the oppression of the oppress always goes on growing off the furthest woman beyond which it cannot go ab killing the goose with the gold nice
the most convincing example this is be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient tim su abu by conquest
so it is always been
footnote this fact that in america the uses of authority exist in spite of a small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position de positively confirms it
the upper clusters know that an army of forth thousand will soon be in sufficient and no longer belong on incense men they feel that is curt of their position depends on the increase drink of the army
the reason to which he gave expressions essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the pope's engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of the day so carefully distributed the refutes so that the regiments from the fronty or their stationed in central districts and the regiments from the centre are stationed on the frontiers
the meaning of c privy speech put into plan language is it funds are needed not to foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the in slave toiling masses
and this abnormal order of thanks is maintained by the army
but there is not only one goverment there are other governments exporting their such as by violent in the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its in slave subjects
and so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its neighbor brigands
this increases contagious as montesquieu pointed out add fifty years ago
everye increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defence against its subjects becomes a sort of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
the despotisms of a government always increases with the strength of the army and as external successes and the residence of a government increases with its internal despotism
the rivalry of the european states and constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse the universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers who obtained at the least possible express
and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practised upon them all citizens have become their own impresses
this inconsistency has become obvious and universe in thord service
in fact the whole significant of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transition a personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life the groups of cur cans
but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had met to avoid
but inst of doing that they exposed to individual to the same necessity of strife such study strike with individuals of other states for strife with neighbours
the taxes rays from the people for war preparations of sor of the graved part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
the danger of war ever ready to break out winners all reforms of lie social like vain and fruitless
but the fat insignificance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent and the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
government assert that armies are needed above all for external defence but that is not true
there are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an accomplice in all that acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
and for the sake of what are making them
im expected for the sake of a state to make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
except with the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish the number that there can only be done by change of evarin and moral influence
so that the justification of stained violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil suppose persons even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago has none whatever now
except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education cultural means a punic and sore
without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything
this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in forming societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
without governments nations were be slided by their neighbors
the government they tell us with its army is necessary defends from neighboring states who might in slabs
and if defence against barbarous nations iss meant one thousand part at the troops now under aunts would be amply sufficient with that purpose
the power of the state are from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes on the contrary the much greater danger of such tacks
even looking at it practically weighing that is to say all the burdens lid on him by the states no man can failed to see that for him personally to comply with a state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantages than to refuse to do so
to resist would need independent thoughts and efforts of which every man is not capable
so much for the advantages of disadvantages is of both lines of conducts for a man of a wealthy class and oppressor
for a man of the poor working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages
say you know supper
chris looked from maul plated flash like to a car jack can spark plug
no news a jump ban that's jine harris

chris star it off once more passing a bleak little victory and church perched on hill of mister work's house
an empty lot cut in into by church lane gave a look of isolations of ale shaped brick building in sir mister wicker's both house in place at business
no longer wing towards back back door that opened on a water street the space between the house from the gonsalvo had been made into a meat op along fler garden fenced off for the sidewalk by box shrugs in the white picket fence
a livid yellow stained theorizing beyond the factories and lay clouds lowered and tumbled above
the air was growing chill and christ sided the finished the job
all at once he wondered how his mother was and everything in him and pinched and tightened itself
at the foot of the hill and he reached the house
there were three things that always caught his eye a meant the litter of dust he pieces
otter left the coil of rope in the center the model of a sailing ship in a grain glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of the negro boy and baggy trousers turkish jacket and white turban
but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe at home in bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabelle
he had never seen any one' go into mister wicker's shop now he thought of bed
how then did he a lamp and what did ever sell
a sudden car horn walk him from his dream
and the many times e ex ain mister workers when now and poured over the rope the ship and the nubian boyd never gone into mister wicker's shop
some now alone till someone should answer the bell they looked eagerly yet uneasily around him to
but with one windows in the lower and day outside a long narrow shop with sombre
had the hand beams crossed it from one side to the other
mister hooker's back being toward the source of light chris cannot see his face
the double fans a minute wrinkles breaking from ee cornered a temple anden joining with those over the shee bones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the dome forehead
lyle tops some white fuzzy above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarians hair but what drew and held chris's gaze with the old man's eyes
crisp linked and looked again yes they were still there
chris swallow it is vice came backed e

he's a school made of min
jenie harris's name is new reeling is the job
i i just pondered if the place was to lop
what he saw was a fresh chee lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humour in his face and something sated and appealing about his eyes
and guess there it must be lively fire from that room beyond
with that fear with jakie gig skinning the job sir
but even as he slowly turned the thoughts pierced his minds why do not seen the reflection of the headlights at the cars moving upo round the coy of wall er street not the hill towards the lick signals
the rome seemed overly still
then in that second turn and faced about
the wide bow wing it was there before him and three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that toward in from across the water
a chris the water where is the free way
it was no longer there no were the high walls and smoke stacks of factories to be seen to
the warehouses were still there
flabbergasted and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer a peer out the windows in every direction
electric signs no lap lid streets
when the people's dro store and stood but half an hour before rose the ruse of what was evidently an in

the learning of magick was by means easy
he told his master at once he bought simon goesler is hoard of money is hiding places for it
chris therefore threw himself and of all the prime in areas in his tasks
one afternoon when he had returned after arrest to mister wicker's study he saw that there was something new in the room a ball with a gold fishing it stood on the tablet that mister wick was not to be seen
what should all i do first

mister worker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for christ to get up his courage
that is nothing happened with a voice like a whip mister wiggs started mons
a sensation spread faster and faster
his head swab and he felt fainting a little sick but he persisted through the final words
he thought know without a feeling of pride and commenced experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight that some little time e laced before mister wicker's voice boom but oss by
seventy four book one the returns
the figure's shoes carved in some eastern style a curved up pointing toes
that all at once the idea came to chris
if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
he squatted on his haunches ex aven the carved wood and figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companions
but how did one a change inanimate to en of
chris got up and stole back to mister work's door
he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his ram above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was reeling empty we sir doom's proper shape and opened the doors of the cupboard at far end of the room
the afternoon raining before increased in storms
thus game two hours before its time thunder snarled in the sky
certain elements were to be mixed and poured the proper time
mister worker began moving about upstairs the full boards creaked pray and still chris could not leave until the foot fumed and glowed
with infinite caution chris closed the doors silently behind him in running light before ward greeks to figure the negro boy
it was as it the step mis melted
under his eyes wile told of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its rounding upon the coat and oh the face
the wind grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of car flowers moved a the bouquet ful

certainly my boy boomed out the captain as blue eyes abruptly keen and pen tray
mister finney wan be some time on deck we cannot be own heard in here
his face rose with nervousness that this might doll do was an answer and he stood stiff and stone before captain b lizards
the captain sat forwards in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say i do
the ship it more to me than wife or mother all family
and pause fingering this lower lip looking sideways in an reflective fashioned at chris standing before him
we shall say no more but i trust you understand the responsibility you have
the ship its cargo in its men' be in your hands
yes sir i think i can do it safely or i should not try sir
captain lizard's round pink faced creased in its winning smile
you then went on to descry what else was to father the covering in the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
the cam off losh was not a word the captain or anyone else of his time he had understood
what can be said during that time sir chris thought ask
i am somewhat skills in medicaments i have to be as a captain of ship and crew know it

there was nothing very brotherly in his look as he peared into a bale sharp features during the process
there don't mind me she said sharply and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle he had just set down and went swat w to her room

the acts said that in a of difference of at opinion there must be about
he went up to the table and striking it with his fingering he shouted loudly a ball
he was shouting for the very coarse surge even of which had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole panty and doubted in our opposition to it the same vindictiveness though in a more seemly fall on the other side
shouts were raised and for a moon all his confusion so that the martial of the province had to call for odour a ballot
we shut out blood for our country

they expressed the most implacable hatred
levin did not in the least understand what was a matter and he marvelled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the position above flare off should be put to the vote
he forgot as so jan of which explained to him afterwards this helgi sen that it was necessary for the public good to get r of the marshal of the province but to get it to the martian it was necessary to have a majority of wards that to get a majority of boards it was necessary to securer furs right to aboot that to secured the recognition of firs wit boat they was decided on the interpretation to be put on the act
but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respects in such an unpleasant in viciously state of excitement
to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the freshman bar
he particularly liked the way one brie wis gard waiter who showed us gone for the other younger was and was dured at by them was teaching them how to fold of napkins properly
living advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much em bars he turned to so g even average with the questions where the moray to putt it

that is a matter for each man's own dion he said se rely
having put it e he recollected that he oughter thrust his left hand too and so he thrust at it though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the bag round

but the old party did not consider themselves conquered

this expression in the marshal's face was particularly touching to levin because only the day for he had been at his house about his trusty business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kind hearted fatherly man
if there amen younger and more deserving than i let themselves
and the marshall disappeared through a side door
they were to proceed immediately to the election

said levin but going to her thought that had struck him
there's a class instinct too of what one ought an o n to do
there's the peasants too a wander of them sometimes any goode peasant tries to take all the land he can
without a return too as a simple loss
when he came from the bath process visited him again
but hermon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honor of the seventeenth birthdays of the old sculptor eu fail
she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour
so the artist found himself obliged to relinquish opposition
the banquet was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing daffy and telling her the words of the oracle
he longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescued demeter might yet be the work of myrtles had again mastered him
the approval as well as a doubts which had arise in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing into harmony with the facts
then he went directly to the neighbouring pace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husbands had rendered and impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy
when hermon entered the residence of the grammaticus in the palace the guests had already assembled
the place by heron's side which al thee had chosen for herself would then be given up to arina
true an interesting conversations still had powered to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight u referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyments blindness debarred him
a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and woman to whom no tad bound him save the presence of the same host
creates had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair haired nic had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to singing ar sensed praises among his professional associates
his son had been the royal dam's first husbands and she had deserted him to marry lis makest the aged king of thrace
the king's sister the object of his love cried harmon incredulously
we woman are only as old as we look and the legs entiring woman of this beauty of forty practise odds which give her the appearance of twenty five yet perhaps the king values her intellect more than hai person a the wisdom of a hundreds serpents is certainly united in this woman's head
the three most trustworthy ones are hear amass the liege chrysippus in the admirable process
let us hope that you will make this three leaved clover the luck promising four leaved one
your uncle too has often with praise worthy generality helped auto in many in embarrassment
how long he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the hale city was delight
when he did finally semen you he fed things which must have wounded you
that is going to far replied hermon
he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how gracious the arsenal had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in roads
the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interests and alpa eagerly confirmed the statement
her moms into the parents silence
the rodion was just beginning to praise ar sow also as a special friend and connoisseur of the sculptures art when crates her mons fellows student asked the blind artist in be this beautiful companions why his meter was placed upon a pedestal which to others as well as himself seemed too high for the size of the statue
yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of sky at him
a woman who yearns for the regard of all men and makes love a toy easily lessons the demands she imposes upon individuals
only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and alca did not wish to lose hero's regard
how indifferent you look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you was still a genuine creating artist the case was different
those so louder denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no idle delusion and snake me i can prove
it was nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
not a sound if you value your lives
to offer resistance would have been madness for even harmon perceived by the loud clanking of weapons round them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prison in the place of execution
was he to be led to the executioner's block
what pleasure had life to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art
o he not to greet his su an end as a boom from the immortals
did it not spare him a humiliation is great and painful as could be imagined
whatever might await him he desire go better fate
if he had passed into annihilation he herb wished to follow him thither an annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
but if he were destined to meet his fertil and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not tell them how sure he was a finding a joyful reception there from both
the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was nin nemesis no there was a kindly deity
yet it was the allusion that deceived him
again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
sometimes with the touching entreaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate a mistake
lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philip her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
cried harmon and grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and followed the soldier whom the captain detail to guide her into the palace
to morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path
daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philip a silenced tar with a grave exclamation the order of the king
as soon as the captive artist was alone with a woman he loved he cased her hand pouring for it incoherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly returned the pressure he could not restrain the desire to class perch was heart
in spite of his deep mantle distress he could have shouted aloud in his delighting gratitude
he might now have been permitted to find forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the palest the following morning still healed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought not to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impulse he exclaimed you know that i love you
i love you and have loved you always
damning exclaimed tenderly what more's needed
but harmon with drooping head murmured to morrow i shall no longer be what i am now
then dab he raised her face to his asking so the demeanors the work of myrtles
put a terrible or deal again awaits you
and i fool plied also on mind could be vexed with you for it
bring this before your mind and everything else you must accept with it if you consent with a time arrives to become mine conceal i pali nothing
so are kites intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day
he himself on the way to expose him themself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
his heart contracted painfully it is solicitude about his uncle's fate increased when philip and warmed him that the conspirators had been rested at the banquet and headed by ames the roan chrysippus and propos had perished by the executioner's sword at sunrise
besides he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one lust word
on the way his hard throbbed almost to bursting
even and ann's image and what threatened her father and her with him was seated far into the background
he was appearing before his companions only to give truth it's just do
the egyptian obey and his master crossed the wide space strewn with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the feal performances even had his eyes retained the power of sight his bud was coursing so wildly through his veins that he might perhaps have been enabled to distinguish the statues round him and the thousands of spectators who crowded closely together richly garlanded their cheek s glowing with enthusiasms surrounded the arena hermon
shouted his friend s aulis and joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk hermon
even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeter he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithful to his art and his nature
honour to merciless and his art but he trusted the snow feast dell assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception and a his prayer for recovery

so be it then replied the counts and extending his hand to wass a calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said to days the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o'clock now promised me to remember this and expected me the twenty first of me at the same hour in the forenoon

he dwelt with considerable forth and energy on the almost magical hospitality had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof our trace of all these events save the small yor seen in the distant arisen driving under full sale tow port or becum

but said franz the kuan bandits that were amongst the crew of his vessel
why really the thing seems to meet simple enough

i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from hands of senior vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outwards appearance of ease and and concerned i did not very particularly care to remain
and this time it must be confessed that contrivers of the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's side
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear his count for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation
and now my dear franz let us talk of some the else

busted his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair
gad explained the colonel
the very pair i was going to buy
look here colonel do you know anything about this
and the detective's professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
i happened to see those candlesticks in the windows of single font shop the other day and i made up my mind to buy them when i had a chance
now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen
thought i don't know whether that's his first or his last name anyhow he had a parker named sheerly
anyhow he infected get long very well it seems
neighbours often heard him scrap and al and this afternoon they went at it again that hawk and heavy
toward dark a man went int to bu lamp
he found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was all east body with the head busted in in this heavy candlestick near it
sure held so tight we could hard to get it out
maybe the fight was about who o on the watch for the dagoes talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbours could tell what they were safe i see
and the watch have you it y asked the tre
that's the watch announced the headquarters detective reaching in for it going at see
you're not a scream wishes all that are you just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's
and donna's voice was plainly sceptical

before the big wind at ireland suggested thong with the nodded desirous compatriot slightly to have the colonel
that's rout agreed the colonel as it continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
in a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the time piece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a lead pencil
and dan take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it
has the surprise detective yes
don't scratch yourself on it whatever you do why not
simply because this watch
someone out her to see you
all i met here in a second
singa fut was the panting answer
i want to talk over darcy's case with you the colonel had said and the two had talked had thoughts had talked again and now were silent for a time
what are the church of getting him off legally if we go lighted from a negative standpoint asked the colonel
rather ay of medical question colonel but i should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition
had best he would get off for the scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn't wants that nor do i
and you ii to wanted either
but i want to know just where we stand now i know
but i need to do a little more smoking out first now ill want to think
if you'll excuse me i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may kat something

the old adage of two hedgerow
yes it' still holles good
no alimony replied the coronel puzzled yes just that
and there's no reason you shouldn't know
chuckled the colonel as he skilfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook
and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip in now limp fish into the creole colonelcy gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
the reasons she asked no alimony inquired kenneth
no i mustn't thinking of that
however don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough for to day

it isn't generally ow went on the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him
it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of a baser sort
you don't mean that large struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did
the colonel did not disclose the facts that it was no news to him
ar grafton statement was being unexpected great confirmed
he remembered that cynthia and grafton had once been in love with each other
she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer
because large made no defence
large by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
so i had to let her have her way and muta last the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel fee
no but he will or i'll son him and get judgment oh he'll pay all right
and it takes all sorts of first us to make it up
still i would like to know
the murder of missus darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweller was tried
it had a double reputations to speak
grave and even revered the conventions assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper if not better class were frigidly seen in its dining room or cafe
large himself was a peculiar characters
in a smaller place he would have been called a saloon keeper
and it was this man rich over said ha some certainly that sent the a retford had married
to this was the answer whispered money
and in a way was true
she also sawed opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges
after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the larch hotel it could hardly be called a home became the scene of many festive occasions
then it was said of large that shone after the echoes of the wedding times had died away he had begun to treat his wife for the refined cruelty that hidden away from the publick underneath his habitual matter there was the wrongness of the brute
but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less off on represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smirched are who had not yet acquired any and were rolling to take a chance
it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me in the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be seeing there kenneth explained to the colonel
meanwhile colone lesley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he sab darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something to be done always returned the answer
don't weary it will come out all right
i'm going to rectify them but i will take time
it's hard from mis mace and too although she's bearing up like a major

i said where have you been remarked together we've missed you
i said i was galling he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an efforts
bi polonius someone asked
because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
there was a rattle of coin on the mahogany bars king sought to disentangle a single bill from the waded up currency at his pocket
it's it's an odd coining an old roman one that missus darcy had in private collection kept in the jeweler's door safe was the whispered answer
i went over them near the day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed
that was hers went on the dure

even the sun came out pale and watery at known

behold a ship was making for the island through the dash and sea and clashing waves
hearing this i was sore troubled remembering what i had before suffered from the ape kind
upon this he brought me a cotton bag and given it to me said take this bag and fill it with pebbles from the beach and g forth with a company of the townsfolk to whom i will give a charge respecting thee
do as they do and belike thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land
then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pebbles
to these he committed me commending me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how together that he may get his daily bread and you will earn your rewards and recompense in heavens
now sleeping under these trees were many apes which when they saw us rose and fled from us and swarmed up amongst the branches whereupon my companions began to pelt them with what they had in their bags and the apes fell to plucking of the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk
we weighed anchor and shahrazad perceived the dawn of the day and ceased saying o permitted say
when it was the five hundred and fifty ninths night
and ceased not sailing t we arrived safely at vassar
there i abode a little and then went on to bagdad i entered my quarter and found my house it were gathered with my family and saluted my friends it gave me joy of my safe return and i laid up all my goods and valuables in my store houses
after which i returned to my old merry way of life and forgot all i had suffered in the great prophet and gain i had made
next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawn prayer and after blessing mohammed the cream of all creatures betook himself to the house of sinbad the seaman and wished him a good day
here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales therein
happily mongst he is one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up and all in everything on board of her were plunged into the sea
but at burneth in their bellies so they cast it up again and it congeal ash on the surface of the water whereby its colour and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it ashore and the travellers and merchants who know it collected and sell it
each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides and after little the rest of my fellows perished one by one till i had buried the last of the party and a abode alone on the island with but a little provision left i who was wont to have so much
but there is majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great
when it was the five hundred and sixty first knight
then signed for myself i set to work collecting a number of pieces of chinese and corner and aloes wood and i bound them together with robes from the wreckage then i chose out from the broken up ships straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the allows wood making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel of the stream and i tied it tightly and firmly as though it were nailed
land after land shalt thou see c and find but no other life on thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul and they thoughts are night al bo shall lend or sooner or late
i rode my conveyance into the place which was intensely darkly and the current carried with a raft with it down the underground channel
and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft by reasons of the narrowness of the channel whilst the stream ceased not to carry me along knowing not night from day for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me about in my terror and concerned for myself lest i should perish
when i awoke at last i found myself in the light of heaven an opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft mud to an islands in the midst of a number of indians and ab sins
but i was delighted at my escape from the river
when they saw i understood the night and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace be with thee ow my brother
on my brother answered he we a husbandman u tills of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding thee asleep on this raft laid hold of it and made it fast by us against thou should us awake at thy leisure
i answered for a lad's sake and my lord ere i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after asked me what thou wilt
when it was the five hundred and sixty second night
she said it had reached me our auspicious king that sinbad the seamen continued when i landed and found myself amongst the indians and abyss and had taken some rest they consulted amongst themselves and said to one another there is no help for it but we carry him with us and present him to our king that he may acquaint him with his adventures
so i consorted with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respects
so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing to set out with the merchants for that i pined after my people and mine own land
quoth he thou art thine own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us on o head nice be it for thou gladdens with thy company
by allah are my lord answered i thou hast indeed iver whelmed me with thy favours and well doings but i weary for a side of my friends and family in native country
then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchants afore said
he asked me whence they came and i said to him by allah a commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way thither

presently my friends came to me in i distributed presence among my family and gave arms and largesse after which i yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment mirth and merrymaking and forgot all but i had suffered
such then are my brothers is the history of what befell me in my sixth voyage and to morrow in shar
i will tell you the story of my seventh th last voyage which is still more wondrous and marvellous than that of the first six
when it was the five hundreds sixty third night
she said at hath reached me our auspicious king that when sinbad the seaman had related the history of what befell him in his sixth the voyage and all the company had dispersed sinbad the landsman went home and slept as of want
the seventh voyage of sinbad the san
no o company that after my return from my sixth the voyage which brought me abundant profit i resumed my formal life and all possible joyance and enjoyment and mirth and making mary day and night and i tarried some time in this solace and satisfaction till my soul began once more to long to sail the seas and sea foreign countries and company with merchants and here new things
so having made up my minder packed up in bales quantity of precious stuffs suited for sea trade and repaired with them from bagdad city to baasa town where i found a ship ready f sea and in her a company of considerable merchants
but the captain arose and tighten in his girdle tucked up his skirts and after taking refuge with ol from sate and the stoned climb to the mast head whence he looked out right and left and gazing at the passengers and crew fou to buffet in his face and plucking out his beard
this he set in a saucer wetted with a little water and after waiting a short time smelt and tasted it and then he took out of the chest a booklet wherein he read awhile and said weeping no are yee passengers that in this book is a marvellous matter to notin that whoso come kid that shall surely die without hope of escape for that this ocean is called the sea of the climb of the king wherein is a sepulchre of our lord solomon son of david on both be peace
a second fish waded appearance and which we had seen nought more monstrous
when suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship which rose out of the water settled upon the great reef the haunt of sea monsters where it broke up and fell asunder into planks and all in everything on board were plunged into the sea

seven queen jugs put in petter
we feel that we must live on cream for dst of our lives
of course some of them can be changed
i put it band by the clara jab said v alfred bas with another objects
vigilance was not completely crowned with sense of victory
after they had said good night to their visitor missus pitter expressed her conviction that he had taken something
how on earth are we to know said petter the mean pig hasn't bought us a present and i'm hanged if he shall carry one off
is the only thing to do
lilford was laid in coming down to breakfast and his manner showed plainly that something was amiss
an unpleasant thing to have to say he blurted out presently but i'm afraid you must have a thief among your servants something's been taken out of my portmanteau
it was a little present for my mother and myself for your silver wedding
i should have given it last night after dinner only happened to be a cream jog and you seemed an eyed at having so many to pickets so i felt waller awards about giving
th snatcher had been an oh and this many years
lady earnest and began coat his mother moved in circles which were entirely beyond their compass or ambitions and the sun would probably one day be an ambassadors
husband and wife looked blandly and desperately at one another
it was missus peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there are thieves in the house we game the drawing room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while weir at breakfast
she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not the stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later bearing a cream jug in her hands
the pigeon coats had turned paler than ever missus peter had a final inspiration
peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lives so long during the last few minutes that a golden weddings seemed with the measurable dis
missus peter turned to her guest with confidential kindness
peter little weakness a turn seemed the family good lord
do you mean the dayes a cleft amin like cousin's natur
very little woman said bitter river gasps of relief i could never have done it
and for the car lying off the coast
don't cry he said i was obliged to come
and and you have not found out anything came in quick frightened tones
i wish you would believe me that i am in his great trouble about a as your are
that my fathers sir risdon graham as smuggled goods here
he could not help it he hate the smugglers you shall not tell
pretty pray say you will not archie was son
then as archie stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he heard the faint rustling once more and again all was simon
he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full of vexation engineer am a proper as the prince call her love of our own dignity of which archibald stroke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british officer had a pretty good stock
and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
col wooer came on this idea directly as he recalled the facts that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless sit at people who would stop at nothing
no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would knock me about
the kick he had received was a fore taste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could
to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest point and signal for help lost boat's crewe rory surging for him how to escape
but window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone sill
next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old fashioned marble mantelpiece fireplace chimney
yes if otherways failed he could escape up the chimney
no that was too bad he cannot do that
sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hose were completely gone now and he said his teeth fast and mentally called himself a week idiot for ever thinking about such people
an narrow table against the walling two places
he went and tried to force his head through recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the bother would pass
but there was no chance for his body there that had would not go first
a fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
sure you look ground everywhere boy yes father quite
i'm going on the brekfast
shall i come do feather no
stop here till sir wisdom c adown until among very sorry that we should have cleared our last night only a born fool saw jerry nan's lobster boat towing into the cove and came running to say it was a party from the cutter yes father
tall i him not to be uneasy tis all right and i'll have everything clear away to nay
the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin or archy ry stroke lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down my sleep
would a queer dream be felt to himself
and how queer from mister gira to be talking like that to andre teal the boy who helped the cook
and why did any call mister gurr father
there was an interval of thinking over this knotty questioned during which the low whistling went on
and i am long me two tell i was up i suppose
no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint missed hung like reeds of smoke
what did they say false alarm tell servants and they would clear all away to night see if anything had been left about lobster wrote
one sound of that room he could ram and by daylight the smugglers dar not hunting down
oh those bars he want to they exclaimed and he was advancing towards them when just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the windows a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of bos against stone work and rams face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young maned ship and instead
ram was the first to recover from his surprise
flow he said hurl
go round open the door i was should him last night by mistake
i saw you last night and wanted was boy he was
it was you father kicked for shirking and my well i hardly knowed you
nonsense
won't do said remembering
think i don't know you mister orficer
won't do said run quickly i know you
con clinging the spire to a h b knee f act you in
archie stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
he has gone to give the alarmed what the prisoner and he looked cited round for a way of escape
nothing but the gene presented itself
a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curve dirk glanced at the edge ran to the windows and began to cut at one of the bars labor in vain
he divided the pain and produced a few squeaks in grating sounds as he realised that the attempt was madness
the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear selling sound as he found that now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
but at the end of five minutes he stopped and fust back the durk into a sheath
no we can't part with that ha fer laughed the boy jeeringly
below yes i'll give you a guinea if he will let me out
guiney said the boy think i'll do it for guinea welled then too
be quick theres a good fellow i want to get away at once
not you only a sham
why your clothes don't fit you when your caps put on all scare
never mind about that let me out of this place
i told you a fisher boy cried arch impatiently but tying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
not you look like a wild beast in a cage make a monkey you insolent
aren't you checked himself in the boy laughed
it was your turn yesterday its mind to day what a game
you laft and cleared at me when i was on the cutter's deck
i say you do with le to lemon just th a big mogi and show
ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long low fit of laughter
you rope send me he said
why i could tie you up and a not and heave you of ll any day what a game
b of a made fed on a salt tack and mutely biscuit talk of giving me ropes and
once more will you come and let me out no
to his astonishment the board d not flinch but thrust his own arms the replacing him about the middy's waist clenching his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle

you m use this letter in your own way
i will give you this outlining sketch of my whereabouts in actions at the time of certain robberies with which i'm charged
at the time of the gallop and bank robbery i was gathering cattle and ellis county texas cattle at up bob from pleas taylor and rector
this can be proved by both of them also less er barking and fifty other respectable men of that county

about the last of december eighteen seventy three i arrived in carroll parish louisiana
i stayed there until the eighth of february eighteen seventy four
i had not heard of that when i wrote the letter of eighteen seventy four and to correct any misapprehension that might be created thout knitting it i will say that at the time i was at the ohio kansas with a drove of cattle which are sold to major ray
it was immediately following the rock alan robber at eight or iowa that their first appeared a delivered and listen of some local papers and missouri to connect us with this robbery
i arst on the boys that whatever happened we should not shear any one
but mill and i a crossed the bridge the three were all some dry good boxes at the corner near the bank and as soon as they saw us went rid into the bank instead of waiting for us to get there
when we came up i toil mill if you shot the bank door which they had left open in the hurry
jes helen who's hard were store was near try to go into the bank but miller ordered him away and you run around the corner shouting
git your guns boys their robbing the bank
and i called to him to get inside at the same time firing a pistol shout in the air as a signal to the three boys at the bridge that we had been discovered
almost at this instant i heard a pistol shot in the bank
shed well woods and jim rode up and joiners shouting to the people in the street to get inside and firing their pistols two emphasized their commands
if any of our party shot him it must have been woods
meantime the street was getting uncomfortably hot
every time i saw anyone with a bead on me i will drop off my horse and try to drive the sheet or inside but i could not see in every direction
doctor wheeler who had gone upstairs in the hotel shot miller and he lay dying in the street
changing his pistol to his left hand bob ran out and mounted miller's mayor
but gift you so long eyed pits
as to the rest of the affair inside the bank i take the account of a north feeld narrator

share of clisson of water one county who was taking bob's pistol from him was also shouting to the fellow
including those received in and on the way from north field i have eleven wounds
in chair off clisson order not to sheet was the beginning of the protector that minnesota people established over us
captain murdock
but mars port had flourished enough to kill it off
some of mar's laws dated from the time when lawn force ment had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
the stone wall gang numbered perhaps five hundreds
even dare alex and failures had to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which eat out some kind of a marginal living
they were safe from protection rack tiers there none bothered to come so far out
the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
captain murdock was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
the pressure was enough to get them for him
gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
i've got a free hand and we're going to run this the way we would on earth
your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
the first man making a shake down we'll get the same treatment were going to use on the stone well boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
he picked out five of the men including gordon you five will come with me
the rest of you can teem up any way you want tonight pick any rout the open though came in l s go
bruce gordon grin slowly as he swung the stick and murdock's eyes fell on him earth cop
two year's gordon admitted
for a second gordon cursed himself
he began wondering about security then
nobody had tried to get and touch with him
there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim fop for bulb glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
moving in two groups of threes that opposite sides of the street they began their beat
there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from whack of a
gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned to club in his hands
gordon's eyes popped it that
he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
the other four copse had come in reluctantly
he brought him to the ground with a single blow crossed the kidneys
they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cup started off
to find a pone and call the wagon
we're not using wagons murdock told him lye them up
if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were clubbed carefully
murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulder shaking in tears running down his cheeks
the captain's face was as sick as gordons felt
i want the name of every man and the gang ye can remember he told the man
colonel they kill me i don't know
murdock took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tufts
if he should turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
trouble began brewing shortly after though
murdock sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
and the third one bruce gord and spotted one of the men had been beaten before
get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he were
but the captains stirred finally sighing
now the copse they are giving me were covered gordon
but the stonewall ganges backing wane
but iss goin to be tough on them
bruce gordon grimmest i've got a yellow ticket from security
murdock blanked he dropped his eyes slowly
what makes you think wain will be re elected
nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
ever see a martian election
no youre first true he can't lose
and then hell is going to pop in this whole planet may be blown wide open
it fitted with the di of predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better foods from the fair restaurant around the corner
cost a more but they be respectable
because i he is always honest according to have he sees it
but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
the groups grew more experienced and murdock was trying a new squad every night
it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
this could lead to abuses as he'd seen on earth
but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor wain was re elected
it was night outside and the phosphates at the corners glowed dim lane giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house
it had probably been years since any had dared ris it after the sun went down
and the slow doubtful respects on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that hai system was working
gordon hit the signal switch and the mar speaker let out a shrill whistle
gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
you can't do it to me
i am reformed i am going street
you damned copse cent oi i was blubbering
one look was enough the work papers had the tell tale over thickening of the signature they had showed up on other papers obviously forgeries
some turned away as gordon and the other cop went to work but most of them warn't squeamish
when it was over the two picked up their whimpering captive
chinks the other cop had been holding the wallet
must have been making a big contact and something fifty fifty
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
when gordon and jenkins came back murdock tossed the money to them split it
whatever comes to ha governor
like this social call a gordon asked him
the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober no
you are me some bell's governor
eleven hundred fifty credits
you didn't pay up your pledged to the captain fund so i had a fill in
a thousand interests at ten per cent a week standard right
gordon had heard of the friendly interest charge on the side here but he shook his head wrong is he
hah is he turned it over and shook his head
now show me where i signed any agreement saying i'd pay you back
first second izzie's face went blank then he chuckled
he poured out the bills and handed them over
thanks is e thanks yourself
the kid pocketed the money cheerfully noding
the little guy new mars as few others did apparently from all sides
and if any of the other copse had private rackets of their own i he was undoubtedly the man to find it out and needed the information with a beat such as that even going halves and with all the graft to the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped into the bench
go on except dan it
there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
the little publisher was back at the crusader again
only gordon and sh lo were left
credit had been established again and the business were opened
gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwellings bil like the dome but opaque for privacy
they have been lucky
sil bird's volunteers were official now
fats place was still opened though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
he reached automatically for the class of ether needle beer
thought ye'd be in the chips
that's mars gord knacker other's comment why don't you pull off the planet fats you could go back to earth i'd guess the other nodded
guess a man gets used to anything hell maybe i can hires e bumps to sit around and mop it up when the ships come in and bi this is a real old martian den of sin
there was a grin on the other's face
finally got out o orders for you it's mercury
we sent fy others the same way and they failed
let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
you can't stay here
there's a rocket waiting to tranship you to the m on the way to mercury wright now gordon side
and i paid her the pay we ow you from the time he begin us in your beds she's up shopping
but his old eyes were glinting
did you think we'd let you go without seeing you off copper he asked
i i o dread it i'm getting old i he you tell him
he grabbed gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank izzie shook his head
any colchester had begun to make prince with leslie
leslie determined to trip upon u an english language and literature

leslie seated herself with her back to her companion and opened her or letters

just after midnight she rose with a sigh to prepare for beard
she looked round the room
now a remember she got a letter which upset of very much and went out
leslie win to the windows and flung it open she put her head out and tried to peer into the darkness but the moon had already said and she could not see more than a couple of yards in front of her
she is a very queer erratic creature and at litter there was bad news in their litter
what can't you've doing out by herself
this l lit the room but she had skies me gone a dozen places downed the corridor before she met any returning
any eyes were very bright her cheeks were not longer pale and there was a brilliant colour and him
she did not take the least notice of las thing but going into the room shut the door

she gott into bid as she spoke and wrapped the cloaks cutty round her

she turned off the light and letter candle which she put the hydra screen then prepared to get and beard
amy's manner was very mysterious
annie did not meet to confine th any one that night and the kindest thing was to leap her alone
tie it out lesley yourself propped asleep
annie is that you she called out
there was in reply but the sound of prying steps came quicker and quicker now and then there interrupted by a groan
