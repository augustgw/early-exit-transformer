the music came nearer and he recalled the words the words of shelley's fragment upon the moon wandering companionless pale for weariness
the dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail
a cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul
the chaos in which his ardor extinguished itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself

on saturday mornings when the sodality met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a cushioned kneeling desk at the right of the altar from which he led his wing a boys through the responses
her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity her holiness a strange light blowing faintly upon her frail flesh did not humiliate the sinner who approached her
if ever he was impelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be her night
he tried to think how it could be
but the dusk deepening in the schoolroom covered over his thoughts the bell rang
then he can ask him questions on the catechism daedalus
stephen leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler listened to the talk about him which heron checked from time to time by saying
it was strange to that he found an arid pleasure in following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own condemnation
the sentence of saint james which says that he who offends against one commandment becomes guilty of ae had seemed to him first a swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own state

why was the sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and wine if jesus christ be present body and bloods soule and divinity in the bread alone and in the wine alone
if the wine change into vinegar and a host crumble into corruption after they have been consecrated is jesus christ still present under their species as god and as man
a gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged stephen to ask a difficult question
the rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from
he clasped his hands on the desk and said
the retreat will begin on wednesday afternoon in honour of saint francis saviour whose feast day is saturday
on friday confession will be heard all the afternoon after beads
beware of making that mistake
stephen's heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower
he is called as you know the apostle of the indies
a great saint saint francis saviour
the rector paused and then shaking his clasped hands before him went on
he had the faith in him that moves mountains
a great saint saint frances saviour
in the silence their dark fire kindle the dusk into a tawny glow
he could wait no longer
for a full hour he had paced up and down waiting but he could wait no longer
he set off abruptly for the bull walking rapidly lest his father shrill whistle might call him back and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was safe

the pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused
soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding
the uncouth faces past him too by two stained yellow or read or livid by the sea and as he strove to look at them with ease and indifference a faint staine of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face
angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallows swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their top heavy silk hats and humble tape like collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes brother hickey
brother a card brother keel
their piety would be like their names like their faces like their clothes and was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts it might be paid a farr richard tribute of devotion than his had ever been a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration
it was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates stripped of his pride beaten and in beggar's weeds that they would be generous towards him loving him as themselves
idle and embittering finally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour as ourselves with the same amounts and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love

a voice from beyond the world was calling

their dining stone poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges and the rough hewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horse play gleamed with cold wett lustre

you will find me continually speaking of fore men titan whole by turner and thin cod and almost the same terms
that unite every quality and sometimes you will find me refrain to them as colorists sometimes as kyar crests
by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the circus devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing un separated light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light
my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt a copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hugh side by side

the brown ground beneath is left for the most part one touch of black as put for the hollow two delicate lines of dark gray to find the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of amanda
for believe me the fauna philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock robin is to be read and of a grass plot to be green and the best skill art is an instantly seizing on the manifold delicious ness of light which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch
now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is enclosed properly and harmonized with the other hugs it becomes somehow more precious and pearly th the white paper and that i am not afraid tol leave a whole field of uncreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds and the round window will tell as jewels if they are graded justly
but in this ving yett coffee from turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly

do not therefore think that the gothic school's easy one
the law of that schools that everything shall be seen clearly or least only in such mister faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground
this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decoratively that a represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact you are producing jeweler's work rather than pictures
that a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous
in all early gothic art indeedy you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art
the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble an ill drawn figures that is merely child as and failing work of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school
but observe you can only dose us on one condition that have striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquillity of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purest painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life

nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you mourn more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great and spirit and in matter

here's an equally typical greek school landscape by wilson lost hoy and golden mist the trees so slightly drawn that you don't know if they are trees or towers and no care for color whatsoever perfectly deceptive in marvellous effect of sunshine through the mist apollo in the python

in both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature though suffering is still dignified and beautiful
every line in which the master traces it even were seemingly negligent as lovely and set down with a meditative calmness which makes these two edgings capable of being placed beside the most tranquil work of whole vine or dure
but now here is a subject of which you will wonder at first wh turner drew it at all
it has no beauty whatsoever no specialty of picturesqueness in all its lines are cramped and poor
the cram ness in the poverty are all intended

it was his observation that true from douglas not immediately but later in the evening a reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call attention
some one else told storing up particularly effective which i saw he was not following
cried one of the women he took no notice of her he looked at me but as if instead of me he saw what he spoke of
there was a unanimous gran at this and much reproach after which in his preoccupied way he explained

he quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair
probably not all the second post
it was almost the tune of hope everybody will stay
cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed
missus griffin however expressed the need for a little one light
who was it she was in love with the story will tell i took upon myself to reply oh i can't wait to the story the story won't te said douglas not in any literal vulgar way more's the pity done
won't you tell douglas
well if i don't know who she was loveth i know who he was
let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall presently give
poor douglas before his death when it was in sight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth
the departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't of course thank heavens stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a rage of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked u up
the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tail at a point after it had in a manner a gum
he had for his own town residence of big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in essex that he wished to immediately to proceeded
the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took a all his time
they were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority
i don't an pris pate
she was young untried nervous it was a vision of serious duties and little company of really great loneliness
yes but that's just the beauty of her passion
it was the beauty of it
it's sound a dull that sounded strange and all the mor so because of his main condition which was
she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded
but was that all her rewards one of the ladies asked
how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that through its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this childs
god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely childs whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
yet these thoughts affected hester prynne less with hope than apprehension
the childs had a native grace which does not invariably co exist with faultless beauty it's attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garbed that precisely became it best
this outwards mutability indicated and did not more than fairly expressed the various properties of her inner life
hester could only account for the child's character and even then most meagrely and imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that moment is period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth
they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind
hester prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one childs ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge
as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that rolled the moment
it was look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits but hester could not have questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human childs
beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the childs to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has evoked the spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
pearl was borne outcast of the infantile world
pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance
if spoken too she would not speak again
hester pron wet one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state bor though the chances of a popular election had caused the former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy
another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
at that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter publick interests and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with a deliberations of legislators and acts of state
the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only cause a fierce and bitter contests in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the frame work itself of the legislature
we have spoken of pearls rich and luxuriant beauty a beauty that shown with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depths and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black
it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life
the mother herself as if the redd ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture
but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only and consequence of that identity had hester contrive so perfectly to represent the scar at letter in her appearance
come therefore and let us spling met at them
but pearl who was a dauntless childs after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight
she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them
it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times
they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were latticed windows the wooden shutters to close over them that need
lifting the iron ham are that hung at the portal hester prime gave the summons which was answered by one of the governor's bond servants a freeborn english man but now a seven years slave
yeah his honourable worship is within but he hath a godly minutest to with him and likewise a alle
yee may not see his worship now
with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentleman of fairest state in his native land
on the table and token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind stood a large pewter tankard at the bottom of which a hester or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draft of ale
little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering fronts piece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breast plate
mother cried she i see you here look look
and truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it
pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery
but the proprietor appeared already to have re relinquished as hopeless the aport to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening
there were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mister blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that half mythological personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a ball
pearl seeing the rose bushes began to cry for her red rose and would not be pacified
he wore blue silk stockings blue neap pants with gold bubbles a blue ruffled waist and a jacket and bright blue braided with gold
his hat had a peaked crowned the flat brim and around the brim with a row a tiny golden bells to tinkled when he moved
instead of shoes the old man war boots with turn over tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold bid
for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of oz in which they lived
when they were outside og simply lathed the door and started up the path
no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
at the foot of the mountain separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the glance the path divided
he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbour
all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unc and ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket
then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of doctor piped
uncocked at the door of the house and a chubby pleasant faced woman dressed all them blew opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile
i am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home
we have come from a fire lonely a place than this lone me your place
and you must be ojo the unlucky she added
ojo had never eaten such a fine meal and all his life
we are traveling replied ojo and we stop at your house just a resting refresh ourselves
the woman seemed thoughtful
at one end stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row all bubbling and steaming at a great rate
it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this ment i am pleased to say it is nearly done you see im making it for my goodwife margolotte who wants to you some of it for a purpose of her own
you must know said margolotte when they were all seated together on the broad windows seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mamy the witch who used to leave in the country of the kill cans to the north of here
the first lot we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since
i think the next glass cap and magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and they prove of some us to us
i am afraid i don't know much you ab the lay and device
you see i lived all my life without monkey the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything
that is one reason you are ojo the unlucky said the woman in sympathetic tone
i think i must show you my patchwork girl said marvel laughing at the boy's astonishment as she is rather difficult to explain
but first i will tell you that from many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cop the meals and wash the dishes
yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose
a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and colors of cloth all neatly so together
sometimes it is call a crazy quilt because the patches and colours are so mixed upo
when i found it i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from tying to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are
at the emerald city where our princess ozma lives green is the popular color
i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors
ojo examined this curious contrivance with wonder
margolotte had first made the girl's form from the patchwork quilted and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same gay material throughout
the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her
the hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her necking several neat braids
gold is the most common metal in the land of oz and is used from many purposes because it is soft and pliable
no i forgot on the bout and brains exclaimed the woman
well that may be true agreed margolotte but on the contrary a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work
she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles
i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in the servant
she ran to her husbands side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire
their contents said all boiled away leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder
very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it al together in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon
no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
ojo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
he selected a small gold bottle with a pepper box top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any objects through the small holes
most people talk too much so it is a relief to find one who talks too little
i not allowed to reform magic except for my own amusement he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe where the cookin stem and began to smoke
the wit of oz who used to be a humbug and knew no magic at all has been taking lessons of glinda and i told he is getting to be a pretty good wizards but he is nearly the assistant of the great sorceress
it truly is asserted the magician
i know use them as ornamental statuary in my garden
dear me one a chanter box are getting to be un remarked the magician who was pleased with the compliment
asked the voice in scornful accents

the edict of milan the great charter of toleration had confirmed to each individual of the roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion
but this inestimable privilege was soon violated with a knowledge of truth the emperor ebb the maxims of persecution and the sex which dissented from the catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of christianity
constantine easily believed that the heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation
some of the penal regulations were copied from the edith's of diocletian and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who would felt the hand of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity
they asserted with confidence and almost with exultation that the apostolical succession was interrupted that all the bishops of europe and asia were infected by the cantation of guilt in schism and that the prerogatives of the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the african believers who alone had preserved in violet the integrity of their faith and discipline

the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had dispersed the mists and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest when the travellers resumed their journey
after proceeding a few miles the progressive hawkeye who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross i rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters
distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinions of ching get goo were frequent and earnest
yet here are we within a short range of the skins and not a sign of a trail have we crossed
let us retrace our steps and examine as we go with keener eyes
ching gutch cook had caught the look and motioning with his hand he bade him speak
the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed
it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding
see said uncas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone towards the forest
if a rock or rivulet or a bit of earth harder than common severed the links of the clew they followed the true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary
extinguished brands were lying around a spring the awful of a deer were scattered about the place and the trees bore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses
a circle of a few hundred feet and circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
the examination however resulted in no discovery
the whole party crowded to the spot where uncas pointed out the impressions of a moccasin in the moist de alluvium

notwithstanding the high resolution of hawkeye he fully comprehended all the difficulties in danger he was about to incur
in his return to the camp his acute and practised intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of balum's asked to speak he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bere singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs
there was something in his air and the manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
the ingenious hawk eye who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well known voice replied
can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the truth began to dawn upon him
come come returned hawk eye un casing his honestest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companions you may see a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to ith that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business

i greatly mourned that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and i have sought a goodly him can you lead me to him
the task will not be difficult return david hesitating though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase that mitigate his unhappy fortunes
the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very center of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
for or fit the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas weary but close observers of the manner of their captive
delivered in a strong tone of ascent announced the gratification the savage would receive and witnessing such an exhibition of weakness and an enemy so long hated and so much feared
they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter
but the bare instead able ban maintain the seat it had taken and growled
the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hint he received they must stand further off
then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place
it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful wits
the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and the singer as as good as nothing
the delawares are children of the tortoise and they outstripped the deer
uncas who had already approached the door in readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
but hawkeye who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himselfe to his companion
so uncas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
well what can't be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention
as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions
my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little metal that so direct and attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgot in my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
if you are not then knocked on the head your being anon composer will protect you and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed
situ for yourself to make a rush or terry here
bravely and generously as he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service
keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practise myself as one without across a blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
god bless you friend i do believe your sent has not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of temptation
the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features is he afraid
will the herons here his groans
mohican started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort
he had though occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
unc u cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
i will endeavor in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clears something very unusual had occurred
my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
without his scrap books his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
i was absent mother more than an hour
the only du poo at which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honest is absolutely above suspicion
the moment i looked at my table i was aware that some one had rummaged among my papers
the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together
the alternate was that someone passing had observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed into cable i mad a most careful in sil of the room
a broken tip of lead was lying there also
not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it
above all things i desired to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
to the bestest of my belief they were rolled up
did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
i was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door open
so it seems to me
now misters stones that your disposal
above were three students one on each story
then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his neet craned he looked into the room
there is no opening except the one pinion said our learned guide
i am afraid there are no signs here said he
one could hardly hope for anny upon so dry a day
you left him in a chair you say which chair by the window there
the man entered and took the papers sheep by sheet from the central table
as a matter of fact he could not said sums for i entered by the side door
h long would to tak him to do that using every possible contraction in a quarter an hour not less
then he tossed it down and seized the next
he was in the midst of that when your returned caused him to make a very hurry retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
mister songs was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information
holmes held out a small ship with the letters and n and the space of clear wood after them you see
watson i have always done you and injustice there are others
i was hoping that if the paper i which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polish surface no i see nothing
as holmes drew the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and in alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
hm turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor hello what is this
homes how it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light
what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
i understand you to say that there are three studs who use this stare and are on the habit of passing your door yes there h are
and they are all in for this examination yes
one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
let us yit a suspicions i will look after the proofs
my scholar has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
the top floor belongs to miles mc c laren
i dare not go so far as that but of the three he has perhaps' the least unlikely
he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life
by have occasionally done the same thing at other times
did you look at these papers on the table
how came youre to leave the key in the door
any one in the room could get out yes sir
i really don't think he knee much about at mister holmes
only for a minute or so
o i would not venture to say sir
you haven't seen any of them no sir
it was the indian who dark silt appeared suddenly upon his blind
he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
the set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
no names please said holes as we not at gil herr store
of course he did not realize that it was i who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances roller suspicious
that is very importance said homes
you don't seem to realize in a position
to morrow was the examination
i canoun ab allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced
it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of actions
i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings c by
when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
the thou mouths fellow at the top
he is the one with the worst record
why banister a servant what's his game in the matter
he impressed me as being a perfectly honestest man
my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders and half humorous resignation
no good my dear watson
i think so you have formed a conclusion
yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery
look at that he held out his hand
on the palm were three little pyramids of black dough ye clay
and one more this morning
in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuables scholarship
he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched think heaven that you have come
you not him i think so
if this matter is not to become publicly must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court marshal
no sir certainly not
there was no man sir
his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finely rested with an expression of blank dismay upon banister in the farther corner
just close the door said holes
we want to know mister gil christ how you an honourable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday
for a moment gil christ with upraised hand tried to control his writhing features
come come said holes kindly it is human to air and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal
well well don't trouble to answer listen and see that i do you know in justice
he could examine the papers in his own office
the indian i also thought nothing of
when i approached youre room i examined the window
no unless than that would have a chance
i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table
he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided ass are weare with several sharp spikes
no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
he put his shoes on the table
gloves said the young man
suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
h i told the truth mister gil crest
i have a letter hear mister seals which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night
it will be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out
it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know
if mister som saw them the game was up
in the debate between the senior societies her defend of the fifteenth amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not a verse to charleston or new orleans
john taylor who had supported her through college was interested in cotton
better go he had counsel sententiously
might learn something useful down there
but john is no society just elementary work
ben look up tunes county
fi some crust wells there big plantations waited at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
some others too dear cotton county
you all to know john if i teach negros i'll scarcely see much of people in my own class
at any rate i say go
here she was teaching dirty childrens and a smell of confused odors and bodily perspiration was to her times unbearable
she wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies in the forms
so for the hundredth time she was thinking to day as she walked alone up the laying back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms
cotton she caused
she had almost forgotten that it was here within touch in sight
the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her stretching a white to the northward
there might be a bit of forty here and there but most of his place was such desperate prose
her regard shifted to the green stalks and leaves again and she started to move away
cotton is a wonderful thing is it not boys she said rather primly
miss taylor did that know much about cotton but at least one m remarked seemed called for
don't know will of all things inwardly commented miss taylor litter born in cotton and oh well as muche as to ask what's the use she turned again to go
i suppose though it's too early for them then can the explosion

the golden fleece it's the several fleece he hearkened
som a ayr tamer please won't you
now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even that she had been talking just talking there were no persons of the conversation just things one thing cotton
the honourable charles smith miss sarah's brother was walking swiftly uptown from mister easter le's wall steet office and his face was pale
at last the cotton combined was to all appearances in assured fact and he was slighted for the senate
why should he not be as other men
she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked at her like intelligence and others
as she awaited her guess she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and his quietude for her social functions were few to night there were she check them off on her fingers sir james ceded the rich english manufacturer and lady citing mister and missus van der boola mister harry crest well and his sister john tailor and his sister and mister charleses smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be united stat senator from new jersey a selection of guess that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of cotton interests earlier in the day
missus grey had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mind vividly their cruelty to pour negroes a subject she made her point of introducing forthwith
she was therefore most agreeably spies to hear mister caswell express himself so cordially as approving of negro education
do believe in some education asked marry taylor
i believe in the training of people to the has capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
but crest well added significantly capacity dives enormous lay between races
the banded pools were sure this and the englishman instanced india became quite eloquent missus grey was mystified but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individual's needed to be submitted to the sharper scrutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
fs it t me hick added pres well avoiding his sister's eyes
but w neither exactly welcome
mary tough however related the tale of zag to missus grey's private ear later
fortunately said mister banter fool northerners in southerners all alarming at a banter mutual understanding on most of these matters
he knew the silver fleas his and zau us must be ruined
it was the first great sorrowed his life it was not so much the loss of the cotton itself but the phantasy the hopes the dreams built round it
ahhh the swamp the cruel swamp
the revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly till it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder
he panted to know if she too knew or new and cared not who cared and knew not
she was so strange in human a creature
the world was water veiled in mists
then of a sudden at midday the sun shot out hot and still no breath of air stirred the sky was like blue steel the earth steam
where was the use of imagining
the lagoon had been level with the dikes a wee togo and now
perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly
he splashed a stepped along farther and farther onwards until he near the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
then he looked down the lagoon was dry
he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green fifth tall wet and willowy
the squares of cotton sharp edged heavy would just about to burst to bowls
a one long moment he paused stupid a gate with utter amazement van lean dizzily against a tree
he gazed a about p flexed astonished
here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work in pain someone had feather can now from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by long and cooked way thus allowing it to empty directly
he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost sola
the years of the days of her dying were ten
the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
up in the sick room o'er lay on the little white bed
the that and weave of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that stroll for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned
f while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure it son and bird and tree
she rose where the fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forwards wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
she had been borne within its porters within his boor she had lived and groan and within its border she had met her love
on she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island low the cotton lay before her
the chair was empty when he knew
he darted through the trees and posted a tall man strongly but slimy made
it is very hin old place of red brick softened by a pale powdery lichen which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables the binds and the door place
but the windows are patched with wooden pains and the door i think is like the gate it is never opened
for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shedding with a sonorous bang behind the livery lackey who had just seen his master and mist off the grounds in a carriage and pair
a large open fireplace with rusty dogs in it and a bearer boarded floor at the far end places of wolves stacked up in the middle of the floor some empty corn bags
and what through the left hand windows
several close horses a pillion a spinning wheel and an old box wide open and stuff ful of colored rags
at the edge of this box there lies a great wooden dull which so far as mutilation is concerned bears a strong resemblance to the finest greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
the history of the house is plain now
but there is always as stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beans and making sparkles among the wet straw and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cow shed and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow build ducks nore seizing the opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it as possible
were the great barn doors are thrown wide open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendents of mister guy the wid otherwise saddler who entertains them with a latest treadles and gossip
heavy sorrel often took the opportunity when her aunt's back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished services for the oak table was usually turned up like a screen and was more for ornament than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round petter dishes there were ranged on the shelves above the long deal dinner table or in the hobbs of the great which always shone like jasper
do not suppose however that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance she was a good looking woman not more than eight and thirty a fair complexion and sandy hair well shapen like footed
the v like between her and her niece dynamic with a contrast between her keenness and dinas sirrah gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a martha and mary
her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a damsel came with air shot seemed to take up an unfinished lecture as a barrel organ takes up a tune precisely at the point where it had left off
the fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the widows and why consequently missus poyser should scold molly the housemaid with unusual severity
towel appearance molly had got through her after inner work in an exemplary manner had cleaned herself with great dispatch and now came to asks submissively if she should sit down to her spinning till milking time
spinning indeed
i never knew your equals for galls ness
who taught you to scrub up floor i should like to know
come the wool for the wid os indeed
that's we she'd like to be doing is it

no no no totty a git her feet wet said missus poyser carrying away her ire
did ever anybody see the like screamed missus poyser running towards the table when her eye had fallen on the blue stream
toady however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run and in amount of fat on the neighbor per neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig
and she was very found of view two aunt rachel
i often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way
which y had that ban illness and i was only eleven year's old she used to say you'll have a friend on earth in your aunt rachel if i'm taken from you for she has a kind heart and i'm sure i've found it so
and there's linen in the house as i could wells spare you for i got lots a sheeting and table clothing in twins isn't made up
did not more than what's in the bible and said dinna
nay dear aunt you never heard me say that all people are call to forsake their work in her families
we can all be servants of god wherever our lot is cast but he gives us different sorts of work according as he fits us for it and calls us to it
i can no more helps spending my life in trying to do what i can for the souls of others then you could help running if you heard little totty crying at the other end of the house the voice would go to your heart you would think the dear childs in trouble or in danger and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort her
i've strong assurance that no evil will happen you and my uncle and the children for from anything i've done
i didn't preach without direction
direction
i had a common patience with you
by this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and had got down from their horses it was plain they meant to come in
said mister berwin with this stately cordiality
oh ser don't mention it said missus poyser
i delight in your kitchen
poison is not at home missie
said captain done horn sitting himselfe where he could see along the short passage to the open darr door
no sir he isn't he's gone to rossiter to see mister west the factor about the wool
but there's father and barn sir if he'd be of any use
no thank you i'll just look at the whelps and leave a message about them with your shepherd
i must come another day and see your husband i want you to have a consultation with him about horses
for if is anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute
oh sir said missus poyser rather alarmed you wouldn't like it at all
but you know more about that than i do sir
i think i should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place
i knows farm is in better order than any other within ten miles of us and as for the kitchen he added smiling i don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it
by the by i've never see your dairy it must seer daring missus poyser
this missus poyser said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her mote pans and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy
oh i've no doubt it's in capital order
the paris planned like that of the crystal palace was a temporary exhibit
the london plant was last temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings and the vicinity of whole barn ba
there mess y's johnson and hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told
the dynamo electric machine though small was robust for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine seventeen years
owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current
why if we erect station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city
there seems no good reasoned for believing that it will change
broad as the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them he is idiocy chronically opposed to loose and wasteful methods to plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate
everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against its seriously
it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could a charge stage batteries all of which are easily with am ability of the direct current
but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a farm mouse the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and his ideal
edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy and nothing would satisfy him that couldn stand cross examination by microscope test tube and galvanometer
unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governed regulated than those available for his dynamo and lamp edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give us steady light
mister edison was a leader far had of the time
he obtained the desired speeded and lowe with a friction break also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator to verify it
then again there was no known way to lubricate and engine for continuous running and madison in formed me that as a renee engine started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so in engine for his purposes must produce light at all times
edison had install his his start first great central station system in new york on the multi able arc system covered by his feeder and maine invention which resulted in unable saving in the cost of conductors as against a strait two wire system throughout of the tree kind
he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact district of large cities
the strong position held by the edison system under this strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate epic to incandescent lighting
it was specially suited for a trial plat also in the early days when a yielded six or eight lamps to the horse bower was consider subject for congratulation
the street conductors were of the overhead whole line construction and were in stalled by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build an equip central stations
meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wi system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent in bents at practically the same time
i think he was perhaps more appreciative than i was of the discipline of the edison construction to pardon and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning the fourth before we started up
but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country
they were later used as reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of eis sonia but they remained i practically as good condition as one installed in eighteen eighty three
the ark lamp in stalled outside a customers premises or in a circuit for publick street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many knights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident
edison held that the electricity sold must be measure just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter
there was infinite skepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject bere thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or wade and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact pointed use could not be brought to accurate registration
hence the edison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
the principle employed in the edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance
associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit aft of current or damage
the standard edison mither practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company's another set being substituted
in december eighteen eighty ape mister de j jenks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other
the others having been in operation to short at time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis
in this connection it should be mentioned that the associations of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison meter was accurate and at its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station sum and current by meter
the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nin and probably up to the close of the century
he weighed and re wade the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
the problem was salt
we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part
we had neither is in which there were two bottles of liquid
here she would stay comforted en soothed among the lovely plants and rig exotics rejoicing the heart of old turn at a gardener who since polly's first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous ams of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
then dear said missus whitney you must be kind to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear at no longer
if she could only see phronsie for just one moment
oh she's always at the piano said man she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
at this the bundle open suddenly and out popped phronsie
but polly couldn't speak and of jasper hadn't caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool phronsie and all
asked phronsie with her little face close to polly's own
now you'll stay cried man say polly mote you
oh you are the dearest and best mister king i ever saw but how did you make mammy let are come
isn't he splendid cried jasper an intense pride swelling up father knew how to do it
there there he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head
i know gasped polly controlling her sobs i won't only i can't think you
asked phronsie in intense interest slipping down of polly's arms and crowding up close to jasper side
yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he didn now truly phronsie
oh no japs sor i must go by my very own self
bear jap you've caught it laughed percy while the others screamed the side of jasper's face
don't mind it polly whisper jasper twasn't her fault
dear me ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost amazement and such a time as i've had to get her here too
how did her mother ever let her go
she asked impulsively i didn't believe you could persuade her father
i didn't have any fears if i worked to rightly said the old gentleman complacently
he cried in high dudgeon just as if he owned the hole of the peppers and could dispose at them all to suit his fancy
and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space at time
at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously
it is sixteen years since john berks and died
his wife now lies beside him and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields
from the norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checker board marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light
from the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gaily painted farmhouses the gilded weather veins on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
the heir and the earth are are curiously mad it and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other
he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow
that's not much of a job for an athlete here i've been to town and back

indeedy he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it
they think your proud because you've been away to school or something
there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual grimness and care for detail
on either side of the road for a mile before he reached the foot of the hill stood tall o sage oran hedges their glossy green mocking off the yellow fields
any one thereabout would have told you that this was one of her richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra burgs in
there is even a white throw of bee hives and the orchard under the walnut trees

a brisk wind had come up and was driving puppy white clouds across the sky
the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
that invitation decided her
oh but i'm glad to get this place mode
just smell the wild roses they are always so spicy after a rain
we never had so many of them men here before
i suppose it's the wet season will you have to cut them too
i suppose that's the light decent two of them
it exciting to see everything growing till fast and to get the grass god
aren't you splashed look at the spider lips all over the grass
in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pale and he began to swinging his sigh with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learn
lari picked cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering ranch after another shivering when she thought a shower of raindrops on her neck and hair
an amyl mode his way slowly down toward the jerry trees
that summer the reins had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than chivato and his man could do to keep up with the core the orchard was a neglected wilderness
i don't know all of them but i know bind nance are
if i feel that way i feel that way
he reached up among the branches and began to pick with sweet insipid fruit long ivory colored berries tipped with maine pink like white coral that fall to the brown unheeded all summer through
he dropped a handful into her lap
yes don't v
oh ever so much only you seems kind of stay at and school teacher
when she used to tell me about him but always wondered whether she wasn't come little l love with him
it would serve you all right if she walked dot with karl
i life to talked to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there
oh amyl
surely you are not thinking of going off there
mary's face fou under his brooding gaze
i'm sure i but send your hope you will stay on here she murmured
i don't let stand around them look on
i want to be doing something on my own account
sometimes i don't want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the four corners of the divide together he threw out his arms and brought it bat with a jerk so like good tablecloth
i get tired of seeing man and horses going up and down up and down
i wish she weren't so restless and didn't get so worked up over things she said sadly
thank you he returned shortly
and you never used to be crossed me
i can't play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly that's what you miss marie
but amal if i understand then are good times are over we can never do nice things together any more
and anyhow there is nothing to understand
that won last it will go away and things will be just as they us too
i pray for you but that's not the same as if you pray yourself
i can't pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i won't pray not have them not if i damned for it
then all our good dimes far over
saturday august fifteenth the sea and broken all round no land in sight
the horizon seems extremely distant
all my danger and sufferings or needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am well his nature has resumed its sway
you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye axes
one might be would less reason than now
i am not com plaining that the rate is slow but that the seat is so wide
we are is in time and the fact is i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon pon on a raft
he called to sea o upon and i long v wage taking a little sail
therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects
i take this is my answer and i leave the professor d bite his lips with impatience
sunday august sixteenth
nothing new whether unchanged the wind freshens
but there seemed no reason of fear
the shadow of the wrath was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
truly the sea is of infinite width
it must be as wide as the mediterranean or they atlantic and why night
these thoughts agitated me all day and my imagination scarcely calm down after several hour sleeve
i shudder as i recall these monsters to my remembrance
i saw a de hamburg knees in the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length
i suppose professor leaden brock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pick his eyes travers the ocean from side to side
tuesday august eighteen
daring his watch i slept
two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me
the raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms
there's a wail aware cried the professor
fight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they weeded around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of expressed rates
two monster's only re creating all this commotion and be for my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world
i could distinguish the eye of ida sic glowing like a bad hot co and as large as a man's head
its jaw is enormous and according naturalists it is ard with no less than one hundreds and eighty two teeth
those huge creatures attack each other with the greatest animosity
suddenly the idiotic and the plus source disappear below leaving war pool eddy in the water
as for the if the assures as he returned to submarine cavern
the wings become lost in the distance
the weather if we may use the tern will change before law
the atmosphere is charged with vapors pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of sailing waters
the electric light can scarcely penetrate to the dense curtain which is dropped over the theater on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged
the air is heavy the sea is calm
from time time a fleecy tuft of mists would yet some gleaming light left upon it drums down upon the dense floor of grey and loses itself in the opake an impenetrable mass
the atmosphere as evidently charged and surcharged with electricity
the wind never lulls but to acquire increase strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms
there's a heavy storm coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon
those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea
on the mast already i see the light play of lammed saint ivo's fire the outstrip sill catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lad
but if we have now cease to advance why do weet leave that sail loose which at the first shock of a tempest may capsize us in a moment
that will be the safest no no never
the piled up vapours contents in the water and the air put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mist rouses itself into a world when
hon stairs night
from the under surface of the clouds there are continual missions of lurid light electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules the gashes elements of the air ne to be slaked with moisture for innumerable columns of water rushed upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam
i referred to the thermometer it indicates the figure is obliterated
is the atmosphere conditioning having once reached density to become final
the raft bears ar still to the south east
at noons the valence of the storm redoubled
each of us is lashed to some part of the raft
the waves rise above our heads
they send to be we are lost but i am not sure
a nods his consent
the farre ball half of it wide half user blue and the size of attent inch shill moved soul it about the raft but revolving on its own axis for astonishing velocity as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind
here comes there it glides now it is up the ragged stump of the mast that's it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just skimmed the powder magazine horrible
we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches hans who fixes his blue eye upon its steadily it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoided
a suffocating smell of nin tat had fills the air it enters the throat it fills the lungs
we suffer stifling pains
and how odd the directions will look
poor alice
it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed the pair white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan and the other he can trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess
oh won't she be savage if i've kept her waiting
alice to up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is today
and yesterday thinks went on just as usual
i wer if i've been changed in the night
i almost think i can remember feeling a little different
i'll try if i know all the things i used to know
i shall never get to twenty at that rate
how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws
no i've made it my mind about it if i'm mabel i'll stay down here
it'll be no use there' putting their heads down and saying come up again dear
i'm so very tired of being all alone here
an i declare it's too bad that it is
i wish i hadn't cried so much said alice as she swim about trying to find her way out
i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears
that will be a queer thing for to beast sure
i am very tired to swimming about here oh mouse
cried alice again for this time the mouth was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
we won't talk about her any more if he'd rather not we indeedy
we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
the condition is that i will be permitted to make lute or talk american stream on him so to speak because you'll never get people whether in or outside the luther in church actually to read luther unless we make him talk as he would talk to day to americans
let us begin with that his commentary undulations
the undertaking which seems so attractive when viewed as a literary tasks proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive
it was written and latin
the word had to be convinced
a word should now be said about the origin of luther's commentary and relations
much later when a friend of his was preparing addition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine m delians for instance and
in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther addressed distance and the course of gallian and rara prepared the manuscript for the printer
it presents like no other of luther's writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christ's merits alone
but the essence of luther's lectures is there
the lord has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do luke two
the word of our god shall stand forever
in every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint paul
they said to the glens you have no right to think highly of paul
he was the last to turn to christ
pawing waiter in his beneath us
indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
do you suppose that god for the sake of a few lutheran heretics would this own his entire church
against these boasting false apostles paul boldly defend his apostolic authority and ministry
as the ambassador of a government is honoured for his office and not for his private person so the minister of cries should exalt his office in order to gain authority among m
paul takes pride in his ministry not to his own phrase but to the praise of god
paul and apostle not of men et cetera
either he calls ministers though the agency of men or he cuss them directly as he called the prophets in apostles
paul declares that the false apostles were call their scent neither by men nor by man
the most they could claim as that there were sent by others
he mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by god
the call is not to be taken lightly
for person the possess knowledge is not enough
is spoils one's best work
when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his coal
i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
i knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because were taught so pry instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
this is no sinful pride it is holy pride
in god the father who raised him from the dead
the clawing superfluous on first sight
these perverse of the rightness of christ resists the father and the sun and the works of them both
in this whole epistle pul treats of the resurrection of christ
by his resurrection christ w the victory over law sin flesh world devil death hell and every evil
first two
and all the brethren which are with me
this should go far and shutting the mouths of the fal poses
although the brethren with me near not apostles like myself yet they all of one mind with me think right and teach as i do
they do not go with the enemies of the gospel predominate they over the christians are
why do they not invade the catholic provinces and preached their doctrine to godless princes bishops and doctors as we have done by the help of god
we look for that rewards which i hath not seen nor ear heard neither hat entered into the heart of man
not all the glens had become perverted
these means cannot be contaminate
they remained divine regardless of mens opinion
wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church even though ante chris rings there
so much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the apostle verse three
grace be too you in peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
the terms of grace and peace are common terns with paul and are now pretty well understood
the greeting of the apostle is refreshing
grace involves the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
the world brands this a pernicious doctrine
experience profess
however the grace and piece of god will
men should not speculate about the nature of god
was it not enough to say from god the father
to do so as to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure into comprehend his infinite majesty
he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him
embrace him and forget about the nature of god
did not christ himself say i am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
when you argue about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like
we are to hear christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher
at sin time paul confirms are creaked that christ is very god
that christ is very god is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to this spens grace and peace
to bestow peace and grace lies in the province of god who alone c create these blessings the angels cannot
otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and peace from our lord jesus christ
the arians took cries for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth
mohammed also speedily of christ
pauli to est
he never los his sight of the purpose of his epistle
not gold or silver or pascal lambs or in angel but himself what for
not for a crown or a kingdom or a goodness before sins
under score these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences
how may we obtain remission of our sins
poysers the man who is named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our sinse
since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason but they cannot be put away by our own efforts
this sentence also to finds our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single soon
the greatness of the ransom christ son of god indicates this
the vicious character of sin is brought out by the word who gave himself for our sins
but we are careless we make light of sin
we think that by some little work or marit we can dismissed
this passage then there is out the fact that all man or soldier sin
this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conceptions that sin as a small matter easily tak him care of by good works but we must present ourselves e to god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before may feel that christ was given for our sense
this attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
on the other hand we are not to regard them is so terrible that we must despair
he passes abruptly from persons the ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to men from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subjects and object first and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flats of sense
the influence which the teas has exercised upon p sterry is due hart lure misunderstanding
in this supposed depths of this dial of the meal platonists found hidden meanings in connexions with the jewish and christian skaters and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with this sperit of plato
they were absorbed in his theology and where other the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly corrector sicken him his effort realize in connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
there iss danger of the modern commentators of it tobe s falling unto the absurdities of the neo plat mists
in the present day we are well a weir that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
the fancy of the neal platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit of phase of the human mind which reviled widely in the first centuries of the christian ea and is not wholly extinct in our own day
but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spit they are opposed to him
we do not know how plata would have arranged his u dialogs or whether de thought of arranging any of them besides the te tilities which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
the dialogs is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this tour the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
but he has not as yet be find this intermediate territory which like somewhere between medicine in mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great and impiety in winking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
with rates he acknowledges the perpetual flux like an eager he asser the predominance of mine although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing by the fifi ins he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
many if not all the elements of the priest socratic philosophy are included in the timaeus
it is probable that the relation of the ideas of god were of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animal s birds fishes
the style and plan of the tus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogs
but plato has not the same messy over his instrument which he exhibits in the features or supposing
nothing can exceed the beauty or art of introduction in which his using words after his accustomed manner
but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
he could writ in one's style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet in fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the tenor of plato which characterizes to philosophical poor of lucretius
there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs and plato is earlier writings
plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work art

bet already at pointed economic evolution far eating the emergence of the lady specialized consumption of a goods as an in evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a mor oral less elaborate system
the utility of consumption as in evidence of wealth is to be classed as a dervish of growth
such consumption h for to the women is nearly incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labour and not the conception erected to their own comfort and full ass of life
with a further advance and counter this t be may changed into simple custom of a mor or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be at a bu or larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisured class
under the tabu certain victuals and mop pic clearly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior cass
crankiness and the other pathological consequences of the free yews of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become unorthodox of the superior staters of those who are able to afford the indulgence
it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a conception directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the muster
with many qualifications it more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradual awakened the general rue is fell to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their mass
the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's stresses and household paraphernalia is an up thei exception to this rue but it will appear in the sequel that this exceptions is much more obvious and substantial
the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of con mi alloy and religion these monies are also present in the later development that they not countin it to be the sol motus
there is a moralist elaborate system of rank and grates
this differentiation is further by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are the same time les of substance in their own right so that some of them must scar let all others only partially to be rated as my carries consumers
so many of them however h make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as thy curious consumer without qualification
many of these again and also many of the others or price of lest degree having turn attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive group of by carr is consume in the persons of their wife's and children their servants retainers etc cetera
the wearing of uniforms a liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even b said to be a mark of servitude real or o sensible
the wearers of uniforms in liberates may be rat divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble
that the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked
so those of this is which are by wight the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the car of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be class as ostensibly predatory employments
whenever as in these cases the menial serves in question has to directly with a primly leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires are effected horrific characters
the livery becomes obnoxious to mean the old who are required to wear it
in a general way though not whole in all consistently these two groups callin sight
the dependant who u first delegate for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in later developed of the institution when the member of persons by whom these dues are customarily performed gradual narrows the wife remains the last
but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the jutes of o carr leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone
in the communities of the weston culture this point is a present found among the lower mid of class
if beauty comfort is achieved and it is mor less for chute is circumstance a fair they must be achieved by means and methods that comme themselves to the great economic law of voiced effort
the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeedy commonly does that with a still lower dissent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slams the man and presently also the children virtually ceased to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sol exponent of the households pecuniary decency
very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decencies put away
there is no class and no country that as yielded so object before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual neet
a questionest which of the two methods were most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desire to effect
each will therefore serve about equally well ding the earner stated of social growth
the modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line
it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
it is also noticeable that the sorts c ability consumptions a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individually widest and the mobility of the populations is greatest
consumptions becomes large element in the standard of living in the city u in the country
among the country population its places to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighbor gossip sufficiently d serve the life general purpose of pecuniary repute
the result is a great nobility of the labor employed in printing paps greater than in any other equally well define in considerable body of workmen
under the simple pestle effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary elation pretty evenly between them at the outset
but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came to all the rank farram above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the coarse i peaceful culture
are the circumstance permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and almost ever is of human news
o reconciliation between the two convicting were quiets is affected by resort to make believe man an intricate polite o servants as and social duties a ceremonial nature are developed many organization s founded with some specious object of emil ration and boded in their official stent ty flees there is much coming in going and a deal of talk to the end that the talk is may not t occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic
the silent features of these development of domestic services have al it been indicated
throughout the entire revolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or of services or human life rents the obvious invocation that in order to effectually men the consume is good thing it must be expenditure of superfluities
as use in a speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation
the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends salt by consumer under this cannon of conic waste
but it is another grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterize are wasteful
in strict accuracy nothing should be flooded under the head of conspicuous waste at such expenditure as incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
and ar to c lady useful and wasteful both and it ceti to consumer mad be made up of us and waste in the most varying proportions

but anne had begun to sore just before the holidays and charlotte watch over her younger sisters with the jealous vigilance of some wild creature n had changes her very nature if danger threatens her younger
stung by anxiety for this little sister she upbraided missie for her fancied indifference to and state of health
still her heart had received a shock in the perception of anne's delicacy all these holiday she watched over her with the longing fawn anxiety which is so full of sudden pangs of fear
i doubt whether branwell was maintaining himself at this time
to celebrate the arrival of her son sylvia gave a splendid supper to which she had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance
without saying it positively she made me understand that being herself and illustrious member of the republic of letters she was well aware that she was speaking to an insect
in water to please her i spoke to her of the abbey canty and i had occasion to quote till lines of that profound writer
madame corrected me with a patronising air for my pronunciation of the word scoff which means divided saying that it ought to be pronounced secure and she added that i ought to be very glad to have learned so much on the first day of my arrival in paris telling me that it would be an important day in my life
her face was an enigma fort inspired everyone with the warmest sympathy and yet if you examined it attentively there was not one beautiful feature she could not be call handsome but no one could have thought her ugly
sylvia was the adoration of france and her talent was the real support of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her especially of the plays of marya v for without her his comedies would never have gone to posterity
so they did not think that her good conduct was a merit for she knew that she was virtuous only because herself love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority towards her theatrical sisters al though satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue
two years before her death i saw her performed the character of marianne in the comedy of mariae and in spite of her age and declining health the allusion was complete
she was honorably buried in the church of saints saver without the slightest opposition from the venerable priest who far from sharing the anti christian and tool rancey of the clergy in general said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good christian and that the earth was a common mother of all human beings as jesus christ had been the saviour of all mankind
you will forgive me dear reader if i have made to attend the funeral old sylvia ten years before her death believe me i have no intention of performing miracle you may consul yourself with the idea that i shall spare you that unpleasant tasks when poor sylvia dies
i never had any fambly
i had a name i believe in my younger days but i have forgotten it since i have been in service
i shall call you a spree
you to me a great honor
here go and g me chain tilly i have it sir
actual sic sir
madame whence some besides can answer your inquiries
i see a quantity of chairs for hire at the rate of one sou men reading the newspaper under the shade of the trees girls and men breakfasting either alone more in company waiters who were rapidly going up and down in narrow staircase hidden and the foliage
i sit down in a small table a waiter comes immediately to inquire my wishes
i to him to give me some coffee if it is good
then turning towards me he says that i looked like a foreigner and when i say that i am an italian he begins to speak to me of the cord to the city of the theaters and at last he offers to accompany me everywhere
i think him and take my leave
i address him an italian and he answers very wittily but his way of speaking weekes me smile and i tell him why
my remark pleases him but i soon proved to him that it is not the ride way to speak however perfect may have been the language of that ancient try her
i see a crowd in one corner of the garden everybody's standing still looking up
is there not a meridian everywhere
yes but the meridian of the palais royal is the most exact
that is true bad built gree
all these honestest persons are waiting their turn to get their snuff boxes filled
it is sold everywhere but for the last three weeks nobody will use any snuff but that sold at the eve cat
is it better than anywhere else
but how did she managed to render it so fashionable
simply by stopping her carriage two or three times before the shop to have her s nough box filled and by saying aloud to the young girl who handed bag the box that hur snuff was the very best in paris
you are now in the only country in the world where wit can make a fortune by selling either a genuine or a false article in the first case it receives the well go of intelligent and talented people and in the second fools are always ready to reward it for silliness is truly a characteristic of the people here and however wonderful it may appear silliness is the daughter of wit
let a man run and everybody will run after him the crowd will not stop unless the man is proved to be mad but to prove it is indeedy difficult tasks because we have a crowd of men who mad from their birth are still considered wise
it seems to me i replied that such approval such ratification of the opinions expressed by the king the princes of the blood et cetera is rather re prop of the affection fell for them by the nation for the french carried that affection to such an extent that they believe them infallible
when the king comes to paris everybody calls out thee the long hoy
she introduced me to all her guests and gave me some particulars respecting everyone of them
what sutter i said to him and my fortunate enough to see you
he himself resided the same passage and french and politely pointed out the parts in which he thoughted that i had improved on the original
for the first day sir i think that what you have done gives great hopes of you and without any doubt you will make rapid progress
i believe it sir and that is what i fear therefore the principal object of my visit here is to devotee myself entirely to the study of the french language
i am a very unpleasant pupil always asking questions curious troublesome insatiable and even supposing that i couldn't meet with the teacher ire require i am afraid i'm not rich enough to bay him

he had a good appetite cartel a good story without laughing was celebrated for his witty re barts in his sociable manners but he spent his life at home seldom going out and seeing hardly anyone because he always had a pipe in his mouth and was surrounded by at least twenty cats with which he would amuse himself all day
his housekeeper had the management of everything she never allowed him to be in needed of anything and she gave no account of his money which she kept altogether because he never asked her to render any accounts
on the sixth of april eighteen thirty the church of jesus christ of latter day saints was formerly organized and thus took on a legal existence
its origin was small a germ an insignificant seeded hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition
in set of but six regularly affiliated members and at most two score of adherents the organization numbers to day many hundred thousand souls
in place have the single hamlet in the smallest corner of which the members could have congregated there now are about seventy stakes of zion and about seven hundred organized words each ward and stake with its full compliment of officers and priested organizations
the practice of gathering its proselytes into one place prevents the bulling up and strengthening of foreign branches and inasmuch as extensive in strong organizations are seldom met with abroad very erroneous ideas exists concerning the strength of the church
nevertheless the mustered seat amongst the smallest of all seats has attained their proportions of a tree and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches the acorn is now in oak offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way fort trot
their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sun not merely that the word of prose lighting should be carried on the west but the headquarters of the church should be there established
the book woman had taught the people the true origin and destiny of the american indians and to warn this dark skinned remnant of a once mighty people the missionaries of mormonism early turned their eyes and with their eyes went their hearts in their hopes
it is notable that the indian tribes have gary regarded their religion of the latter day stint with favour seeing in the bookworm and striking agreement with their own traditions
the first well establishes seat of the church was in the pretty little town of curt land ohio almost within sight of like erie in hear soon rose the first temple of modern times
to the fervent latter a saint a temple is not simply a church building a house fur religious assembly
soon thousands of converts had rented or purchased homes in missouri independence jackson county being their center but from the first they were unpopular among the missions
the lieutenant governor lilburn w bogs afterward governor was a pronounced warm and hater and throughout the period of the troubles he man has his sympathy with the persecutors
their sufferings have never yet in fly chronicle by human scribe
making their way across the river those of the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of clay county and afterward established themselves in called well county they in founding the city of far west
a small settlement had been founded by mormon families uns shoal creek and here on the thirties of october eighteen thirty eight accompany of two hundred and forty fell upon the hapless settlers and butcher a score
beat said to the honor of some of the officers intrusted with a terrible commission that when they learn its true significance they resign their authority rather than have anything to do with what they designated a cold blooded butchery
oh what are record to read what a picture to gaze upon how awful the fact
american schoolboys read with emotions of horror of the albigenses driven beaten and killed with a pele legate directing the butchery and never oo hunted and hounded like beasts as the effect of a royal decree and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate
who began the quarrel was at the mors
as the table of the press comments against of the brutality of the missouri i quote a paragraph from the quincy argus march sixteenth eighteen thirty nine
it will be observed that an organized mob aided by many of the civil and military officers of missouri with governor bogs at their head have been the prominent actors in this business incited too it appears against the mormons by political hatred and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge
the army sound the people in poverty and left them in comparative wealth
but a word further concerning the expedition in general
it was through floats advice that be canon order the military expedition to utah ostensibly to instal certain federal officials and too repress ane alleged infanta rebellion which in fact had never come into existence but in reality to further the entreats of the secessions
moreover had the people been inclined to rebellion while greater opportunity could they have wished
already a north in the south were talked dove why not set a pos west
they knew no north do south though east no west they stood positively by the constitution and we have nothing to do in the bloody strife between brothers unless indeed they were summoned by the authority to which they had already once loyally responded to furnish men and arms for the country's need
what the latter a says call celestial marriage his characteristic of the church and is in very general practice but of celestial marriage plurality of wives was an incident never an essential
may believe in a literal resurrection and an actual hereafter aw future state shall be recognized every sanctified of authorized relation ship existing here on ear of parrot and childs brother and sister husband and wife
it has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands to observe the customs and studied the habits of more nations than one and i have yet to find the place and mead the people wherein with whom the purity of man and woman is held more precious than among the min mormons in a mountain valleys of the west
at the inception of borough marriage among the latter a saints there was no law national hor state against its practice
in eighteen sixty two a law was enacted with a purpose of suppressing coral marriage and as i been predicted in the national senate prayer to its passage it lay from many years a dead letter
federal judges and united states attorneys and utah who were not war mons nor lovers of warmer them refuse to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law because of its manifest injustice and inadequacy
this meant that f an a lunch misdemeanor for which congress prescribed a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment in a fine of three hundred dollars a man might be imprison for life i for many terms of ams natural life did the quartz power to enforce its sentences extends so far and might be fin millions of dollars
before this travesty on the administration of law could be bought before the court of last resort and there met with the reversal and rebuke it deserved then were imprisoned under sentence of many year's duration
the people confessed these measures one by one in the courts presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject an urging unconstitutional toity of the measure
then the church was disan crop rated and its property both real and personal confiscated and vied to the government of the united states and although that personal property was soon restored realestate of great value long lay in the hands of the courts receiver and the moran church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property
and so the story of mormonism runs on its finally has not yet been written the current pressed presents continuously new stages of its progress new developments of its plan
main homelike alexander because he was an engineer
he had preconceived idear about everything and his idea about americans was that they should be engineers of mechanics
it's tremendously well p on too
it's been on only two weeks and i've been half a dozen times already

i say said harry the little girls going famously to night isn't she
you know i thought the dance a bit conscious to night for the first time
west man and i will back after the first at and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself
a little attack of nerves possibly
he was beginning to feel keen interest in the slender be foot donkey girl who slipped head and out of the play singing like some one winding who with hey field
one night when h winnifred was sitting together on the bridge he told her the things had happened while he was studying abroad but he was sorry for one thing in particular and he asked her whether she thought she ought to know about them
she considered for over to mens it no i think not though wh i am glad you ask me
after that it was easy to forgot actually to forget
of course he reflected j ali had that combination of something homely insensible and something utterly wild and daft
she must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to
i'm glad she's held her own since
after all we were awfully on
i shouldn't wonder if she could laugh about it would now
hilda was very nice to him and he sat on the edge of his chair flushed with his conversational efforts and roving his chin about nervously over his high collar
they asked him to come to see them and chelsey and they spoke very tenderly of hilda
lamb wouldn't care a great deal about many of them i fancy
when bartle arrived at it bedford square on sunday evening bear the pretty little french girl met him at the door and conducted him upstairs
i should never have asked youth molly had been here for i remember you don't like english cookery
i haven't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place i think this is
they are all sketches mead about the villages day you see
those fellows are all very loyal even maine hall
i've managed to save something every year and that with helping my three sisters now and then and tiding poor cousin mike over bad seasons
it's not particularly rare she said but son of it was my mother's
there was water criss soup and soul and a delightful omelet stuff with mushrooms and truffles and two small rare ducklings and art a chops and a dry yellow roan wine of which bartle had always been very fond
there's nothing else that looked so jolly
thank you but i don't like it so well as this
have you been in paris much these lay ears
there are few changes in the old quarter
don't e i though i'm so sorry to hear it how did your son turn out
her hair is still like flax and her blue eyes are just like a babies and she has the same three freckles on her little nose and talks about going back to her bandon mare
how jolly it was being young hilda
do you remember that first walk we took together in paris
come we'll have our coffee in the other room and you can smoke
i think we did' she answered de merely
what she wanted from us was neither are flowers nor our franks but just our youth
they will both remember in what the woman had said when she took the money go give you a happy love
the strange woman and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply had frightened them both
barley started when held the rang a little bell beside her dear me why did you do that
it was very jolly he murmured lazily as marie came and to take away the coffee
have i told you about my new play
when she finished alexander shook himself out of a reverie
nonsense of course i can't really singing except away my mother and grandmother did before me
it's really to warm in this room to saying don't you feel it
alexander went over and open the window for her
they just in fronts
he stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said it' soft and misty see how wite the stars are
for a long time either hild the nor bartle spoke
he felt a tremour run through a slender yellow figure in front of him
bart le leaned over her shoulder without touching her and whispered in her ear you aren't giving me a chance yes
alexander clenched the two hands at his sides
the stop at queen's town the tedious passage of the mercy were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience
she blushed and smiled and followed his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs
alexander paced up and down the hallway buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat until she returned and took him up to hild his living room
the rooms empty way entered
alexander did not sit down
i felt it in my bones when i woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up
ive thought it might be sisters kater cousin mike would be happening along
she pushed him toward the big chair by the fire and sat down on the stool at the opposite side of the hearth her knees drawn up to her chin laughing like a happy little girl
what did you come partly and how did it happened you haven't spoken a word
i got in about ten minutes ago
alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze
bartle bent lowered over the fire
she looked at his heavy shoulders and beg determined head thrust forward like a cat pold in leash
i'll do anything you wish me too bartle she said tremulously
i can't stand seeing you miserable
he pulled up a windows if the air were heavy
hill to watched him from the corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes it
but it's worse now it's unbearable
i get nothing but misery out of either
the world is all there just as it used to be but i can't get add it any more
it was myself i was defying hilda
held this face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been
but why didn't you tell me when you were here in the summer
alexander grounded i meant to but somehow i couldn't
she pressed his hand gently ingratitude
were't you happy men at all
she closed her eyes and took a deep breath as if to drawing again the fragrance of those days
he moved uneasily and his chair creak
yes yes she hurried pulling her ha gently away from him
please tell me one thing bartle at least tell me that you believe i thought i was making you happy
yes held i know that he said simply
i understand bartle i was wrong
but i didn't know you've only to tell me now
what i mean is that i want you to promise never to see me again no matter how often i calm no matter how hard i beg
keep away if you wish when have i ever followed you
alexander rose and shook himself angrily yes i know im cowardly
he took roughly in his arms do know what i mean
h partly what am i to do
i will ask the least imaginable but i must have something
i must know aboute you
the sight of you bartle to see you living and happy and successful can i never make you understand what that means to me
you see loving some one as i love you makes the whole world different
and then you came back not caring very much but it made no difference
bartle bent over and took her in his arms kissing her mouth and her wet tired eyes
don't cry don't cry he whispered
we tortured each other enough for to night
chapter one origin
it engenders a whole world lob peg for which red theft and a hell law p grin for which red hunger
thus idle misses the mother
she has a son theft in a daughter hunger
what is slinging
we have never understood this sort of objections
slang is odious
slang makes one shudder
who denies that of course it does
when it is a question of probing a wound a gulf a society since when has it been considered wrong to go too far to go to the bottom
we have always thought that it was sometimes a creates act and at least a simple in useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted in fulfilled merits
why should w not ex score everything and study everything
wh should one halt on the way
nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang
now when has horror ever excluded study
since when has malady banished medicine
can b imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper the bad the scorpion the centipede the tana and one who would cast them back into their darkness saying o how ugly that is
he would be like a philologists refusing to examine a fact in language if philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity
what is slang properly speaking
it is the language of redness
we may be stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms which is one way of attenuating it we may be told that al trades professions it may be added all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence have their own slight
the painter who says my grinder the notary who says my skip of the gutter the hair dresser who says m merely back the cobbler who says my cub talks slang
there is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the presses
the sugar manufacturers who says loaf clarified lumps bastard common burnt this honestest manufacturers talks slang
algebra medicine botany have each spa slang
to meet the needs of this conflict wretchedness has invented the ban wage of combat which is slain
to keep afloat and to rescue on oblivion to holds above the gulf were it but a fragment of some language which men has spoken and which would otherwise be lost that is to say one of the elements good or bad of which civilization is composed or by which it is complicated to extend the records of social observation is to serve civilization itself
phoenician very good
even dial let that pass
to this we reply and one word only
assuredly if the tongue which nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and studied
and then we insist upon it the study of social deformities and infirmities and the task of pointing them out with the view to remedy is not a business in which choices permitted
he must descend with his heart full of charity and severity at the same time as a brother and as a judge too those impenetrable casemates where crawl pell now those who bleed in those who deal the blow those who weep in those who curse those who fast in those who devour those who in door evil and those who inflicted
do we really know the mount orter well when we are not acquainted with the cavern
they constitute too different orders of facts which correspond to each other which are always into lasted and which often bring forth results
true history being a mixture of all things the true historian mingles in everything
facts form one of these and ideas the other
there it cloves itself in word masks in metaphor rags
in this skies it becomes horrible
one proceeds without understanding it a hideous murmur sounding almost like human accents but more nearly resembling a howel than inarticulate word
one thinks one hears hydras talking
it is unintelligible in the dark
it is blacken misfortune it is blacker still in crime these two blackness is amalgamated compose slang
the earth is not the void of resemblance to a jail
loo closely at lifely
it is so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment
each day has its own great grief for its little care
yesterday you re trembling for a health that is dear to you to day you fear for your owne to morrows it will be anxiety about money the day after to morrow the diet tribe of a slanderer the day after that the misfortune of some friend th the prevailing weather then something that has been broken their lost thin a pleasure with which your conscience in your veritable column reproach you again the course of public affairs
this without reckoning in the pains of the heart and so goes on
there is hardly one day out of a hundreds which is wholly joyous and sonny
and you belong to that small class youre happy
in this worlds evidently the vestibule of another there are no fortunate
the re human division is this voluminous and mis shady
to diminish the member of the shabby to augment the number of the luminous that is the object
that is why we cry education science
to teach reading means to light the fire every sal spell out sparkles
however he who says light does not ness is sadly s joy
people suffer light excess burns
the flam is the enemy of the winging
to burn without ceasing to fly therein lies the marvel of genius
you'll never dig it out of the astor library
to the young american here or were elsewhere the paths to fortune are innumerable and all open there is invitation in the air and success in all his wide horizon
he has no traditions to bind him or guide him and his impulse is to break away from the occupation his father has followed and make a new way for himself
the modest fellow would have liked vain thrust upon him for some worthy achievement it might be for a book or for the skilful management of some great newspaper or for some daring expedition like that of men it strain or doctor can
he was unable to decide exactly what it should be
sometimes he thought he would like to stand in a conspicuous pulpit and humbly preached the gospel of repentance and it even cross his mind that it would be noble to give himself to a missionary life to some the nighted region were the date palm grows and the night and gill's voice is in tune and the bull blin on the of nights
walls him to him well enough as a science but he never could discover a practical case were it appeared to him worth while to go to law and all the clients stopped with this new clerk in the anti room of the wall office for he was writing phillip invariably advised to settle no matter how but settle greatly to the disgust of his employer who knew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized processes with the attentive these
it is such a noble ambition that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow foundation
he wanted to begin at the top of the letter
billet therefore read diligently in the astor library planned literary works that should compel tention and nursed his genius
he had no friend wise enough to tell him to set into the dorking convention an in session make a sketch of the men and women on the platform and take it to the editors of the daily great vine and see what he could get aline for it
oh very well said greenow turning away with a shade of contempt you'll find if you are going into literature in newspaper work that you can't afford a conscience like that
but till u did afford it and he wrote thinking his friends and declining because he said the political scheme would fail and ought to fl
and he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world
well i'm going as inch mere you could go as one
you can begin by carrying a rod and putting down the figures
no it thought your soon
i'n ready to go anywhere for six months
the two young men who were by this time full of the adventure went down to the wall street office of henry's uncle and had to talk without wily operator
the night was spent in packing up and writing letters for philip would not cake such an important step without informing his friends
why's a missouri somewhere on the font year i think we'll get a map
i was afraid it was nearer home
he knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter
he well knew the perils of the frontier the savage state of society the lurking indians and the dangers of fever
she was tired of other things
she tried this morning an error two upon the piano saying a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic voice and then seating herself by the open windowed red philip's
well mother said the young student looking up with the shade of impatience
i hope thee told the elders that father and i re responsible for the piano and that much as the loves musick the is never in the room when it is played
i heard father till cousin abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now
thy ways greatly try me ruth and all thy relations
is thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the world's people
i have not asked him rut replied with a look that might imply that she was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own mind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with hers
mother i am going to study medicine
margaret bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual pity
a study medicine

and b sides suppose the does learn mediciney
i will practice it

ruth sat quite still for a time with face and tent and flushed it was out now
the sight seers returned in high spirits from the city
ruth asked the enthusiast if they would b to live in such a sounding muzzle m with its great halls and echoing rooms and no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of any body
and then there was broad street
there certainly was no into it and even ruth was philadelphian enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end or arch had drill blin upon which the weary eye could rest
let neither saint to roard nor broad street neither wonders of the mein nor the glories of the hall were the ghosts of our father sit always signing the declaration impressed the visitor so much as the splendors of the chestnut street windows and the bargains on eighth street
is the going to the yearly meeting ruth asked one of the girls
i have nothing to where reply that de mere person
it has occupied mother a long time to find at the shops d exact shade her new bonnet
and thee won't go wh should i
if i go to meeting at all i like best to sit in the quiet old house in german town where the windows are all open and i can see the trees and sheer the sir of leaves
if such a crush at the yearly meeting at arch street and then there's the row of sleek looking young men who lin the curbstone and sara us as we come out
he doesn't say but it's on the frontier and on the map everything beyond it is marked indians and desert and looks as desolate as a w say leading wight it was time for him to do something
is he going to started daily newspaper amongst the kick up bus
father these unjust to pill up he's going into business
he doesn't say exactly what it is said ruth a little dubiously but it's something about land and real roads and fee know's father that fortunes are made nobody knows exactly how in a new country
let fill of his honest and he asked how it enough if he will stop scribbling to make his way
one a box women are put into measured for it and putt in young if we go anywhere it's in a box bil and pinioned and shut in by disabilities
why should i rust and be stupid and sit in a action because i am a girl
and if i had a fortune would be want me to lead a useless life
has de consulted thy mother about a career i suppose it is a pearly wants
but that wise and posed woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than ruth understood herself
ruth was glad to hear that philip had made a push into the world and she was sure that his talent and courage would make away for him
but the more forgetfulness had then prevailed the more powerful was the force of remembrance when she awoke
miss milner's health is not good
said missus wharton a few minutes after
so there is to may ad it stamford with a sarcastic near
and yet you must own her behavior has warranted them has it not been in this particular incoherent and unaccountable
not that i know of not one more that i know of he replied with astonishment at what she had insinuated and yet with a perfect assurance that she was in the wrong
perhaps i am mistake and answered she
to ask any more questions of you i believe would be unfair
he seemed to wait for her reply but as she made none he proceeded
oh my lord cried miss woodley with a most forcible accent you are the last person on earth she would pardon me were entrusting
but in such ac case miss milner's election of a husband shall not direct mine
if she does not know how to estimate her own value i do
independent of her fortune she has beauty to captivate the heart of any man and with a her follies she has a frankness in her manner an unaffected wisdom in her thoughts of avidity in her conversation and withal a softness in her demeanour that might alone engage the affections of a man of the nicest sentiments and the strongest understanding
my lord miss milner's taste is not a depraved one it is but too refuted
what can you mean by that miss woodley you talk mysteriously
is she not afraid that i will forward her inclinations
again he searched his own thoughts nor ineffectually as before
miss woodley was too little versed in the subject to know this would have been not to love at all at least not to the extent of breaking through engagements and all the very solaces that still mitigated against their union
to relieve her from both he laid his hand with force upon his heart and said do you believe me
i will make no unjust use of what i know he replied with firmness i believe you my lords
i have never yet however been vanquished by them and even upon this occasion my reason shall come bat them to the last and my reason shall fail me before i do wrong
yes dead these four years and a good job for her too
well as i say it's an awful queer world they clap all the burglars and jan the murderers in the white beaters i allays thought a gentle reprove would be up punishment for a wife beater cause he probably has a lot of provocation that nobody knows and the fire bugs can't think of the right name seth like candies and the breakers of the peace and what not and yet the law has nothin to say to a man ike hand lord

ben zeus's most ambitious desire was to induce the captain to go with him and end his days in his much loved home and so incessantly were servadac's ears besieged with descriptions of the unparalleled beauties and advantages of this eighteenth our undisposed that he could scarcely here the name of mont mara without a conscious thrill of a version
when a private in the eighth cavalry he had been on the point of quitting the army at twenty eight years of age but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to captain servadac
the bond of union thus effected could never be severed and although ben's achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement he firmly declined all honours or any pension that might part him from his superior officer
unlike his master he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power but his inexhaustible memory made him a living in syclopedia and for his stock of anecdotes and trooper's tales he was matchless
fast as his legs could carry him serve back had made his way to the top of the cliff
it was quite true that a vessel was insight hardly more than six miles from the shore but owing to the increase in the earth's convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision the rigging of the topmasts alone was visible above the water
exclaimed servadac keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope
she is under sail that she is counted as chefs yacht he was right
if the count were on board a strange vitality was bringing him to the presence of his rival
he reckoned therefore not only upon ascertaining the extent of the lake catastrophe but upon learning its cause

servadac took it for granted that the d bruno was endeavouring to put in
a narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the roughest weather would insure the calmness of its waters
slightly changing her course she first struck her main sail and an order to facilitate the movements of her helmsman soon carried nothing but her two top sails brigantine and jib
captain servadac hastened towards him
i left you on a continent and here i have the honor of finding you on an island
never mind now interposed the captain we will talk of that by and by
nothing more than you know yourself
are youse certain that this is the mediterranean
for some moments he seemed perfectly stupified and then recovering himself he began to overwhelmed the count with a torrent of questions
to all these inquiries the count responded in the affirmative
some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements
you will take me on board count will you not
m yacht is at your service sir even should you require to make a t around the world
the count shook his head
before starting it was indispensable that the engine of the debris should be repaired to sail under canvas only would in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficult
it was on the last day of january that the repairs of the schooner were completed
a slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide
doubts now arose and some discussion followed whether or not it was desirable for bene to accompany his master
her sea going qualities were excellent and when an amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe
after an apprenticeship on a merchantship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private god in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters
the late astounding events however had rendered procope manifestly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the counts secretly partook of his own anxiety
steam up and canvass spread the schooner started eastwards
although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earth's attraction rendering the liquid particle so buoyant that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented

another circumstance was most remarkable
to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniformed depth of from fortify fathoms and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the sight of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheatre
you must see lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you imagined
after pondering a while he said if we were farther away i should expect to find a depths of two or three hundreds fathoms instead of five fathoms five fathoms
its depth remained invariable still four or at most five fathoms and although its bottom was assiduously dredged it was only to prove it baron of marine production of any type

you know captain lake
said lord chelford addressing me
he had his hand upon lake shoulder
they are cousins you know we are all cousins
whatever lord chelford said miss brandon received it very graciously and even with a momentary smile
but her greeting to captain lak was more than usually haughty and frozen and her features i fancied particularly proud and pale
at dinner lake was easy of a musing
i'm glad you like it says wilder chuckling benignantly on it over his shoulder
i believe i have a little taste that way those are all real you know those jewels
and he placed it in that gentleman's fingers who now took his turn the lamp and contemplated the little parallelogram with a gleam of sly amusement
i was thinking it's very like the ace of hearts answered the captain softly smiling on
whereupon lake laughed quietly still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes
and wild they left too more suddenly and noisily than the humour of the joke seemed quite to call for and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes unlike but the gallant captain did not seem to perceive it and after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently back to missus dorothy only remarking

miss lake declined the carriage to night

they don't these very wise things sometimes turned out very foolishly
in the meantime i had formed an you idea of her
by this time lord chelford and wilder returned and disgusted rather with myself i roman needed on my want of generalship

now that's impossible radie for really don't think i once thought of him all this evening except just rob were talking
there was a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves and the model whites and shadows glided oddly across his pale features

when i say is altogether on your own accounts
mark my words you'll find him too strong for you i and to deep
im very uneasy about it whatever it is i can't help it
to my minds there has always been something inexpressibly awful in family fields
the mystery of their origin their capacity for evolving latent faculties of crime and the study vitality with which they survived the hearse and speak their deep mouth malignities in every newborn generation have associated them somehow in my mind with a spell of life exceeding and distinctive for human and especial satanic action
the form were than anything else showed the great age of the room
my bad was unexceptional be comfortable thought in my that mood i could have wished it the great deal more modern
its curtains worked thick and faded tapestry
all the furniture belonged to other times
i shan't trouble you about my train of thoughts or fancies but i began to feel very like a gentleman in the g story watching experimentally in a haunted chamber
i did not even take the precaution of smoking up the chimney
i bold be lighted my chute
a cold bright moon was shining with clear sharped lights and shadows
the somber old trees one gigantic cars plumes black and awful
somehow i had grow nervous
a little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly
it was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of redman's farm
well she was better though she had had a ab night
so there came a step and the little rustling of feminine dry breeze the small door opened and rachel entered with her hand extended and a pale smile of welcome
women can hide their pain better than we men and bear it better two except when shame drops fire into the dreadful challis
but poor rachel leak had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile
this transit springing and lighting up are beautiful a glamour beguiling our senses
there was something of sweetness and fatness in her tones and manner which was new rachel and comforting and she returned the greeting as kindly and felt more like her for herself
rachel's pale and sharpened features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise
you have been so ill my poor rachel
ill and troubled dear troubled in mind and miserably nervous
poor rachel her nature recoiled from deceit and she told at all events as much of the truth as she dared
she spoke with a sudden energy which partook a fear and passion and flushed her thing cheek and made her languid eyes flash
think you rachel my cousin rachel my only friend
chelford had a note from mister wilder this morning another note his cunning delayed and something of his having to see some person who was abroad continued durk u after a little pause
yes something everything said rachel hurriedly looking frowningly at a flower which she was twirling in her fingers
yes said rachel
and the wan oracle having spoken she sat down in the same sort of abstraction again beside dorus and she looked full in her cousin's eyes
of mark wylder i say this his name has been for years hateful to me and recently it has become frightful and you will promise me simply this that you will never ask me to speak again about him
it is an antipathy and antipathy i cannot and over dear dorus you may think it of madness but don't blame me
i have very few to love me now and i thought you might love me as i have begun to love you
and she threw her arms round her cousins neck and brave rachel at last burst into tears
dorcas in her strange way was moved
i like you still rachel i'm sure ill always like you
you resemble me rachel you are fearless and inflexible and generous
yes rachel i do love you

monte shay called out for robin to give him an arm
friend said montfichet faintly to the wrestlers bear us escort so far as the sheriffs house

notting young castle was reached and admittance was demanded
master mono the sheriff of nottingham was mightily putt about when told of the riding
and henry might return to england at any moment
have your will childe if the boy also will sydney monkeys shay answered feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then
he made an effort to hide his condition from them all and robin felt his fingers tighten upon his arm
beg me a room of the sheriff childe quickly
but who is this fellow blocking and her speed
he is my esquire excellency returned robin with dignity
mistress fitzooth had been carried off on the sheriffs daughter in her maids as soon as they had entered the house said that robing alone had the care of moony shay
robin was glad when at length they were left to their own devices
the wind had certainly bring back the colour to the squire's cheeks
these escapades are not for old game well lad his day has come to twilight
will you forget me now
it'll be no disappointment to me
no thanks i am glad to give you such easy happiness
you are worthy leech will presently whispered robin the whine has worked a marvel
i and show you some pretty tricks
young fitzooth had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his congress with the squire
there be fell an anxious interview mistress fitzooth aging four and against the squire's projecting a breath
most of all robin thought of his father what would he counsel
if f wind you beggar yourself i cannot stay you
but take it whilst i live and where mony shee shield in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so brave as site for you will nearer disgrace our stuck and i warrant me
the latter crim and
never that sir he had said
he was in deep converse with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arms
now to bed boy
tis late and i go myself within a short space
dismiss your squire robin and bid me good een
as any in england i would say said came we proudly that is in his day
yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come
there was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to gamewell's chamber
presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step
will cried he softly and studley who had chosen his couch across the door of his young master's chamber sprang up at once at answer
we will go out together to the bower theres a way down to the court from my window
rest and be still until i warn you
the hours pas wearily by and move that could yet be heard about the hall
at last all was quiet and blacken the courtyard of gamewell
will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready
they then renewed their journey and under the better light made a save crossing of the stable roofs
robin entered the hut dragging the unwilling esquire after him
be not so foolish friend said fitzooth crossly
they moved thereafter cautiously about the hut groping before an about them to find something to show that the more intoned ful filled his mission
they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and starting had tripped over the edge of the revers flat mouth of this pit
fitzooth's hand rested at last upon the top rung of the ladder and slowly the truth came to him
robin carefully descended the latter and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground
studley was by his side in the flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape in character of his vault
from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice wantons
save the masters but you startled me rarely
cried he waving the lantern before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him
inquired robin with his suspicion still upon him
truly such a horse would be worth much in noting him fair
nay nay lording answered warrant in with a half laugh
warrant and spoke thus with s diffuses to show robin that he was not to think jeffreys claimed to the estate would he passed by
robin fit sooth saw that his doubts of warrant and had been unfair and he became ashamed of himself for harboring them
his tones rang pleasantly un warrant ands ears and forthwith the good fellowship was heralded between them
the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gave well that this passageway led from the hut in a pleasance to sherwood and that jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
he implores us to be discreet as the grave in this matter for en sooth his life in the hollow of our hands
they regained their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gamewell
out in the wood stood a nice little fir tree
the place he had was a very good one the sun shone on him as su fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as furs
he did not thinking of the warms sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cotta children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
but this was what the tree couldn bear to hear
in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hair would often come leaping along and jumped right over a little tree
o that made him so angry
to grow and grow to get on and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most might ful thing in the world
in autumn the woodcutters always came and felled some of the largest trees
this happened every year and the young fir tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight for the magnificence great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and beare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were lid in carts and the horses dragged of them out of the wood
have you not met them anyone
rejoys and thy growth said the sunbeams
and then what happens then
i would fay now if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh
were i but already on the cart
where i in the warn room with all the splendor and magnificence
yes and something better something still grander will surely followed or wherefore should they thus ornament me
something better something still grander must follow but what
with choice in our presence so the air and the sunlight
rejoice in my own fresh youth
but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter in summer
and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
the axe struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pangs like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful that being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
the departure was not at all agreeable
the tre on he came to himself when he was unloaded in a court yard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we donned want the others
there two were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture books and full of toys were hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the children said so
the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
this evening they all said
how it will shine this evening
perhaps the other trees from the forests will come to look git me
it blazed up famously help help
cried the young ladies and they quickly putt out the fire
a story
a story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree
but i shall tell only one story
how be dont be fell downstairs and yet he married the princess
that's the way of the world
thought the fir tree and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
i won't tremble to morrow thought the fir tree
and whole night the tree stoodst still and in deep thought
in the morning the servants and the housemaid came in
but they dragged him out of the room and up stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
what the meaning of this thought the tree
and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie
time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way
tis now a winter out of doors thought the tree
how kind man is after all
if don only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely
sleek squeak
they snuffed about the fir tree and rustled among the branches
i am by no means old said the fir tree
there's many a one considerably older than i am
they were so extremely curious
i know no such place said the tree
and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said
said the fir tree thinking over what he had himself related
yes in reality those more happy times
h is upp don't he asked the mice
only that one answered the tree
it is a very s stupid story
don't you one about bacon and cello canoes canst you tell any latter stories
no said the tree
then good by said the rats and they went oa
at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listen to what i told them
now that too is ovver
why one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in loft
the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and throne rather harde it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
but it was not the fir tree that they meant
it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
in the courtyards some of the married children were playing who had danced at christmas round the fir tree and were so glad at the sight of him
and the gardener's boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and it side sod deeply
however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end
kenneth them beth refrained from telling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogers visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned who closely about the penalty for fortune a cheque
it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and ton gates beg fair to serve the lengthy term in the states prison as a consequence of his rash apt
i can't see it in that light said the old lawyer
it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved
but they could not have prove in a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably a mere bluff
he was soft hearted and impetuous said beth at being a love he didn't stop to count the cost
if the prosecution or it withdrawn and they case settled with the victim of the fort cheque then the young man would be allowed is freedom
but under the circumstances i doubt of such an ar it could be made
fair view was twelve miles away but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county dle
they were received in the little office by a man n market who was the jailer
we wish to talk with him answered kenneth talk
i'm writing for representative on their republic can ticket said kenneth quietly
i'll say that's different observed market altering his demeanor
maybe see gates at once asked
they followed the jailer along the succession of passages
sometimes on that yearning for a smoke a merely crazy an add know which is course died one way or other
he unlocked the door and called here's visitor's tom
worse tom horse and error replied the jailer cooly
mister graf said kenneth noticing the boy's face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it
sorr we have an any reception room in the jail
sit tow please said gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice theres a pens
a fresh wholesome looking boy was stone gates was steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth
we have heard something of your story said kenneth and are interested in it
i didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and i'm glad i did it
old well as a fine fellow but poor in helpless since missus rogers had her accident
then rods wouldn't do anything but leader around and weighed upon her and the place went to rack in ruin
he spoke simply but paced up and down to narrow cell in friend of them
who's name gid you sign to the check asked kenneth
he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concert
it's a stop company in rich
i was bit keeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forged the signature
as regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved him a heavy loss one day
i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed theo plant former shall never even think the
it was better for him to think the girl unfailingly to know the truth
i'm going to see mister marshall said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thank you sir
it won't be much but un grateful to find a friend
they left him then for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office
i see whats at that kind in my day
and it ruins of ann's disposition
he looked up rather ungracious weep but motion them to be seated
some girls been in youre twice to interview my men and i have refused to admit her
am not electioneering just now
how well sir what about him
and he deserves a term in states prison
has cost me tee sixty dollars and annoyance
i'll pay all the cause b sight
you're foolish why should you do all this
i have my old reason's mister marshal
give me a check for thundering fifty had altered over to you the fort cheque and quashed further proceedings
he detested the grasping dispiteous soon that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help the young gates
firth uneasy of silence nudged him
there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face
he might have had that forged check for the face of it if he'd been sharp
and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars
so to the surprise at the democratic committee and all his friends mister hopkins announced that he would oppose forts aggressive campaign with an equals aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
one of misor hopton first tasks after calling his faithful henchman around him was to make a careful countess of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
the weak need contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundreds votes in one way or the other secured from an opposition
the democratic committee figured out away to do this
under ordinary conditions rebels was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to i at hopkins
the ely thing necessary was to fix seth rena's and this hopkins arranged personally
and this was white kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the younger woman in the buggy
the descriptions she gave of the coming reception to the women's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were
these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist an electing mister forbes
louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted
the fair view band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house or taxed to entertain the guess
tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty at substantial repast was to be served
this was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given it elmhurst and the only when within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been the invited guests
the attendants was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted fore seeing great success for their fight
we ought to have more attendants beth said louise approaching her cousin
won't you run into the house and see if martha can't spare one or two more maids
she was very fond of the young ladies whom she had build when au jane was their mistress here and beth was her special favourite
the housekeeper led the way in beat followed
for a moment best stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and of slight smile upon her beautiful face
she was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at elmhurst a plaining black gown with a white apron and cap
that she gave a little lu and replied n miss beth e elisabeth parsons
but it can't be protested the girl
i attend to a household bending you know and care for the linen
you speak like an educated persons said beth wonderingly where is your home
for the first time the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor
she sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rock slowly back and forth i'm sorry said beth
eliza parson shook her head
they they excite me in some way and i i can't bear them you must excuse me
she even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted
beth was a beautiful girl the handsomest of the three cousins by far yet eliza surpassed her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact
her manner was neither independent north certain but rather one of well bred composure and calm relies
her eyes wandered to the maid hand
however her features in form might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story
she rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath
i wish i knew myself she cried fiercely
would you leave be alone in my own room or must ee go way to escape you
eliza close the door behind her with it decided swam and the key clicked in the lock
common chord were turned its place amidst the tents
english voted to the french baskets of flowers of which they had made a punta b provision to gree be arrival of the young princess the french in returned invited the english to a supper which was to be given the next t
he gratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey
from the respect pain her on all sides she seemed like a queen and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three she appeared an object of worship the queen mother gave the french the most affectionate reception france was her native country and she had suffered too much unhappiness in england for england who have made her forget friends
she taught her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had both been hospitably received and where a brilliant future open for them
the count had throne himself back on his seat leading his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus his face buried in his hands with heating chest and restless limbs
this has indeed been a harassing day continued the young man his eyes fixed upon his friend
you will be frank with me a ow hiss a
can your imagine my buckingham has been so violent i suspect
it is you r m beacon row i have red as distressing his eyes in his every gesture and action the whole day
i can perceive love clearly enough
i am confined of what i say said the count
it is annoyance then
in those very terms i even added more
but continued weal not interrupted by this moment of his friend haven be praised the french who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet reckless even are capable of bringing a calm and sound goodmen to barrow matters of such high importance
thus it is that the honor of thia saint are country are masters and our own
yes i me repose many things have agitated be to nay both in line and body when you returned to morrow i shall no longer be the same man
but in this friendly pressure row could detect the meran agitation of a great internal conflict
the night was clear starlit and splendid the tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life peace and security everywhere
upon the large square in front of the hotel the shadows of the tents intersected by the golden moonbeams formed as it were a huge mosaic of jet and yellow flag stones
bridal washed for some time the conduct up the two lovers listened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of manicamp who snored as impiously as though he in wearying his eldon gold in stone his violet suit
the liath makes another discovery
they were subtly n near the solution of their problem
the poor little things cried sin pia think of them having been turned to the wall all these ears
now what is the sense of it two wins if bag iss like that
but joyce had not eliciting all at once she put on her candle on the table and faced or companion
the twin brother did something she didn't like and she turned his picture to the wall
hers happened to be on the same frame too but she evidently dink care about it
now what have you to say s this bragg
i thought we were stumped again when i first saw that picture but it spent of some us after all
do youse suppose the mature was a copy of the same thing
one of the world visit query choice
they were any terribly em besides unlight to see what this lovely furniture looks like without such quantities of dust over it d it schemes in
will come andy he this afternoon with old clothes on and half a regular house cleaning
it can't heard anything i'm sure for we won't disturb things at all
this fawn however did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair
smuggle in the house cleaning paraphernalia into the cellar window unobserved that afternoon proved no easy task for scythia had added a wis boom and dust pan to the outset
the lure proved too much for him and he came sporting after as frisk lily as a young kitten much to simply as delight when she caught sight of him
oh let him come along she urged id loved to seek him about that old house
he makes it sort of pier
mow let's does the furniture and pictures
yet little as it was it had already made an a fast difference in the aspect of the room
surface des at least had been leaved and the fine oldest furniture gave a hints of its real elegance polish
then she suddenly remarked
and my pocket money is getting low again and you have it any left as usual
they say i lumination by candlelight as the previous in the world
why it's comme ath as usual they both cried peering in
is that he the greatest r begin to odd corners
forgetting all their weariness they seethe the candles and street through the house finding on occasional paper tucked away in some add corner
well i confessed that the boarded up house mystery happened not earlier than april sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probably not much leader
no words were spoken no language was uttered saint d of winging in hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and g in reality
i heard a noise behind i turned and saw kaffer his blacks eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted above his head as if to strike but i had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me
onward set a distant voice
no sound broke the stillness of the night
the story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition i wondered whether there was not some truth and what had been said
what was that
what then a human hand large and shape we have here distinctly on the surface of the pond
nothing more not even the wrist to which it might be attached
it did not beckon or indeed moved all it was as still as the hand of death
i awoke to consciousness fighting at first it seemed as if i was fighting with the phantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was caher
a sound of voices a flash of light
a feeling of freedom and i was awake where
said another voice would ii recognize that fal chose caff
i had scarcely known when i had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke i looked at my hand
in the light of the moon i saws a knife red with blood and my hand too was also discoloured
i do not know i am dazed bewildered
but that is calf's life
i know y he had at this very evening
i remembered saying half we didn't together
oh chair picked up something from the ground and looked at it
i say you do know what this means and you must tell usin
a terrible thought flashed into my mind
i had again been acting under the influence of this man's power
perchance too calf's death might serve him in good stead
my tongue refused articulate my power of speech left me
my position was too terrible
my overwrought nerved healed at last
for some time after that i remembered nothing distinctly
the three modes of management
to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in affecting such a substitution is that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
by reason and affection
as the chase drives away marry stands bewildered and perplexed on the doorstep her mind in a tumults of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexation and ill humor surge and swell among those delegate organizations on which the s structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps andrea injury
the mother as soon as the chase is so far turned that marry can no longer watch the expression of her confidence goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satis faction on her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice
so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but we'll stay at home contentedly won't you
the mother in managing the case in this way realized partly unconvincing the reason of the childs and partly on an appealed to her affection
if you should not be a good girl but should show signs of making us any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone
but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if marry has been habitually managed on mis principle she will not make any trouble
it is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the younger and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection cannot be overrated
to such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
deah had a young sister in maria and a cousin whose name was jane
now jellia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls
to give an idea of these conversations i will report one of them in full
you have come an della and della was the name of jamal to make rosalie a visit
i am very glad
i expect you have been a very good gurl adela since you were here last
then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has sheep in a good girl jane
for instance one day the children had been plain upon the piazza with blocks and other playthings and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
they were n now plain with their dolls in the parlour
delia came to the parlor and with an air of great mystery beckoned the children aside and said to them in a whisper leave an bela and rosy here and don't say awd them
so saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the rooms and round by a sir cutest root to the piazza there
said she pointing the playthings see
puts these play things all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know anything about your leaving them out
and this method of tree the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been
nature of the effect produced by early impressions
that he is comparatively nothing
they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
we of going to any such extreme as this we can easily see on reflection how vast in influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action im theatre years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impress upon the mind
the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a fathers subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
but ands cared nothing about that
he made bow so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dumfounded i can tell you when he sawn it was nobody but ands
he was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife
now this knife was a splendid one though half the blab was gone and handle was a little cracked and ands knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife
yes why not thought enders
seeing that i am so five i may as well go and does it the king
i am going to the court ball answered enders
and she took and her's hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers reposed at every thirds step and threw the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing wherever he went
for like as not they must have fought him a prince when they saw his fine cap
at the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rose
on huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters
the princes sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets a roses and she let er sit in a golden chair by her side
but you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to day get off
the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly like to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition
he only shook his head
well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him
that is a very fine cap you has he said
so it is said enders
and it is made of mother's best yarn and she knitted it herself and everybody once to get it away from me
with one jump ands got out of his chair
he darted lake an arrow through all the halls down all the stairs and across the yards
he still held onto it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open
but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a king's golden crown he said that ands was a stupid
and' face grew red
but his mother h been close
no my little son she said
if you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap
at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five o'clock the king entered his cabinet where his tailors or awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court
ah very well
let him come in then said the king and as if colbert had been ling at the door for the purpose of keeping himself o koran with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two cartier
gentleman dear posts whereupon saint any in deil ey took their leave
certainly sire but i must have money to do that what
what do main inquired louise
he has given them with too much grace not to have utter still to give if they are required which as the case at the present moment
it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned
does your majesty then no longer believe the disloyal attent
not at all you are on the contrary most agreeable to me
your majesty's plan then in this affair is
you will take them from my private treasure
the news circulated with the rapidity of lightning during its progress it kindled every variety coquetry desire and wild ambition
the kan had completed his toilet by nine o'clock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers
the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dis or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theater of wonderful elegance of construction
suddenly for the purpose of restoring piece in order springing accompanied by his whole court made his appearance
the seasons allies of spring followed him closely to form a quadrille which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the dance
his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage in flesh colored silken hose a silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
there was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did' not dance so much as seemed to sore alone
yes it is suppressed
far from its sire your majesty haven't given no directions about it the musicians have retained it
yes sire and ready dressed for the ballet
sire he said your majesty's most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasioned with similar zeal that he h already shown on the field of battle
the king seemed only pleased with everyone present
monsieur was the only one who didn not understand anything about the matter
the bally began the effect was more than beautiful
when the musick by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutored pantomime of that period only the more natural on account of the very indifferent acting of the august actors had reached its culminating point of triumph the theatre shook with tumultuous applause
disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgment he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the market preference of the princess
by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his hadad drooped as though he was stupefied
the king who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille cast a look upon his vanquished rival
everyone could observe his agitation and prostration a prostration which was indeed the m remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and his eyes without their bright intelligence be dimmed
upon this this madam dig to turn her eyes languishingly towards the conte observing
do you think so she replied with indifference
yes the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own
explain yourself
i lone to the goddess
the princess enquired no
she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance
the arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally
a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theater but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love is thus strangely constituted he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from their presence of one who had broken his heart
when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous have concealing from herself
remain i implore you the evening is most lovely
indeed a
i remember now and i congratulate myself do you love anyone
forgive me i hardly know what i am saying the thousand times forgive me madame was right quite right this brutal exile has completely turned my brain
there cannot be a doubt he received you kindly for in fact you returned without his permission
oh mademoiselle why have i not a devoted sister or a true friend such as yourself
why already here they said to her
i have been here this quarter of an hour replied levi

let us run then set all three and gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thickest cupboard of the park
in fact the sound of m dams and the queen's carriages could be heard in the distance upon the hard dry grounded of the roads followed by the mountain cavaliers
in this way the fed of the whole court was a fat also for the mysterious inhabitants of the forest for certainly the deer in the break the pheasant on the branch the fox in its whole were all listening
all about him was a tumult of bright and broken color scattered in broads splashes
the merganser had a crested head of ear descent green black a broad collar of lustrous white black back black and white wings white belly sides finely penciled and blacken light and a breast of rich chestnut red streaked with black
his feet were read his long narrow beak with its saul toothed edges and sharp hooked tip was bright red
but here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls hawks and eagles he had no rending calls
but suddenly street and swift as a dive in crate he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface
once fairly awing however he wielded and mad back hurriedly for his perch
and might have seemed that a trout of this size will a fairly substantial meal
but such was his keenness that even while the wide flues of his en gorged victim were still sticking out of the cars of his beak his fierce redd eyes of were once more appearing downward into the torrent in search a fresh prey
in despair he hurled himself downwards too soon
the great hawk fouled hurriedly to retreat his prey from the ground
the cat growled softly picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted int the bushes to devour it
in fact he had just finish oop the last of the trout's tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strange gullet when the baffled haw caught sight of him and swooped
the hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as of surprised
like his unfortunate little cousin the teal he too had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank deep fringed with weeds where the dreadful ey of the hawk should not discern him
the hawks sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface
almost instantly who has forced to the top
straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him
but at this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down
but this frequenter of the heights of air for all his savage valor was troubled at the leaping waves and the tossing foam of these mad rapids he did not understand them
as he flew his down reaching clutching talons were not half a yard ab the fugitive's head
where the ways for an instant sank they came closer but not quite within grasping reach
but as before the leaping waves at the rapids were too much for his pursuer and you will able to flap his way onward in the cloud of foam old doom hung lo above his head yet hesitated to strike
the hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged and pursuit as a weasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived
he had a lot of line out and the place was none too free for a long cast but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was speeding
the last drop fly as luck with habit caught just in the corner of the hawk's angrily opened beak cooking itself firmly
at the sudden sharp stinging of it the great bird turned his head and noticed for the first time the fisherman standing on the bank
the drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable him and appalling

several hundred free state men promptly responded to the summons
it was in fact the best weapon of its day
the leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town
one at his militia generals suggested that the governor should require the outlaws at lawrence and elsewhere to surrender the sharp's rifles another wrote asking him to call out the government troops at for leven worth
the governor on his part becoming doubtful of the legality of employing missy militia to enforce kansas laws was also eager to secure the help of federal troops
sheriff jones had his pockets always full of writs issued in the spirit of persecution that was often baffled by the sharp wits and ready resources of the free state people and sometimes defied outright

though throwing to prison for this enterprise and detained some time he was not discouraged but still continued by his countenance and protection to infuse spirit into the distressed royalists
among other persons of distinction who united themselves to him was lord napier of march son of the famous inventor of the lub rums the person to whom the title of a great man is more justly due than to any other whom his country ever produced
while former foretold that the scottish cover enters were secretly forming a union with the english parliament and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking the latter still insisted that every such attempt would precipitate then into measures to which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined
the king's ears were now opened to montrose counsels who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal caws in scotland
five hundred men more who had been levied by the can enters were persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combined force he hastened to attack lord alco who lay at perth with an army of six thousand men assembled upon the first mars of the irish invasion
dreading the superior power of ar dial who having joined his vassals to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerable army montrose hastened northwards in order to rouse again the marquise of hope le u gordons who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the covenanters
this nobleman's character though celebrated for political courage and conduct was very low for military prowess and after some stern wishes in which he was worsted he here aloud montrose to escape him
by quick marchers through these inaccessible mountains that general freed himself from the superior forces of the covenanters
with these and some reinforcements of the ethel menan and dolls whom he had recalled montrose fou suddenly upon ar giles country and let loose upon it all the rage of war carrying off the cattle burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword
this severity by which montrose sullied his victories was the results of private animosity against the chieftain as much as of zeal for the public cause our guile collecting three thousand men marched in quest of the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at inner lucky supposing himself still at a considerable distance from them
by a quicks and unexpected march montrose hastened to inner lucky and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised but not a frightened covenants
his conduct and presence of mind in this emergence appeared conspicuous
montrose weak in cavalry here lined his troops of horse with infantry and after putting the enemy's horse to route fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cut in pieces o with the loss of the gallant lord gordon on the part of the royalists
from the same men new regiments and new companies were formed different officers appointed and the hall military force put into such hands as the independence could on
besides members of parliament who were excluded many officers ogling to serve under the new generals threw up their commissions unwarily facilitated the projects of putting the army entering into the hens of that faction
their be discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible a more exacts plan was introduced and rigorously executed by these new commanders
valor indeed was very generally diffused over the one party as well as the others during this period discipline also was attained by the forces of the parliament but the perfection of the military art in concerting the general plans of action and the operations of the field scenes still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting

before the settlement of terms the administration must be possessed entirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms and how incompatible that skin with the liberty of the king is easily imagined

the analysis of knowledge will occupy u until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
would is called perceptions differs from sensation by the facts that the sensational ingredients bringing up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual cleats all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
whether not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that i does approximately represent impressions
and what sort of evidence is logically possible
there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world spring into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with the population that remembered a wholly unreal past
all that im doing is to use its logical tina ability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
the behaviourist who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour has distrust his memory in making the record
habit is a concepts involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
but i do not think such an inference is warranted
our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristics of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a france face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
some images like some sensations fill very familiar while others fill strange
familiarity is a filling capable of degrees
in an image of a well known face for example some parts may fl more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of de past
they must have some characteristics which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness and some remembered event
there may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of fastness especially where immediate memory is concerned
there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such fillings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events
if we had retained the subjects or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
remembering has to be of present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered
some points may be taken ives fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
in this case as in most others what may be taken a certain in advance is rather v
the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least served to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediate sey
this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to thus the incidents of its past and people are not so different from ground phones as they like to believe
i can set to wor now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
simmons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
they give laws according to which images of pasts occurrence is come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge
it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leaves us to search the environment until we are satisfy that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling a familiarity alone
a further stage is recognition
recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more that a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristics we may happen to recognize in the catt of the moment
we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an objects that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first since and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word
this knowledge is memory and one sense though in another it is not
there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory a among the most important
thus if i recognize the thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition the recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is single doubt from the rest of the world
of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
i remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light
had e her crasweller not been good looking had jack been still at college had sir canning toon ovver remained in england had mister bonnet and the barkeeper not succeeded and stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in arraying for the final departure of my old friend
on arriving at home at my own residence i found that our salon was filled with a brilliant company
as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mode of addressed that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self
i have come to your sure as mister president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world
we have our little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rose water
we are quite satisfied now captain battle axe said my wife
quite satisfied said eva
the ladies in compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic are on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed or on the other
no doubt in process of time the ladies will follow
there masters said missus never bent
i did not mean said captain ble lax the touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this
missus never been you must indeed be proud of your son
jack had been standing in the far corner the room talking to eva and was now reduced the silence by his praises
sir kennington oval is very fine player said my wife
i and my wife and sun and the two cress wells and three or four others agreed to dam bo the shipped on the next
this i felt was paid to me as being president other republick and i endeavoured to behave myself such mingled humility and dignity as might be fit the occasion but i could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life
my wife on the spur the moment managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner
this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with there
then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part to fathers and mothers of the young ladies
oh yes a jack and i'm nowhere
but i mean to have my innings before long
of what missus never b had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplice her tasks with thorough success
we sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then went ashore
how much of evil of real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me during the last few days
w cy do now but just lay myself down and die
and the death of which i dropt could not alas
when this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the furthest side of the island and they are in seclusion what i end my days
jack would become either's happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world
thinking of all this i went sleep
mister never bend began the captain and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president they cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
you have received us with all that courtesy in hospitality for which your character in england stand so high
it is a duty said i
but your power is so supper to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace and yielding to it
not a dal but had your force been only double or trouble our own i should have found at my duty to struggle with you
that is all quite true mister never been said sir ferdinand brown
i can afford to smile because i am absolutely perilous before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force
you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have been on board
then said sir fernando there is nothing for it but that we must take you with him
there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
you hear what sur ferdinand o brown h s replied captain battle ax
but one is a delicate mission i asked
i was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage and mattered not which
then the republic of britain ea was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor in stalled in the executive chambers
you may be quite shorts there said captain battle axe and that i can so use it asked to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board
you propos to kidnap me i said
what will become of your gun or i to cannot you
lieutenant cross tries is a very gallant officer
one of us always remains on board while the others on sure
what world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible my just like centred itself on sur ferdinand
you will allow me to suggest that he but that is a matter of opinion
were i to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter
the letter ran as follows
sir i have ant in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crowned colony which is called britain ma
the procure their circumstances of the colony are within your excellency's knowledge
but in their selection of a constitution the britain e lists have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has from their present difficulties
it is founded on the acknowledge weakness of those who survive at pio of life at which men cease to work
but it is surmise that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your governor
the john bright is arm with a weapon of great power against which it is impossible that the people of britain ea should prevail
you will carry out with you one h her men of the north northwest birmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own sturdy as it is thought that if mister never been be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience
w you inten that the john bright shall starr
today i shouted
and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the arise of the government
i shall be happy to take charge of them said sur fernando
they of course must all the author
or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible
your power is sufficient i said
if you will give us your promise to meet captain a ox here at this time to morrow we will stretch a point and delayed the departure of the john bright for twenty four hours
and this plan was adopted too in order to extract for me a promise that i would depart in peace
this was what did the mischief so far as the running away was concerned

chapter three as master wishes
three seconds before the arrival of j bee hobson's letter i know more dream of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the northwest passage
even so i had just return from an arduous journey exhausted and badly meeting rest
i wanted nothing more than to see by country again a friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved collections
but now nothing could hold me back
cas say was my man's servants
from rubbing shoulders with scientists in a little universe by the botanical gardens the boy had come to know a thing or two
classifying was everything to him so he do nothing else well versed in a theory of classification he was poorly first in its practical application and doubt that he could tell a sperm wale from a balan waal
and yet what a fine gallant lad
not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of the journey
never did he object to buckling up his suit case for any country whatever china or the congo no matter how far off it was
he went here there and everywhere in perfect contentment
place forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting that i had turned forty
he was a fanatic on formality and he only addressed me in the third person to the point where got hy some
there was good reason to stop and think even for the world's most in motionless man
cass i called a third time cuss appeared
deid masters summon me he said entering
pack as much into my trunk as you can my traveling kit my suits shirts and socks don't brot ac counting just squeal inn and hurry
will deal with them later what
anyhow will leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to france
yes we are certainly i replied evasively but after we mate a detour
a route slightly less direct that's all
were leaving on the abraham lincoln
you see my friend it's an issue of the monster the notorious nor a wall
we don't know wherever will take us
but were going just the same
we have a commander whose game for anything
i left instructions for shipping my contains of stuffed animals and dried plants to paris france
i opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the barbara and conseil at my heels i jumped into a carriage
our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate i rushed aboard
i asked for commander fergit
one of the sailors led me to the after deck where i stood in the presence of a smart looking officer who extended his hand to me
in person welcome aboard professor your cabin is waiting for you
i was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officer's mass
will be quite comfortable here i told conseil
and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some scepticism
the wharves of brookland and every part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers
de party from five hundred thousand throats three cheers burst forth in successions
thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hailing the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new york city
then he roche downstairs into the courtyards shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to catch everybody his dominions at the sailor was not recaptured
cold him fast manon an and as soon as i had my coffee in i'll take him to the room of the great knife and patch him
i wouldn't mind n up a gulfy myself said cam i've had considable ex sits eyes this mornin and i'm m or any for breakfast
but cap'n bill made no such attempt knowing it would be useless
as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boolooroo gave a yellow disappointment
the room of the great knife was high and big and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators the cit upon
in one place at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant thrown chairs for the king and queen and six smaller but richly a poste chairs for the snubs princesses
therefore her majesty paid no attention do anyone and no one paid any attention to her
rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as corcus as the wor haughty and overbearing
morning girls so people as well as you look
control yourselves my dears replied the bloo the worst punishment i knew how to inflict on egg one this prisoners about to suffer you will see a very pretty patching my royal daughters
suppose its of bring
the captain shook his head
while you sit to thatch the first living cric we met and that was the spirit note replied the captain panting hard as he held that to one of the goat's horns
the idea of patching cap'n bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him and a more he thought of it th where he roared with laughter
they yok something liar you know suggested the captain of the gars looking from one to the other doubtfully and then nearly the same soars if he stand bo from his hi legs they'd both caught the same style of whiskers and they' both for them obstinate and dangerous so they ought to make a good patch splendid
fine cori
when this had been accomplished the boolooroo leaned over to ty a discover why the frame welled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such thing before
at once the goat gave a leap escape from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the boolooroo
before an hey could stop him he bed his majesty so furiously that the king sorts far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay moaning and groaning
the goat's warlike spirit was roused by the successful attack
then they sped in great haste for the door and the go gave a final butt this s the row of royal ladies all dieting into the corridor in another tangle whereof they shrieked in a matter that terrified everyone of th sound of their voices
i had a notion it was you mad dees say me from the knife
id didn't shiver much being balance so tight but when ian loos ian to have test one good shiver to relieve my phelan's
coming g the bloo she said going toward the benches
so they were quite willing to obey the orders of their girl queen and in a short time the blast of trumpets and roll of drums and clashing of cymbals told trot and cap'n bill that the blue bands had assembled before the palace
then they al marched s a little way into the fields and found that the army of tinks had already formed and was advancing steadily towards them
at the head of the pinkies were git ghisizzle and button bright who had the perrot on his shoulder and there were supported by captain carle and captain tenant and rosalie the witch
when the blueskin saw git gases all they raised another great shout for he was the favourite of the soldiers and very popular with all the people
since last thursday i ghip ghisizzle have been the lawful boolooroo of the blue country but now that you are conquered by queen trot i suppose i am conquer too and you have no boolooroo at all
when he fished she said cheerfully
don't worry says o' dear e all come ry pretty soon
now then let's enter the city and enjoyed the great feast its being cooked i nearly star myself for this conquering kingdoms is harde work
then she gave rosy back her magic green thanking the kind which for all she had done for them
you are mate replied the sailor
it will be such a satisfaction
the guards at a terrible struggle with the goat which was loose in the room and still want it to fight but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the boolooroo out of the frame who was tied in and brought both him and the goat before queen trot who awaited them in the thrown room of the palace
i'll gladly do that promised them boolooroo and i'll feed the honourable goat all the shavings and leather in tin cans gan eat besides the grass
excuse me said shot i neglect tell you that you're not the boolooroo any more
the former boolooroo ground
i'll not be wicked anymore sighed the old boolooroo o' reform
as a private citizen i shall be a model of deportment because it would be dangerous to be otherwise
when first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever but the blues who were a simple they all laughed at them endeared them for there was not a single person in all the bu country he loved the princesses the least little bit
so ghip ghisizzle ordered the captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home
that evening trot gave a grand ball in the palace to which the most important of the pinkies and the blueskins were em biting
the combine bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served
brighter than early dawns most brilliant dye our blown clear bands of color through the sky that swirl and sweep and meat to break and foam like rainbows veils upon a bubbles dome
guided by you how we might stroll towards stiff our only music one another's breath through gardens intimate with hollyhocks where a silent poppies burned between the rocks by pools where birches been to confidants above green waters scum with a lily plans
venice
in a sunset glowing of crimson and gold she lies the glory of the world a beached king's galley whose sales are furled he was hung with tapestries rich and old
the pity that we must come and go
while the old gold and the marble days forever gleaming is soft strong blaze calm in early evening glow
the pleasant graveyard of my soul with sentimental cyprus trees and flowers is filled that i m stroll and meditation at my ease
it is my heart hung in the sky and no clouds ever float between the grave flowers and my heart on high
over the track lined city street the young men the grinning men pass
ho yee sails that seemed to wander in dream filled meadows say is the shore where i stand the only filled of struggle or are yee hit and batter thou thereby waves and wus as y tack over a clashing sea of watery echoes
old dances are simplified at their yearning bleached by time
he had got into her courtyard
through the black night rain he sang to her windowed bars
that was but rustling of dripping plants in the dark
she was alone that night
he had broken into her courtyards
to fad away like morning beauty from her mortal day down by the river of a dana her soft voices heard and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dewe
o life of this are spring
why fades the lotus of the water
why fate these children of the springing
fell is like a watery bow and like a parting cloud like a reflection in a glass like shadows in the water like dreams of infants like a smile upon it infants face
like the dell's voice like transient day like music in the air aw
and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gently hear the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time
the lily of the valley breathing in the humble grass answered the lovely we maid and said i am a watcher weeded and i am very small and loved to dwell in lowly veils so weak the gilded butterfly scarce purchase on my head yet i am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all walks in the valley and each morn over me spreads his hand saying rejoice thou humble grants thou newborn gilly flower
thou gentle mid of silent valleys and of modest brooks for thouth shall be clothed in light and fed with morning manna till summers heat mounts thee beside the fountains and the springs to flourish in eternal veils they why should fell can plain
why should the mistress of the veils of far utter a sigh
she ceased and smiled in tears then sat down in her silvers shrine
which thou dust scatter on every little blade of grass that springs revives the milked cow and tames the fire breathing steed
but fell is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun i vanish from my pearly thrown and who shall find my place
and why its scatters its bright beauti through the human air
descend a little cloud and hovered before the eyes of fell
o little cloud the virgin said i charge thee to tell me why thou complain iss now when in one hour thou fate away then we shall seek thee but not finde ah fell is like to thee
i pass away yet i complain and no one hears my voice
the cloud then showed his golden head and his bright form emerged
and fierce thou because i vanish and am seem no more
it is too ten full life to love to peace and raptures wholly unseen descending way my light wings upon baby flowers and court the fair i do to take me to her shining tent the weeping virgin trembling meals before the risen sun
till we arise linked and a golden band never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flour
lives not alone nor of itself fear not and i will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice
come forth warme and the silent valley to thy pensive queen
the helpless worm a rose and sat upon the lily's leaf and the bride clouds sail on to find his partner in the veil
image of weakness art thou but a worm
i see they way helpless than naked weeping and none to answer none to cherish thee with mother's smiles
and says thou mother of my children i have loved thee and i have given thee a crown that none can take away
and lay me down in i cold bed and leave my shining lot
or an eye of gifts and graces showering fruits and pointed gold
why a tongue impressed with honey from every wind
why an ear a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in
alway sein out a word
i sit ben thy looks as children do in the noon sun with souls that tremble through their happy eyelids from an una bred yet chronicle inward joy
i did not wrong myself so but i placed a wrong on thee
when called before i told how hastily i dropped my flowers or break off from a game
shall i never miss home talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each in turn nor counted strange when i look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this
alas i have grieved so i am hard to love
opened thy heart wide and fold within the wet wings of thy dove
could it mean to last a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow
nay i rather thrilled distrusting every light that seemed to gil be onwards path and fear to overman a finger even
and though i have grown serene and strong since then i think that god his willed a still renew able fear
oh love oh trots
and love the faults
if he to keep one oath must lose one joy by his life's star f toe
slow to world greetings quick with its o list when the angel speak
a ringing of amethyst i could not wear here plainer to my sight than that first kiss
that was the chrism of love which love's own crown with sank to finding sweetness did proceeded the third upon my lips was folded down in perfect purple state since when indeed i have been proud and said my love my own
dearest teach me so to pour out gratitude as thou dust good
mussulmans and guys though courts at a smile and have no ruth for any weeping
but thou art not such a lover my beloved
thou canst wait through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch and think it soon when others cry too late
i think all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine
oh to shoot my souls full meaning into future years that they should lend it utterance and salute love at endures from life that disappears
then i long tried by natural olds received the comfort fast while butting at thy sight my pilgrims staff gave out green leaves with morning dees empearled
i love thee freely as men strive for right i lovee purely as they turn from praises
i love thee with the passion put to use in my old greeds and with my childhood's faith
i love thee with a love i seemed to lose with my lost saints i love thee with the breath smile tears of all my life and if god choose i show but love thee better after death
