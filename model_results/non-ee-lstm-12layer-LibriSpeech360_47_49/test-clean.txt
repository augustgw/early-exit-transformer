test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tail at a point after it had in a manner a gum
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he had for his own town residence of big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in essex that he wished to immediately to proceeded

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i don't an pris pate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was young untried nervous it was a vision of serious duties and little company of really great loneliness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes but that's just the beauty of her passion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was the beauty of it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it's sound a dull that sounded strange and all the mor so because of his main condition which was
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but was that all her rewards one of the ladies asked
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that through its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this childs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely childs whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yet these thoughts affected hester prynne less with hope than apprehension
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the childs had a native grace which does not invariably co exist with faultless beauty it's attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garbed that precisely became it best
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this outwards mutability indicated and did not more than fairly expressed the various properties of her inner life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hester could only account for the child's character and even then most meagrely and imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that moment is period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hester prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one childs ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that rolled the moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits but hester could not have questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human childs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the childs to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has evoked the spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pearl was borne outcast of the infantile world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if spoken too she would not speak again
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hester pron wet one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state bor though the chances of a popular election had caused the former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter publick interests and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with a deliberations of legislators and acts of state
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only cause a fierce and bitter contests in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the frame work itself of the legislature
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have spoken of pearls rich and luxuriant beauty a beauty that shown with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depths and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the mother herself as if the redd ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only and consequence of that identity had hester contrive so perfectly to represent the scar at letter in her appearance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: come therefore and let us spling met at them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but pearl who was a dauntless childs after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were latticed windows the wooden shutters to close over them that need

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentleman of fairest state in his native land
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on the table and token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind stood a large pewter tankard at the bottom of which a hester or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draft of ale
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering fronts piece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breast plate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mother cried she i see you here look look
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the proprietor appeared already to have re relinquished as hopeless the aport to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mister blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that half mythological personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a ball
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pearl seeing the rose bushes began to cry for her red rose and would not be pacified

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the foot of the mountain separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the glance the path divided
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbour
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unc and ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of doctor piped
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: uncocked at the door of the house and a chubby pleasant faced woman dressed all them blew opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you must know said margolotte when they were all seated together on the broad windows seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mamy the witch who used to leave in the country of the kill cans to the north of here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the first lot we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think the next glass cap and magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and they prove of some us to us
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am afraid i don't know much you ab the lay and device
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you see i lived all my life without monkey the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that is one reason you are ojo the unlucky said the woman in sympathetic tone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think i must show you my patchwork girl said marvel laughing at the boy's astonishment as she is rather difficult to explain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but first i will tell you that from many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cop the meals and wash the dishes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and colors of cloth all neatly so together
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sometimes it is call a crazy quilt because the patches and colours are so mixed upo
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when i found it i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from tying to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the emerald city where our princess ozma lives green is the popular color
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ojo examined this curious contrivance with wonder
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: margolotte had first made the girl's form from the patchwork quilted and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same gay material throughout
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her necking several neat braids
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: gold is the most common metal in the land of oz and is used from many purposes because it is soft and pliable
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no i forgot on the bout and brains exclaimed the woman
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well that may be true agreed margolotte but on the contrary a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in the servant
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she ran to her husbands side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: their contents said all boiled away leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it al together in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ojo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he selected a small gold bottle with a pepper box top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any objects through the small holes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: most people talk too much so it is a relief to find one who talks too little
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i not allowed to reform magic except for my own amusement he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe where the cookin stem and began to smoke
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wit of oz who used to be a humbug and knew no magic at all has been taking lessons of glinda and i told he is getting to be a pretty good wizards but he is nearly the assistant of the great sorceress
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it truly is asserted the magician
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know use them as ornamental statuary in my garden
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: dear me one a chanter box are getting to be un remarked the magician who was pleased with the compliment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: asked the voice in scornful accents

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the edict of milan the great charter of toleration had confirmed to each individual of the roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but this inestimable privilege was soon violated with a knowledge of truth the emperor ebb the maxims of persecution and the sex which dissented from the catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of christianity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: constantine easily believed that the heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some of the penal regulations were copied from the edith's of diocletian and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who would felt the hand of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they asserted with confidence and almost with exultation that the apostolical succession was interrupted that all the bishops of europe and asia were infected by the cantation of guilt in schism and that the prerogatives of the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the african believers who alone had preserved in violet the integrity of their faith and discipline
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: bishops virgins and even spotless infants were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance before they could be admitted to the communion of the dom iss

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: since the period of our tale the active spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements though none but the hunter or the savage is ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had dispersed the mists and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest when the travellers resumed their journey
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: after proceeding a few miles the progressive hawkeye who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross i rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinions of ching get goo were frequent and earnest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yet here are we within a short range of the skins and not a sign of a trail have we crossed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: let us retrace our steps and examine as we go with keener eyes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ching gutch cook had caught the look and motioning with his hand he bade him speak
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: see said uncas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone towards the forest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if a rock or rivulet or a bit of earth harder than common severed the links of the clew they followed the true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: extinguished brands were lying around a spring the awful of a deer were scattered about the place and the trees bore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a circle of a few hundred feet and circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the examination however resulted in no discovery
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the whole party crowded to the spot where uncas pointed out the impressions of a moccasin in the moist de alluvium
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: run back uncas and bring me the size of the singer's foot
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: notwithstanding the high resolution of hawkeye he fully comprehended all the difficulties in danger he was about to incur
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in his return to the camp his acute and practised intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of balum's asked to speak he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bere singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was something in his air and the manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the ingenious hawk eye who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well known voice replied
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the truth began to dawn upon him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: come come returned hawk eye un casing his honestest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companions you may see a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to ith that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the young man is in bondage and much i fear his death is decreed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i greatly mourned that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and i have sought a goodly him can you lead me to him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the task will not be difficult return david hesitating though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase that mitigate his unhappy fortunes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very center of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for or fit the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas weary but close observers of the manner of their captive
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: delivered in a strong tone of ascent announced the gratification the savage would receive and witnessing such an exhibition of weakness and an enemy so long hated and so much feared
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the bare instead able ban maintain the seat it had taken and growled
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hint he received they must stand further off
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful wits
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and the singer as as good as nothing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the delawares are children of the tortoise and they outstripped the deer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: uncas who had already approached the door in readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but hawkeye who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himselfe to his companion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so uncas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well what can't be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little metal that so direct and attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgot in my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if you are not then knocked on the head your being anon composer will protect you and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: situ for yourself to make a rush or terry here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: bravely and generously as he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practise myself as one without across a blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: god bless you friend i do believe your sent has not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of temptation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features is he afraid
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will the herons here his groans
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mohican started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he had though occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: unc u cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i will endeavor in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clears something very unusual had occurred
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: without his scrap books his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was absent mother more than an hour
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the only du poo at which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honest is absolutely above suspicion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the moment i looked at my table i was aware that some one had rummaged among my papers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed into cable i mad a most careful in sil of the room
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a broken tip of lead was lying there also
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: above all things i desired to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to the bestest of my belief they were rolled up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door open
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so it seems to me

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am afraid there are no signs here said he
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one could hardly hope for anny upon so dry a day

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was hoping that if the paper i which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polish surface no i see nothing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as holmes drew the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and in alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hm turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor hello what is this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: homes how it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then of a sudden at midday the sun shot out hot and still no breath of air stirred the sky was like blue steel the earth steam
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where was the use of imagining
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the lagoon had been level with the dikes a wee togo and now
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he splashed a stepped along farther and farther onwards until he near the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then he looked down the lagoon was dry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green fifth tall wet and willowy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the squares of cotton sharp edged heavy would just about to burst to bowls
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a one long moment he paused stupid a gate with utter amazement van lean dizzily against a tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he gazed a about p flexed astonished
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work in pain someone had feather can now from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by long and cooked way thus allowing it to empty directly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost sola
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the years of the days of her dying were ten
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: up in the sick room o'er lay on the little white bed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the that and weave of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that stroll for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: f while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure it son and bird and tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she rose where the fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forwards wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she had been borne within its porters within his boor she had lived and groan and within its border she had met her love
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island low the cotton lay before her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the chair was empty when he knew
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he darted through the trees and posted a tall man strongly but slimy made
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is very hin old place of red brick softened by a pale powdery lichen which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables the binds and the door place
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the windows are patched with wooden pains and the door i think is like the gate it is never opened
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shedding with a sonorous bang behind the livery lackey who had just seen his master and mist off the grounds in a carriage and pair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a large open fireplace with rusty dogs in it and a bearer boarded floor at the far end places of wolves stacked up in the middle of the floor some empty corn bags
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and what through the left hand windows
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: several close horses a pillion a spinning wheel and an old box wide open and stuff ful of colored rags
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the edge of this box there lies a great wooden dull which so far as mutilation is concerned bears a strong resemblance to the finest greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the history of the house is plain now
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but there is always as stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beans and making sparkles among the wet straw and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cow shed and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow build ducks nore seizing the opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it as possible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: were the great barn doors are thrown wide open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendents of mister guy the wid otherwise saddler who entertains them with a latest treadles and gossip
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: heavy sorrel often took the opportunity when her aunt's back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished services for the oak table was usually turned up like a screen and was more for ornament than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round petter dishes there were ranged on the shelves above the long deal dinner table or in the hobbs of the great which always shone like jasper
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do not suppose however that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance she was a good looking woman not more than eight and thirty a fair complexion and sandy hair well shapen like footed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the v like between her and her niece dynamic with a contrast between her keenness and dinas sirrah gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a martha and mary
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a damsel came with air shot seemed to take up an unfinished lecture as a barrel organ takes up a tune precisely at the point where it had left off
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the widows and why consequently missus poyser should scold molly the housemaid with unusual severity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: towel appearance molly had got through her after inner work in an exemplary manner had cleaned herself with great dispatch and now came to asks submissively if she should sit down to her spinning till milking time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: spinning indeed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i never knew your equals for galls ness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: who taught you to scrub up floor i should like to know
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: come the wool for the wid os indeed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's we she'd like to be doing is it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's the way with you that's the road you'd all like to go head longs to ruin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister le's indeed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you are rare per sitting down to your work a little while after its time to put by
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: money mons trite told these put it down to wm
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cold is it my darling bless your sweet face
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she's going to put the ironing things away
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: money i did lie to do into the barn to tommy to see the wood od
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no no no totty a git her feet wet said missus poyser carrying away her ire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: did ever anybody see the like screamed missus poyser running towards the table when her eye had fallen on the blue stream
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: toady however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run and in amount of fat on the neighbor per neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and she was very found of view two aunt rachel
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: which y had that ban illness and i was only eleven year's old she used to say you'll have a friend on earth in your aunt rachel if i'm taken from you for she has a kind heart and i'm sure i've found it so
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and there's linen in the house as i could wells spare you for i got lots a sheeting and table clothing in twins isn't made up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: did not more than what's in the bible and said dinna
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nay dear aunt you never heard me say that all people are call to forsake their work in her families
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we can all be servants of god wherever our lot is cast but he gives us different sorts of work according as he fits us for it and calls us to it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can no more helps spending my life in trying to do what i can for the souls of others then you could help running if you heard little totty crying at the other end of the house the voice would go to your heart you would think the dear childs in trouble or in danger and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i've strong assurance that no evil will happen you and my uncle and the children for from anything i've done
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i didn't preach without direction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: direction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had a common patience with you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and had got down from their horses it was plain they meant to come in
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: said mister berwin with this stately cordiality
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh ser don't mention it said missus poyser
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i delight in your kitchen
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: poison is not at home missie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: said captain done horn sitting himselfe where he could see along the short passage to the open darr door
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no sir he isn't he's gone to rossiter to see mister west the factor about the wool
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but there's father and barn sir if he'd be of any use
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no thank you i'll just look at the whelps and leave a message about them with your shepherd
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i must come another day and see your husband i want you to have a consultation with him about horses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for if is anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh sir said missus poyser rather alarmed you wouldn't like it at all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but you know more about that than i do sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think i should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i knows farm is in better order than any other within ten miles of us and as for the kitchen he added smiling i don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by the by i've never see your dairy it must seer daring missus poyser
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this missus poyser said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her mote pans and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh i've no doubt it's in capital order
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the paris planned like that of the crystal palace was a temporary exhibit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the london plant was last temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings and the vicinity of whole barn ba
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there mess y's johnson and hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the dynamo electric machine though small was robust for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine seventeen years
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why if we erect station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there seems no good reasoned for believing that it will change
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: broad as the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them he is idiocy chronically opposed to loose and wasteful methods to plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against its seriously
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could a charge stage batteries all of which are easily with am ability of the direct current
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a farm mouse the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and his ideal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy and nothing would satisfy him that couldn stand cross examination by microscope test tube and galvanometer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governed regulated than those available for his dynamo and lamp edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give us steady light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister edison was a leader far had of the time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he obtained the desired speeded and lowe with a friction break also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator to verify it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then again there was no known way to lubricate and engine for continuous running and madison in formed me that as a renee engine started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so in engine for his purposes must produce light at all times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: edison had install his his start first great central station system in new york on the multi able arc system covered by his feeder and maine invention which resulted in unable saving in the cost of conductors as against a strait two wire system throughout of the tree kind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact district of large cities
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the strong position held by the edison system under this strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate epic to incandescent lighting
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was specially suited for a trial plat also in the early days when a yielded six or eight lamps to the horse bower was consider subject for congratulation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the street conductors were of the overhead whole line construction and were in stalled by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build an equip central stations
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wi system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent in bents at practically the same time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think he was perhaps more appreciative than i was of the discipline of the edison construction to pardon and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning the fourth before we started up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were later used as reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of eis sonia but they remained i practically as good condition as one installed in eighteen eighty three
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the ark lamp in stalled outside a customers premises or in a circuit for publick street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many knights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: edison held that the electricity sold must be measure just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was infinite skepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject bere thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or wade and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact pointed use could not be brought to accurate registration
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hence the edison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the principle employed in the edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit aft of current or damage
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the standard edison mither practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company's another set being substituted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in december eighteen eighty ape mister de j jenks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the others having been in operation to short at time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this connection it should be mentioned that the associations of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison meter was accurate and at its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station sum and current by meter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nin and probably up to the close of the century
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he weighed and re wade the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the problem was salt
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we had neither is in which there were two bottles of liquid
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: here she would stay comforted en soothed among the lovely plants and rig exotics rejoicing the heart of old turn at a gardener who since polly's first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous ams of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then dear said missus whitney you must be kind to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear at no longer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if she could only see phronsie for just one moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh she's always at the piano said man she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at this the bundle open suddenly and out popped phronsie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but polly couldn't speak and of jasper hadn't caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool phronsie and all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: asked phronsie with her little face close to polly's own
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now you'll stay cried man say polly mote you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh you are the dearest and best mister king i ever saw but how did you make mammy let are come
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: isn't he splendid cried jasper an intense pride swelling up father knew how to do it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there there he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know gasped polly controlling her sobs i won't only i can't think you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: asked phronsie in intense interest slipping down of polly's arms and crowding up close to jasper side
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he didn now truly phronsie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh no japs sor i must go by my very own self
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: bear jap you've caught it laughed percy while the others screamed the side of jasper's face
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: don't mind it polly whisper jasper twasn't her fault
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: dear me ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost amazement and such a time as i've had to get her here too
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how did her mother ever let her go
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she asked impulsively i didn't believe you could persuade her father
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i didn't have any fears if i worked to rightly said the old gentleman complacently
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he cried in high dudgeon just as if he owned the hole of the peppers and could dispose at them all to suit his fancy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space at time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is sixteen years since john berks and died
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his wife now lies beside him and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checker board marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gaily painted farmhouses the gilded weather veins on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the heir and the earth are are curiously mad it and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's not much of a job for an athlete here i've been to town and back
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at exam her that you sleep late
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she gathered up her reins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: please wait for mem marie anal cox
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i never see lose sighed over here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how brown you've got since you came home i wish i had an added le to m my orchard
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i get wet to my knees when i go down to pick cherries
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: indeedy he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they think your proud because you've been away to school or something
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual grimness and care for detail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on either side of the road for a mile before he reached the foot of the hill stood tall o sage oran hedges their glossy green mocking off the yellow fields
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: any one thereabout would have told you that this was one of her richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra burgs in
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is even a white throw of bee hives and the orchard under the walnut trees
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: frank read english slowly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he grew
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: marie sighed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a brisk wind had come up and was driving puppy white clouds across the sky
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that invitation decided her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh but i'm glad to get this place mode
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: just smell the wild roses they are always so spicy after a rain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we never had so many of them men here before
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i suppose it's the wet season will you have to cut them too
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i suppose that's the light decent two of them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it exciting to see everything growing till fast and to get the grass god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: aren't you splashed look at the spider lips all over the grass
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pale and he began to swinging his sigh with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learn
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: lari picked cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering ranch after another shivering when she thought a shower of raindrops on her neck and hair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: an amyl mode his way slowly down toward the jerry trees
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that summer the reins had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than chivato and his man could do to keep up with the core the orchard was a neglected wilderness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i don't know all of them but i know bind nance are
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if i feel that way i feel that way
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he reached up among the branches and began to pick with sweet insipid fruit long ivory colored berries tipped with maine pink like white coral that fall to the brown unheeded all summer through
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he dropped a handful into her lap
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes don't v
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh ever so much only you seems kind of stay at and school teacher
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when she used to tell me about him but always wondered whether she wasn't come little l love with him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it would serve you all right if she walked dot with karl
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i life to talked to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh amyl
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: surely you are not thinking of going off there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mary's face fou under his brooding gaze
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm sure i but send your hope you will stay on here she murmured
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i don't let stand around them look on
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i want to be doing something on my own account
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sometimes i don't want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the four corners of the divide together he threw out his arms and brought it bat with a jerk so like good tablecloth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i get tired of seeing man and horses going up and down up and down
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wish she weren't so restless and didn't get so worked up over things she said sadly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thank you he returned shortly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and you never used to be crossed me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can't play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly that's what you miss marie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but amal if i understand then are good times are over we can never do nice things together any more
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and anyhow there is nothing to understand
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that won last it will go away and things will be just as they us too
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i pray for you but that's not the same as if you pray yourself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can't pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i won't pray not have them not if i damned for it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then all our good dimes far over
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: saturday august fifteenth the sea and broken all round no land in sight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the horizon seems extremely distant
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: all my danger and sufferings or needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am well his nature has resumed its sway
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye axes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one might be would less reason than now
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am not com plaining that the rate is slow but that the seat is so wide
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we are is in time and the fact is i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon pon on a raft
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he called to sea o upon and i long v wage taking a little sail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i take this is my answer and i leave the professor d bite his lips with impatience
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sunday august sixteenth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nothing new whether unchanged the wind freshens
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but there seemed no reason of fear
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the shadow of the wrath was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: truly the sea is of infinite width
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it must be as wide as the mediterranean or they atlantic and why night
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: these thoughts agitated me all day and my imagination scarcely calm down after several hour sleeve
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i shudder as i recall these monsters to my remembrance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i saw a de hamburg knees in the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i suppose professor leaden brock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pick his eyes travers the ocean from side to side
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: tuesday august eighteen
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: daring his watch i slept
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there's a wail aware cried the professor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they weeded around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of expressed rates
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: two monster's only re creating all this commotion and be for my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i could distinguish the eye of ida sic glowing like a bad hot co and as large as a man's head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: its jaw is enormous and according naturalists it is ard with no less than one hundreds and eighty two teeth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: those huge creatures attack each other with the greatest animosity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: suddenly the idiotic and the plus source disappear below leaving war pool eddy in the water
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as for the if the assures as he returned to submarine cavern
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wings become lost in the distance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the weather if we may use the tern will change before law
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the atmosphere is charged with vapors pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of sailing waters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the electric light can scarcely penetrate to the dense curtain which is dropped over the theater on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the air is heavy the sea is calm
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from time time a fleecy tuft of mists would yet some gleaming light left upon it drums down upon the dense floor of grey and loses itself in the opake an impenetrable mass
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the atmosphere as evidently charged and surcharged with electricity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wind never lulls but to acquire increase strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there's a heavy storm coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on the mast already i see the light play of lammed saint ivo's fire the outstrip sill catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lad
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but if we have now cease to advance why do weet leave that sail loose which at the first shock of a tempest may capsize us in a moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that will be the safest no no never
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the piled up vapours contents in the water and the air put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mist rouses itself into a world when
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hon stairs night
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the under surface of the clouds there are continual missions of lurid light electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules the gashes elements of the air ne to be slaked with moisture for innumerable columns of water rushed upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i referred to the thermometer it indicates the figure is obliterated
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: is the atmosphere conditioning having once reached density to become final
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the raft bears ar still to the south east
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at noons the valence of the storm redoubled
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: each of us is lashed to some part of the raft
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the waves rise above our heads
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they send to be we are lost but i am not sure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a nods his consent
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the farre ball half of it wide half user blue and the size of attent inch shill moved soul it about the raft but revolving on its own axis for astonishing velocity as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: here comes there it glides now it is up the ragged stump of the mast that's it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just skimmed the powder magazine horrible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches hans who fixes his blue eye upon its steadily it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoided
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a suffocating smell of nin tat had fills the air it enters the throat it fills the lungs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we suffer stifling pains
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and how odd the directions will look
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: poor alice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed the pair white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan and the other he can trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh won't she be savage if i've kept her waiting
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: alice to up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is today
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and yesterday thinks went on just as usual
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wer if i've been changed in the night
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i almost think i can remember feeling a little different
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'll try if i know all the things i used to know
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i shall never get to twenty at that rate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no i've made it my mind about it if i'm mabel i'll stay down here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it'll be no use there' putting their heads down and saying come up again dear
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm so very tired of being all alone here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: an i declare it's too bad that it is
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wish i hadn't cried so much said alice as she swim about trying to find her way out
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that will be a queer thing for to beast sure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am very tired to swimming about here oh mouse
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cried alice again for this time the mouth was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we won't talk about her any more if he'd rather not we indeedy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the condition is that i will be permitted to make lute or talk american stream on him so to speak because you'll never get people whether in or outside the luther in church actually to read luther unless we make him talk as he would talk to day to americans
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: let us begin with that his commentary undulations
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the undertaking which seems so attractive when viewed as a literary tasks proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was written and latin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the word had to be convinced
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a word should now be said about the origin of luther's commentary and relations
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: much later when a friend of his was preparing addition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine m delians for instance and
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther addressed distance and the course of gallian and rara prepared the manuscript for the printer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it presents like no other of luther's writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christ's merits alone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the essence of luther's lectures is there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the lord has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do luke two
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the word of our god shall stand forever
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint paul
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they said to the glens you have no right to think highly of paul
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was the last to turn to christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pawing waiter in his beneath us
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do you suppose that god for the sake of a few lutheran heretics would this own his entire church
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: against these boasting false apostles paul boldly defend his apostolic authority and ministry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as the ambassador of a government is honoured for his office and not for his private person so the minister of cries should exalt his office in order to gain authority among m
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: paul takes pride in his ministry not to his own phrase but to the praise of god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: paul and apostle not of men et cetera
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: either he calls ministers though the agency of men or he cuss them directly as he called the prophets in apostles
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: paul declares that the false apostles were call their scent neither by men nor by man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the most they could claim as that there were sent by others
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the call is not to be taken lightly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for person the possess knowledge is not enough
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: is spoils one's best work
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his coal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because were taught so pry instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this is no sinful pride it is holy pride
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in god the father who raised him from the dead
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the clawing superfluous on first sight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: these perverse of the rightness of christ resists the father and the sun and the works of them both
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this whole epistle pul treats of the resurrection of christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by his resurrection christ w the victory over law sin flesh world devil death hell and every evil
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: first two
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and all the brethren which are with me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this should go far and shutting the mouths of the fal poses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: although the brethren with me near not apostles like myself yet they all of one mind with me think right and teach as i do
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they do not go with the enemies of the gospel predominate they over the christians are
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why do they not invade the catholic provinces and preached their doctrine to godless princes bishops and doctors as we have done by the help of god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we look for that rewards which i hath not seen nor ear heard neither hat entered into the heart of man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not all the glens had become perverted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: these means cannot be contaminate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they remained divine regardless of mens opinion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church even though ante chris rings there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the apostle verse three
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: grace be too you in peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the terms of grace and peace are common terns with paul and are now pretty well understood
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the greeting of the apostle is refreshing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: grace involves the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the world brands this a pernicious doctrine
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: experience profess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: however the grace and piece of god will
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: men should not speculate about the nature of god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: was it not enough to say from god the father
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to do so as to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure into comprehend his infinite majesty
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: embrace him and forget about the nature of god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: did not christ himself say i am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when you argue about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we are to hear christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at sin time paul confirms are creaked that christ is very god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that christ is very god is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to this spens grace and peace
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to bestow peace and grace lies in the province of god who alone c create these blessings the angels cannot
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and peace from our lord jesus christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the arians took cries for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mohammed also speedily of christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pauli to est
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he never los his sight of the purpose of his epistle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not gold or silver or pascal lambs or in angel but himself what for
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not for a crown or a kingdom or a goodness before sins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: under score these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how may we obtain remission of our sins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: poysers the man who is named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our sinse
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason but they cannot be put away by our own efforts
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this sentence also to finds our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single soon
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the greatness of the ransom christ son of god indicates this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the vicious character of sin is brought out by the word who gave himself for our sins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but we are careless we make light of sin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we think that by some little work or marit we can dismissed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this passage then there is out the fact that all man or soldier sin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conceptions that sin as a small matter easily tak him care of by good works but we must present ourselves e to god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before may feel that christ was given for our sense
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on the other hand we are not to regard them is so terrible that we must despair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he passes abruptly from persons the ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to men from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subjects and object first and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flats of sense
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the influence which the teas has exercised upon p sterry is due hart lure misunderstanding
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this supposed depths of this dial of the meal platonists found hidden meanings in connexions with the jewish and christian skaters and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with this sperit of plato
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were absorbed in his theology and where other the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly corrector sicken him his effort realize in connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there iss danger of the modern commentators of it tobe s falling unto the absurdities of the neo plat mists
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the present day we are well a weir that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the fancy of the neal platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit of phase of the human mind which reviled widely in the first centuries of the christian ea and is not wholly extinct in our own day
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spit they are opposed to him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we do not know how plata would have arranged his u dialogs or whether de thought of arranging any of them besides the te tilities which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the dialogs is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this tour the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but he has not as yet be find this intermediate territory which like somewhere between medicine in mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great and impiety in winking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with rates he acknowledges the perpetual flux like an eager he asser the predominance of mine although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing by the fifi ins he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: many if not all the elements of the priest socratic philosophy are included in the timaeus
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is probable that the relation of the ideas of god were of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animal s birds fishes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the style and plan of the tus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but plato has not the same messy over his instrument which he exhibits in the features or supposing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nothing can exceed the beauty or art of introduction in which his using words after his accustomed manner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he could writ in one's style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet in fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the tenor of plato which characterizes to philosophical poor of lucretius
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs and plato is earlier writings
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work art
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so wades begins to teens with a summary of the republic
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and now he desires to see the ideal state set in motion he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and therefore to you i turn to me as citizen of locris whar at once a philosopher in a statesmen and to you prettiest whome all athenians know to be similarly accomplished and to her mo pities who also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i will if tee as a proves i approve
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: listen then so praties to a tail of sullens who being the friend of trise my great grandfather toted to my grandfather cities and he told me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some poems of solemn were recited by the boys
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in what was the subject of the polar said the persons will may the remark
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the subject was a very noble one he described the most famous actions in which the athenian people were ever engaged
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the memory of their exploits have passed away owing to the laps of time and the extinction of the actors
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: tell us said the other the whole story and where sole and heard this story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registry temples
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the genealogies which you have re sit to us out of your own anal solon are a mere children's story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for in the times before the great flood at thing was the greatest and best of cities and dad that noblest deeds and had the best constitution of any under the face of heavens
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: solemn marvelled and desired to be in formed of the particulars
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nine thousand years have elapsed since she founded yours and eight thousand since she found it ars as are anal to record
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: many laws exist among this us which i a counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i will briefly describe them to you and it shall lead the account of them as your leisure in the sacred gestures
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: observe again what cared law tuk in the pursuit of wisdom searching out the dee things of the world and applying them to the use of men
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the most famous of them all was the overthrew of the island of a plantes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for at the peril of her all existence and when the other helen had deserted her she repelled invader and of her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within thee pillars
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this is the exclamation of the shallows which are foul in that part of the attentive ocean
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but i would not speak at a time because i wanted to refresh lan memory
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first tene was a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of men and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost athenian citizens of from the egyptian records spoke
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: bet already at pointed economic evolution far eating the emergence of the lady specialized consumption of a goods as an in evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a mor oral less elaborate system
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the utility of consumption as in evidence of wealth is to be classed as a dervish of growth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: such consumption h for to the women is nearly incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labour and not the conception erected to their own comfort and full ass of life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with a further advance and counter this t be may changed into simple custom of a mor or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be at a bu or larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisured class
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: under the tabu certain victuals and mop pic clearly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior cass
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: crankiness and the other pathological consequences of the free yews of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become unorthodox of the superior staters of those who are able to afford the indulgence
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a conception directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the muster
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with many qualifications it more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradual awakened the general rue is fell to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their mass
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's stresses and household paraphernalia is an up thei exception to this rue but it will appear in the sequel that this exceptions is much more obvious and substantial
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of con mi alloy and religion these monies are also present in the later development that they not countin it to be the sol motus
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is a moralist elaborate system of rank and grates
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this differentiation is further by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are the same time les of substance in their own right so that some of them must scar let all others only partially to be rated as my carries consumers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so many of them however h make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as thy curious consumer without qualification
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: many of these again and also many of the others or price of lest degree having turn attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive group of by carr is consume in the persons of their wife's and children their servants retainers etc cetera
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wearing of uniforms a liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even b said to be a mark of servitude real or o sensible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wearers of uniforms in liberates may be rat divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so those of this is which are by wight the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the car of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be class as ostensibly predatory employments
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: whenever as in these cases the menial serves in question has to directly with a primly leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires are effected horrific characters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the livery becomes obnoxious to mean the old who are required to wear it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in a general way though not whole in all consistently these two groups callin sight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the dependant who u first delegate for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in later developed of the institution when the member of persons by whom these dues are customarily performed gradual narrows the wife remains the last
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the jutes of o carr leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the communities of the weston culture this point is a present found among the lower mid of class
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if beauty comfort is achieved and it is mor less for chute is circumstance a fair they must be achieved by means and methods that comme themselves to the great economic law of voiced effort
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeedy commonly does that with a still lower dissent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slams the man and presently also the children virtually ceased to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sol exponent of the households pecuniary decency
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decencies put away
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is no class and no country that as yielded so object before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual neet
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a questionest which of the two methods were most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desire to effect
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: each will therefore serve about equally well ding the earner stated of social growth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is also noticeable that the sorts c ability consumptions a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individually widest and the mobility of the populations is greatest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: consumptions becomes large element in the standard of living in the city u in the country
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: among the country population its places to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighbor gossip sufficiently d serve the life general purpose of pecuniary repute
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the result is a great nobility of the labor employed in printing paps greater than in any other equally well define in considerable body of workmen
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: under the simple pestle effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary elation pretty evenly between them at the outset
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came to all the rank farram above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the coarse i peaceful culture
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: are the circumstance permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and almost ever is of human news
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: o reconciliation between the two convicting were quiets is affected by resort to make believe man an intricate polite o servants as and social duties a ceremonial nature are developed many organization s founded with some specious object of emil ration and boded in their official stent ty flees there is much coming in going and a deal of talk to the end that the talk is may not t occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the silent features of these development of domestic services have al it been indicated
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: throughout the entire revolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or of services or human life rents the obvious invocation that in order to effectually men the consume is good thing it must be expenditure of superfluities
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as use in a speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends salt by consumer under this cannon of conic waste
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but it is another grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterize are wasteful
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in strict accuracy nothing should be flooded under the head of conspicuous waste at such expenditure as incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and ar to c lady useful and wasteful both and it ceti to consumer mad be made up of us and waste in the most varying proportions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and often has my mother said while on her lap i laid my head she feared for time i was not made but for eternity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why are we to be denied each others society
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why are we to be divided
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: surely it must be because we're in danger of loving each other too well of losing sight of the creator an idolatry of the creature
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we is to dispute about politics in religion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she aryan clergyman's daughter was always in a minority of one in our house of violent dissent in radicalism
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her feeble health if her her yielding manner for she could never oppose anyone without gathering up all her strength for the struggle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he spoke french perfectly i have been told when need was but delighted usually in talking the broadest yorkshire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent radicals and dissenters into which twenty years ago of a little quiet resolute clergyman's daughter was received and by whom she was truly loved and honored
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: january and february of eighteen thirty seven had passed away and still there was no reply from selby
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am not depreciating it when i say that in these times it is not rare
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but it is not with of you to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you cans your own happiness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will say that a woman has no need of such a caution there can be no peril in it for her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the more she is engaged in her proper duties the last leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to those duties you have not yet been called and when you are you will be less eager for celebrity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but do not suppose that i despair the gift which you possess nor that i would discs you from exercising it i only exhort you so to think of it and so to use it as to render it conducive to your own permanent good
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: farewell madam
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: though i may be but an ungracious adviser you will allow me therefore to scribe myself with the best wishes for your happiness here and hereafter your trough friend wal bert sylvie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sir march sixteenth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i have not ventured to hope for such a reply so considerate in its tone so noble in its spirit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know the first letter i wrote you as all senseless trash from beginning to end but i have not altogether the idle dreaming being it would seem to denote

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fitzooth's hand rested at last upon the top rung of the ladder and slowly the truth came to him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: robin carefully descended the latter and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: studley was by his side in the flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape in character of his vault
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice wantons
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: save the masters but you startled me rarely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cried he waving the lantern before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he did not thinking of the warms sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cotta children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but this was what the tree couldn bear to hear
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hair would often come leaping along and jumped right over a little tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: o that made him so angry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to grow and grow to get on and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most might ful thing in the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in autumn the woodcutters always came and felled some of the largest trees
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this happened every year and the young fir tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight for the magnificence great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and beare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were lid in carts and the horses dragged of them out of the wood
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: have you not met them anyone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: rejoys and thy growth said the sunbeams
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and then what happens then
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i would fay now if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: were i but already on the cart
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where i in the warn room with all the splendor and magnificence

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with choice in our presence so the air and the sunlight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: rejoice in my own fresh youth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter in summer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the axe struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pangs like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful that being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the departure was not at all agreeable
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the tre on he came to himself when he was unloaded in a court yard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we donned want the others
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there two were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture books and full of toys were hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the children said so
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this evening they all said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how it will shine this evening
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: perhaps the other trees from the forests will come to look git me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it blazed up famously help help
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cried the young ladies and they quickly putt out the fire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a story

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but i shall tell only one story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how be dont be fell downstairs and yet he married the princess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's the way of the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thought the fir tree and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i won't tremble to morrow thought the fir tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and whole night the tree stoodst still and in deep thought
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the morning the servants and the housemaid came in
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but they dragged him out of the room and up stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what the meaning of this thought the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: tis now a winter out of doors thought the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how kind man is after all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if don only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sleek squeak
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they snuffed about the fir tree and rustled among the branches
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am by no means old said the fir tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there's many a one considerably older than i am
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were so extremely curious
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know no such place said the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: said the fir tree thinking over what he had himself related
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes in reality those more happy times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: h is upp don't he asked the mice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: only that one answered the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is a very s stupid story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: don't you one about bacon and cello canoes canst you tell any latter stories
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no said the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then good by said the rats and they went oa
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listen to what i told them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now that too is ovver
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in loft
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and throne rather harde it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but it was not the fir tree that they meant
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the courtyards some of the married children were playing who had danced at christmas round the fir tree and were so glad at the sight of him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the gardener's boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and it side sod deeply
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: kenneth them beth refrained from telling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogers visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned who closely about the penalty for fortune a cheque
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and ton gates beg fair to serve the lengthy term in the states prison as a consequence of his rash apt
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can't see it in that light said the old lawyer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but they could not have prove in a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably a mere bluff
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was soft hearted and impetuous said beth at being a love he didn't stop to count the cost
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if the prosecution or it withdrawn and they case settled with the victim of the fort cheque then the young man would be allowed is freedom
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but under the circumstances i doubt of such an ar it could be made
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fair view was twelve miles away but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county dle

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he unlocked the door and called here's visitor's tom
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: worse tom horse and error replied the jailer cooly

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have heard something of your story said kenneth and are interested in it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and i'm glad i did it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: old well as a fine fellow but poor in helpless since missus rogers had her accident
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then rods wouldn't do anything but leader around and weighed upon her and the place went to rack in ruin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he spoke simply but paced up and down to narrow cell in friend of them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: who's name gid you sign to the check asked kenneth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concert
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it's a stop company in rich
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was bit keeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forged the signature
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved him a heavy loss one day
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed theo plant former shall never even think the
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was better for him to think the girl unfailingly to know the truth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm going to see mister marshall said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thank you sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it won't be much but un grateful to find a friend

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'll pay all the cause b sight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you're foolish why should you do all this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i have my old reason's mister marshal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: give me a check for thundering fifty had altered over to you the fort cheque and quashed further proceedings
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he detested the grasping dispiteous soon that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help the young gates
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: firth uneasy of silence nudged him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he might have had that forged check for the face of it if he'd been sharp
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so to the surprise at the democratic committee and all his friends mister hopkins announced that he would oppose forts aggressive campaign with an equals aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one of misor hopton first tasks after calling his faithful henchman around him was to make a careful countess of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the weak need contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundreds votes in one way or the other secured from an opposition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the democratic committee figured out away to do this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: under ordinary conditions rebels was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to i at hopkins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the ely thing necessary was to fix seth rena's and this hopkins arranged personally
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and this was white kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the younger woman in the buggy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the descriptions she gave of the coming reception to the women's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist an electing mister forbes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the fair view band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house or taxed to entertain the guess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty at substantial repast was to be served
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given it elmhurst and the only when within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been the invited guests

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her manner was neither independent north certain but rather one of well bred composure and calm relies
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her eyes wandered to the maid hand
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: however her features in form might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the respect pain her on all sides she seemed like a queen and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three she appeared an object of worship the queen mother gave the french the most affectionate reception france was her native country and she had suffered too much unhappiness in england for england who have made her forget friends
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she taught her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had both been hospitably received and where a brilliant future open for them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the count had throne himself back on his seat leading his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus his face buried in his hands with heating chest and restless limbs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this has indeed been a harassing day continued the young man his eyes fixed upon his friend
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will be frank with me a ow hiss a
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: can your imagine my buckingham has been so violent i suspect
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is you r m beacon row i have red as distressing his eyes in his every gesture and action the whole day

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes i me repose many things have agitated be to nay both in line and body when you returned to morrow i shall no longer be the same man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in this friendly pressure row could detect the meran agitation of a great internal conflict
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the night was clear starlit and splendid the tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life peace and security everywhere

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were subtly n near the solution of their problem
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the poor little things cried sin pia think of them having been turned to the wall all these ears

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but joyce had not eliciting all at once she put on her candle on the table and faced or companion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the twin brother did something she didn't like and she turned his picture to the wall
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hers happened to be on the same frame too but she evidently dink care about it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now what have you to say s this bragg
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i thought we were stumped again when i first saw that picture but it spent of some us after all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do youse suppose the mature was a copy of the same thing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one of the world visit query choice

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will come andy he this afternoon with old clothes on and half a regular house cleaning
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it can't heard anything i'm sure for we won't disturb things at all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this fawn however did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: smuggle in the house cleaning paraphernalia into the cellar window unobserved that afternoon proved no easy task for scythia had added a wis boom and dust pan to the outset

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: surface des at least had been leaved and the fine oldest furniture gave a hints of its real elegance polish
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then she suddenly remarked
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and my pocket money is getting low again and you have it any left as usual
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they say i lumination by candlelight as the previous in the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why it's comme ath as usual they both cried peering in
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: is that he the greatest r begin to odd corners
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: forgetting all their weariness they seethe the candles and street through the house finding on occasional paper tucked away in some add corner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well i confessed that the boarded up house mystery happened not earlier than april sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probably not much leader
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no words were spoken no language was uttered saint d of winging in hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and g in reality
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i heard a noise behind i turned and saw kaffer his blacks eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted above his head as if to strike but i had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: onward set a distant voice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no sound broke the stillness of the night
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition i wondered whether there was not some truth and what had been said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what was that
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what then a human hand large and shape we have here distinctly on the surface of the pond
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nothing more not even the wrist to which it might be attached
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it did not beckon or indeed moved all it was as still as the hand of death
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i awoke to consciousness fighting at first it seemed as if i was fighting with the phantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was caher
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a sound of voices a flash of light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a feeling of freedom and i was awake where
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: said another voice would ii recognize that fal chose caff
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had scarcely known when i had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke i looked at my hand
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the light of the moon i saws a knife red with blood and my hand too was also discoloured
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i do not know i am dazed bewildered
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but that is calf's life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know y he had at this very evening
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i remembered saying half we didn't together
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh chair picked up something from the ground and looked at it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i say you do know what this means and you must tell usin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a terrible thought flashed into my mind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had again been acting under the influence of this man's power
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: perchance too calf's death might serve him in good stead
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my tongue refused articulate my power of speech left me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my position was too terrible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my overwrought nerved healed at last
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for some time after that i remembered nothing distinctly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the three modes of management
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in affecting such a substitution is that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by reason and affection

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: while former foretold that the scottish cover enters were secretly forming a union with the english parliament and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking the latter still insisted that every such attempt would precipitate then into measures to which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the king's ears were now opened to montrose counsels who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal caws in scotland
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: five hundred men more who had been levied by the can enters were persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combined force he hastened to attack lord alco who lay at perth with an army of six thousand men assembled upon the first mars of the irish invasion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: dreading the superior power of ar dial who having joined his vassals to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerable army montrose hastened northwards in order to rouse again the marquise of hope le u gordons who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the covenanters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this nobleman's character though celebrated for political courage and conduct was very low for military prowess and after some stern wishes in which he was worsted he here aloud montrose to escape him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by quick marchers through these inaccessible mountains that general freed himself from the superior forces of the covenanters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with these and some reinforcements of the ethel menan and dolls whom he had recalled montrose fou suddenly upon ar giles country and let loose upon it all the rage of war carrying off the cattle burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this severity by which montrose sullied his victories was the results of private animosity against the chieftain as much as of zeal for the public cause our guile collecting three thousand men marched in quest of the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at inner lucky supposing himself still at a considerable distance from them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by a quicks and unexpected march montrose hastened to inner lucky and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised but not a frightened covenants
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his conduct and presence of mind in this emergence appeared conspicuous
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: montrose weak in cavalry here lined his troops of horse with infantry and after putting the enemy's horse to route fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cut in pieces o with the loss of the gallant lord gordon on the part of the royalists
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the same men new regiments and new companies were formed different officers appointed and the hall military force put into such hands as the independence could on
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: besides members of parliament who were excluded many officers ogling to serve under the new generals threw up their commissions unwarily facilitated the projects of putting the army entering into the hens of that faction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: their be discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible a more exacts plan was introduced and rigorously executed by these new commanders
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: valor indeed was very generally diffused over the one party as well as the others during this period discipline also was attained by the forces of the parliament but the perfection of the military art in concerting the general plans of action and the operations of the field scenes still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: historians at least perhaps from their own ignorance and in experience have not remarked anything but headlong impetuous conducted each party hurrying to a battle where valor and fortune chiefly determined the success
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he passed through henley seat albans then came so nears london as harrow on the hill
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the scottish generals and commission as effected great surprise on the appearance of the king and though they paid him all the exterior respect due to his dignity they instantly sit a guard upon him under colour of protection and made him in reality a prisoner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they informed the english parliament of this unexpected incident and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: or hath he given us and gift
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the men of israel outs at the men of judah and said we have ten parts in king and we have also more right in david than yee why then did yee despise uses that our advice should not be first had in bring back our king
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: another preacher after reproaching him to his face with his misgovernment ordered this some to be sung
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the kings stood up and called for that sum which begins with these words
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: have ice lord on me i pray for men with me devour
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the good natured audience in pity to fallen majesty show for once greater deference to the king than to the minister and so the sum which the former had called for
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the parliament than the scots laid their proposals before the king
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: before the settlement of terms the administration must be possessed entirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms and how incompatible that skin with the liberty of the king is easily imagined
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the english it is evident had they not being previously assured of receiving the king would never have parted with so considerable of some and while they weakened themselves by the same measure have strengthen a people with whom they must afterwards have so material and interest to disgusts
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if any still retain rancor against him in his present condition they passed in silence while his well wishers more generous and prudent accompanied his march with tears with acclamations and with prayers for his safety
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his death in this conjuncture was a public misfortune
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the analysis of knowledge will occupy u until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: would is called perceptions differs from sensation by the facts that the sensational ingredients bringing up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual cleats all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: whether not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that i does approximately represent impressions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and what sort of evidence is logically possible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world spring into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with the population that remembered a wholly unreal past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: all that im doing is to use its logical tina ability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the behaviourist who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour has distrust his memory in making the record
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: habit is a concepts involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but i do not think such an inference is warranted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristics of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a france face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some images like some sensations fill very familiar while others fill strange
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: familiarity is a filling capable of degrees
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in an image of a well known face for example some parts may fl more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of de past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they must have some characteristics which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness and some remembered event
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of fastness especially where immediate memory is concerned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such fillings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if we had retained the subjects or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: remembering has to be of present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some points may be taken ives fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this case as in most others what may be taken a certain in advance is rather v
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least served to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediate sey
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to thus the incidents of its past and people are not so different from ground phones as they like to believe
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can set to wor now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: simmons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they give laws according to which images of pasts occurrence is come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leaves us to search the environment until we are satisfy that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling a familiarity alone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a further stage is recognition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more that a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristics we may happen to recognize in the catt of the moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an objects that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first since and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this knowledge is memory and one sense though in another it is not
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory a among the most important
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thus if i recognize the thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition the recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is single doubt from the rest of the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: had e her crasweller not been good looking had jack been still at college had sir canning toon ovver remained in england had mister bonnet and the barkeeper not succeeded and stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in arraying for the final departure of my old friend
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on arriving at home at my own residence i found that our salon was filled with a brilliant company
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mode of addressed that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i have come to your sure as mister president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have our little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rose water
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we are quite satisfied now captain battle axe said my wife
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: quite satisfied said eva
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the ladies in compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic are on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed or on the other
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no doubt in process of time the ladies will follow
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there masters said missus never bent
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i did not mean said captain ble lax the touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: missus never been you must indeed be proud of your son
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: jack had been standing in the far corner the room talking to eva and was now reduced the silence by his praises
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sir kennington oval is very fine player said my wife
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i and my wife and sun and the two cress wells and three or four others agreed to dam bo the shipped on the next
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this i felt was paid to me as being president other republick and i endeavoured to behave myself such mingled humility and dignity as might be fit the occasion but i could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my wife on the spur the moment managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part to fathers and mothers of the young ladies
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh yes a jack and i'm nowhere
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but i mean to have my innings before long
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of what missus never b had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplice her tasks with thorough success
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then went ashore
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how much of evil of real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me during the last few days
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: w cy do now but just lay myself down and die
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the death of which i dropt could not alas
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the furthest side of the island and they are in seclusion what i end my days
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: jack would become either's happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thinking of all this i went sleep
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister never bend began the captain and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president they cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you have received us with all that courtesy in hospitality for which your character in england stand so high
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is a duty said i
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but your power is so supper to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace and yielding to it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not a dal but had your force been only double or trouble our own i should have found at my duty to struggle with you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that is all quite true mister never been said sir ferdinand brown
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can afford to smile because i am absolutely perilous before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have been on board
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then said sir fernando there is nothing for it but that we must take you with him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you hear what sur ferdinand o brown h s replied captain battle ax
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but one is a delicate mission i asked
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage and mattered not which
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then the republic of britain ea was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor in stalled in the executive chambers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you may be quite shorts there said captain battle axe and that i can so use it asked to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you propos to kidnap me i said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what will become of your gun or i to cannot you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: lieutenant cross tries is a very gallant officer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one of us always remains on board while the others on sure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible my just like centred itself on sur ferdinand
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will allow me to suggest that he but that is a matter of opinion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: were i to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the letter ran as follows
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sir i have ant in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crowned colony which is called britain ma
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the procure their circumstances of the colony are within your excellency's knowledge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in their selection of a constitution the britain e lists have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has from their present difficulties
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is founded on the acknowledge weakness of those who survive at pio of life at which men cease to work
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but it is surmise that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your governor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the john bright is arm with a weapon of great power against which it is impossible that the people of britain ea should prevail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will carry out with you one h her men of the north northwest birmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own sturdy as it is thought that if mister never been be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: w you inten that the john bright shall starr
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: today i shouted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the arise of the government
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i shall be happy to take charge of them said sur fernando
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they of course must all the author
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: your power is sufficient i said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if you will give us your promise to meet captain a ox here at this time to morrow we will stretch a point and delayed the departure of the john bright for twenty four hours
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and this plan was adopted too in order to extract for me a promise that i would depart in peace
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this was what did the mischief so far as the running away was concerned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is hardly necessary to say more of them here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the manner in which he expressed himself with herding to robert holland no man in the whole range of his recollections will be long to remembered than he his inhuman while under holland will hardly ever be forgotten
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of this party edwards a boy of seventeen called forth much sympathy he too was claimed by holland
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: john leslie compas jacob tailor and thomas edwards skinner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a few years back one of their slaves a coachman was kept on the coach box one cold night when they were out at a ball until he became almost frozen to death in fact he did die in the infirmary from the effects of the frost about one week afterwards
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the doctor who attended the entered creature in this case was simply told that she slipped and fell down the stairs as she was com again
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: another case said john wesley was a little girl half grown who was washing windows upstairs one day and unluckily fell asleep in the windowed and in this position was found by her mistress in a raged the mistress hit her a heavy slap knocked her out of the windowed and she felled to the pavement and died in a few hours from the effects thereof
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as usual nothing was done in the way of punishment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i never knew of but one man who could ever please him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he worked me very hoard he wanted to be beating me all the town
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was a large homely woman they were common white people with no reputation in the community
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: substantially this was jacob's unvarnished descriptions of his master and mistress
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as to his age and also the name of his master jacob statement varied somewhat from the advertisement
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of starting i didn't know the way to come
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: its almost beyond conjecture
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this reality begins to explained dark power and other worldly fascination of twenty thousand leagues under the seas
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: first as a paris stockbroker later as a celebrated author and yachtsmen he went on frequented forages to britain america the mediterranean
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nemo built a fabulous future hic submarine the nautilus than conducts an underwater campaign of vengeance against his imperialist oppressor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in all the novel hadad a difficult gestation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: other subtleties occurred inside each episode the textures sparkling with wit information and insight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his specifications for an open sea submarine at a self containing diving suit were decades before their time yet modern technology bears them out triumphantly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: even the supporting cast is shrewdly drawn professor aronnax the career scientist caught in an ethical conflict call say the compulsive classifier who supplies humorous tag lives for verds fast facts the harpooner ned land a creature of constant appetites man as heroic animals
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but much of the novels brooding power comes from captain below
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this compulsion leads nemo into ugly contradictions he is a fighter for freedom yet all who board his ship or imprisoned there for good he works to save lives both human and animals if he himself creates a hull cost he detests imperialism yet he lays personal claim to the south bull
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and in this last action he falls into the classic sin of pride
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hes swiftly punished
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the nautilus nearly parishes in the antarctic and nemo sinks into a growing depression
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for any then this book has been a source of fascination surely one of the most influential novels ever written an inspiration for such scientists and discoverers as engineer simon lake ocean arrah william b be polar travelers s earnest shackleton
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fathom sixth feet
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: graham roughly one twenty eight of announce
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: milligram roughly one twenty eight thousand of announce
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: leader roughly one court
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: meter roughly one yard three inches
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mill maiter roughly one twenty fifths of an inch
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: chapter three as master wishes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: three seconds before the arrival of j bee hobson's letter i know more dream of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the northwest passage
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: even so i had just return from an arduous journey exhausted and badly meeting rest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wanted nothing more than to see by country again a friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved collections
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but now nothing could hold me back
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cas say was my man's servants
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from rubbing shoulders with scientists in a little universe by the botanical gardens the boy had come to know a thing or two
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: classifying was everything to him so he do nothing else well versed in a theory of classification he was poorly first in its practical application and doubt that he could tell a sperm wale from a balan waal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and yet what a fine gallant lad
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of the journey
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: never did he object to buckling up his suit case for any country whatever china or the congo no matter how far off it was
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he went here there and everywhere in perfect contentment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: place forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting that i had turned forty
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was a fanatic on formality and he only addressed me in the third person to the point where got hy some
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was good reason to stop and think even for the world's most in motionless man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cass i called a third time cuss appeared
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: deid masters summon me he said entering
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pack as much into my trunk as you can my traveling kit my suits shirts and socks don't brot ac counting just squeal inn and hurry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will deal with them later what
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: anyhow will leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to france
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes we are certainly i replied evasively but after we mate a detour
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a route slightly less direct that's all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: were leaving on the abraham lincoln
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you see my friend it's an issue of the monster the notorious nor a wall
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we don't know wherever will take us
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but were going just the same
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have a commander whose game for anything
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i left instructions for shipping my contains of stuffed animals and dried plants to paris france
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the barbara and conseil at my heels i jumped into a carriage
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate i rushed aboard
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i asked for commander fergit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one of the sailors led me to the after deck where i stood in the presence of a smart looking officer who extended his hand to me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in person welcome aboard professor your cabin is waiting for you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officer's mass
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will be quite comfortable here i told conseil
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some scepticism
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wharves of brookland and every part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: de party from five hundred thousand throats three cheers burst forth in successions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hailing the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new york city
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then he roche downstairs into the courtyards shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to catch everybody his dominions at the sailor was not recaptured
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cold him fast manon an and as soon as i had my coffee in i'll take him to the room of the great knife and patch him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wouldn't mind n up a gulfy myself said cam i've had considable ex sits eyes this mornin and i'm m or any for breakfast
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but cap'n bill made no such attempt knowing it would be useless
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boolooroo gave a yellow disappointment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the room of the great knife was high and big and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators the cit upon
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in one place at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant thrown chairs for the king and queen and six smaller but richly a poste chairs for the snubs princesses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: therefore her majesty paid no attention do anyone and no one paid any attention to her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as corcus as the wor haughty and overbearing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: morning girls so people as well as you look
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: control yourselves my dears replied the bloo the worst punishment i knew how to inflict on egg one this prisoners about to suffer you will see a very pretty patching my royal daughters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: suppose its of bring
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the captain shook his head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: while you sit to thatch the first living cric we met and that was the spirit note replied the captain panting hard as he held that to one of the goat's horns
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the idea of patching cap'n bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him and a more he thought of it th where he roared with laughter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they yok something liar you know suggested the captain of the gars looking from one to the other doubtfully and then nearly the same soars if he stand bo from his hi legs they'd both caught the same style of whiskers and they' both for them obstinate and dangerous so they ought to make a good patch splendid
