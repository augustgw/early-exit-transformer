as i approached the city i heard bells ringing and a little later i found the streets astir with throngs of well dressed people in family groups winding their way hither and thither
looking about me i saw a gentleman in a neat black dress smiling and his hand extended to me with great cordiality
he must have realized i was a stranger and wished he tendered his hospitality to me i accepted it gratefully i clasped his hand he pressed martin
we gazed for a moment slightly into each other's eyes
of course you are going there too i said to my friendly guide
yes he answered i cannot the worship i am a priest
an idol i whispered taken by surprise
they worshipped god they did not exist
but the greeks love their gods i protested my heart clam me my breast
no i said in a low voice
he was an idol then and not a god
it made athena see of light it created the beautiful the true the good yes our religion was divine
it had only one fault inroad of my guide what was that
i enquired without knowing what his aunts would be it was not true
produce him
i wish me to myself what blasphemy
then taking heart i told my guide how more than once i had felt apollo's radiant presence in my heart and told him of the immortal lines of homer concerned the devon apollo
do you doubt homer
i said to him homer the inspired bard
no no apollo is not an idle
he is a god and the son of a god
the air was heavy with incense a number of men in gorgeous vestments were passing to and fro thou in a kneeling before the various lights and images
observing my anxiety to understand the mean of all this my guide took me aside and in a whisper told me that a people were celebrating the anniversary of the birth the o their beautiful saviour jesus the son of god
forget apollo he said with a suggestion of severing his voice
there is no such person he was only an idol
if he were to search for apollo and all the universe he would never find e one answering to his name were description
i want to see jesus i hasten turning toward him
will he not be here this morning
will he not speak to his worshippers i asked again
will he not permit them to touch him to caress his hand to class his divine feet to u held the ambrosial fragrance of his breath to bask in the golden light of his eyes to hear the music of his immaculate accents
i asked my eyes feel with wonder and my voice quivering with excitement
would not that then i venture to ask impatiently make uses as much of an idol as apollo
and if faith that jesus is a god proves him a god why will not faith an apollo make him a god
but i am determined not only to know if it is possible the whole truth about jesus but also to communicate that truth to others
but there is more of a moral tonic in the open and candy discussion of a subject like the one in hand than in the multitude of platitudes
i never deliver a lecture in which i do not even directly or indirectly if full and free expression to my faith in everything that is worthy of faith
if i do not believe in dogma it is because i believe in freedom
oh he tears down but he is not build up is another criticism about my work it is not true
no preacher preaches more constructive
clasping truth in a jail wagging the mouth of the student is that building up or tearing down
when brindle light a new torch to increase the lie of the world well as his forward the stake
count your rights political religious social intellectual and tell me which of them was conquered for you by the priest
i wish to tell you something
the first less be impersonal epithets irreverent blasphemer atheist an infidel are flung at a man not from pity but from envy
not having the courage or the industry of our neighbour who works like a busy bee in the world of men and books searching with the sweat of his brow for the real bread of life when in the open page afore him with his tears pushing into the wee hours of the night his quest and mated by the fairest of all loves the love of truth we ease our own indolent conscience by calling him names
a myth is a fanciful explanation of a given phenomenon
the mind craves for knowledge the child asked questions because of unborn desire to know
now and then they came close enough to snap at each other
w this mid thos the prone to man was satisfied until his developing intelligence realized its inadequacy science was born of that realization
the myth of a one eyed people living in india has in replace by actor information concerning the hindus
and this is precisely the use to which news even put

there is in man of faculty for fiction
it thinks lesson it guesses
it is reflection which introduces up being into the mouth of imagination curbing its place and subduing its relentless spirit
we feel the space about and over us o spirits fairies gods and other invisible and airy beans
we covered the rainbow we reach out for the moon
our feet not really being to touch the firm ground until we have reached the years of discretion
science was not borne till man matured
grown up people craves science
the cradle is the womb of all the fairies and face and mankind
the school is the birthplace of science
relating was the science of the child
in the discussion of this subject i appeal to the maturer not to the child mind
he is god's mouth peace and no one may disagree with him
the on way i may command your respect is do reasonable
let us place ourselves entirely in the hands of the evidence
as intelligent beans would desire to know whether this jesus whose worship is not only costing the world millions of the people's money but which is also drawing to his service the time the energies the affections the devotions and the labor humanity is a myth or reality
a number of other dates were observed by a christian church at various times as the birthday of jesus the goss was give no date and appear to be quite uncertain really ignorant about it
yet there is no evidence that he was born on that day
why this discrepancy and the historical document you say nothing about inspiration
again matthew says that to escape the evil designs of herod mary and joseph with the infant jesus fled into egypts loops has nothing about this hurried flight nor of herod's intention to kill the infant messiah
when we come to the more important chapters of ab jesus we meet with quitter difficulties
what is always on a friday that the crucifixes commemorated the week in which the day occurs very shear a year
good friday falls not before the spring equinox but as soon after the spring equinox is the full moon lows thus making the calculation to depend upon the position of the sun and the zodiac and the phases of the moon
the pagan austria has become a christian easter
but in the absence of evidence ordering offers of following metaphysical arguments against the epical sells one
if we are to have any mythology at all he seems to argue why object to adding to it the mists of jesus
the immediate companions of jesus appear to be on another hand as mythical as he is himself
who was matthew who was mark
who were john peter judas and marry
there is actually no evidence that they ever existed
if peter ever went to rome with the new doctrine how is it that no historian has taken note of him
here again we see the presence of a myth
he was the only one who saw them
peter paul john james judas occupy the stage almost exclusively
it is impossible to explain why the contemporaries of jesus the authors and the historians of this time do not take notice of him
could they have been a conspiracy against him
how is his unanimous size be accounted for
how then are we to decide which the numerous candidates for divine honor should be given our votes
and such a faith is never free it is always maintained but a sword now and by hell fi hereafter
yet the most impossible utterances are put in use mouth
only a mythical jesus could virtually hand over the government of levers d quarters who have petitions to press upon his attention
moreover g jesus could keep his promise there would be today no misery in the world no orphans no childless mothers no shipwrecks no floods no famines no disease no crippled children no insanity no wars no crime no wrong
have these prayers been answered
how he self deluded profits these extravagant claims have produced
and who can number the bitter disappointments caused by such impossible promises
the same which a preachers of the day give he parried his aunts with many words and at length said that the promise was betaken with the provision that what we asked for would be given if god fi it for our good
but he said if he ask anything in my name i will do it and if it were not so i would have told you
did he not mean just what he said
self effort and not prayer is a really against ignorance slavery poverty and lore degradation
it was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity when with impressible persons love becomes so listlessness hope sinks to misgiving and faith to hope when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret and opportunities for ambition that have been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise
still to a close observer they are just as perceptible the difference is that their media of manifestation are less trite and familiar than such well known ones as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf
if anything could be darker than the sky it was the wall and if anything could be gloomier than the wall it was the river beneath

the shape went slowly along but without much exertion for the snow though sudden was not as yet more than two inches deep
at this time some words were spoken aloud one
two three
four five
between each utterance the little shape advanced about half a dozen yards
the other spot stopped and dwindled smaller
then a mussel of snow flew across the river towards the fifth window
the river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort which races midland sides with the same gliding precision any irregularities of speed being immediate corrected by a small whirlpool
the we never struck again in the same manner
then a noise was heard apparently produced by the opening of the window
said the blood spot in the snow tremulously
i asked which was your window forgive me

he stated her bodily by encircling her waist with his arm and she made no objection
he pitied her and while he wondered at it admired her determination
their application for a mission lent her to the withdrawal of a bolt and they stood within the gaslight of the passage

i will tell the servant to do this and send you up something great
he felt ravenously hungry himself and set about drying his clothes as well as he could and eating at the same time

she thought a little and then they went on to talk about her house which had been newly painted and decorated with greenish blue satin up to the height of a person's head an arrangement that somewhat improved her slightly faded though still pretty face and was helped by the awnings over the windows
yes i have had my house some years she observed complacently and i like it better every year
don't you feel lone in it sometimes oh never
what an uncivil thing to say she murmured in surprise
it is rather uncivil

yes the very vulgar of the electric art light made harder the arrival of the incandescent
a number of parents arc lining compass were in existence and a great many local communists having called into the under franchise for commercial business and to execute regular city contracts for the street lining
thus and the curious manner the mile art of luxury lining was in a very true sense divided against itself within times reveries and jealousies which were nevertheless real because they were by temporary and occurring fought were out in evening in the forest wor inevitable
hence twenty years after the first ads in station were established the methods they involved could be fairly credited with no less than sixty seven per cent
it will be readily understood that under these conditions the mud lining humpy supplies to its customers both incandescent and arc lining frequently from the same denial electric machinery as the stores of current and that the old food asked between the rivals sence has died out
in fact for some years past the presidents of the national electrical light association have been chosen almost exclusively from among the managers of the great alison mining compass in the midden cities
the other strong opposition to the incandescent light came from the gas indo screw
there also the most peter feeling was shown
the gas manager did not like arc light but he interfered only with his street service which was not his large source of income by enemies
here again was given the most convincing demonstration of the truth that such an addition to the resources of mankind or was carries with it unsuspected benefits even for his enemies
this was not long not unity the spirit is shown and to day in hundreds of sites the electric and guess provis are united under that one management which does not find it impossible to bush in the friendly and progressive way the use of both illuminates

in my reason travels in the rest i felt that out their freedom as an idea has become feeble and ineffectual
the same things have been now with the people of the rest
they are flattered into believing that they are free and they have the sovereign power in their hands
thus it has become more and more evident to me that the ideal of freedom has grown tenuous in the atmosphere of the best
the mentality is that of a slave owning community but a mutilated multitude of men tied to its commotion and political treadmill

when the aid of the buda came humanity was tore in our country to its utterly depth
it hardened into an age of a note construction
the organic unity of a varied and elastic society gave way to a conventional odor which proved its artificial character by its inexorable law of exclusion
life hath at any qualities i admit but they are natural and are in harmony with our vital functions
by squeezing human beings in the grape of an in elastic system and forcibly holding them fixed we have ignored the laws of life and growth
we have forced living selves into a potan and passivity making them incapable of moulding circumstance to their own intrinsic design and of mastering their own destiny
our stupefaction has become so absolute that we do not even realize that this persistent misfortune dogging us cheats for ages cannot be of mere accident of history removable only by another accident from outside

lift this young men up and carry him to the dressing station
prince andrew remembered nothing more he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted on to the stretcher the jolting while being moved and the probing of his wound at the dressing station

prince andrew had also been brought forwards before the emperor's eyes to complete the show of prisoners could not fail to attractive attention
his feet shone with sen satisfaction and pleasure
the soldiers who had carried prince andrew had noticed and taken the little gold ey kon princess mary had hung round her brother's necks but seeing the favor the emperor showed the prisoners they now hastened to return the holy image
prince andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced but the little eye corn with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform

he was gone
no more deep blue skies or comes in amber tins
she sat by herself at the fire with unlighted candles on the table behind her and being over the day the happy walk happy sketching cheerful pleasant dinner and the uncomfortable miserable walk in the garden
here was she disturbed and unhappy because her instinct had made anything but to refuse it impossible while he not many minutes after he had met with rejection of what order have been the deepest wholly proposal of his life could speak as if its briefs success and all his superficial consequences of a good house never an agreeable society with a soul of bout objects of his desires oh dear
her mother came into the room before this royal of pulse was adjusted into anything like order
mister hale sipped his tea in extracted silence margaret had the responses all to herself
she forgot that he had not made them an offer
margaret was repairing her mother's worsted work and while the shrinking from the thought of the long evening and wishing bedtime were come that she might go over the events of the day again
margaret
wanted to speak to about something very seen as to us all
very serious to a saul
mister lennox had never had the opportunity of having any point's conversation with a father after her refusal or else that would indeed be a very serious affair
but she soon felt it was not about anything which having only lately and suddenly occurred could have given rise to any complicated thoughts and her father wished to speak to her
mister hale did not answer for a mayre duo
margaret could not bear the sight of missus spence which was even more distressing to her father than to herself
but why dear papa don't tell me
because i must no longer be a minister in the church of england
but nothing to the shock shrew received from mister hale's last speech what could he mean
it was all the worse for being so mysterious
why can you no longer be a clergyman
surely it's a bishop told all we know about frederick and the hardened just
margaret i will tell you about it
a re lance her any questions this once but after to night let us never speak of it again
i can need the consequences of my painful miserable doubts but it is an effort beyond me to speak of what has calls me some with suffering
no not doubts as to religion not the slightest injury to that he paused
margaret's sight as if standing on the words of summing in horror
margaret how i love the holy church from return to be shut out
he could not go on for a long one jot in
margaret could not tell what to say it seemed to her as terribly mysterious as if her father were about to do whom mahometan
the one state foundation of her harm of her idea of her beloved father seem wheeling and walking
he swallowed down the dry choking sob which had been heaving up from his heart har the tool and going to his bookcase he took down a volume which he had often been reading lately and from which he thought he had due right sprint to enter upon the course in which he was now in bar
listen day margaret said he putting one arm round her waist
when god will not use dee one kind yet he will in another
if when thou art charged with corrupting golds worship also find thy loves though pretendedst a necessity or it own loder to a continuance in the ministry
as he read this and glanced at much more which he did not read he gained resolution for himself and felt as if he too could be brave and firm in doing what he believed to be right but as he ceased he heard margaret's low convulsive sob and his courage sang down under the keen sense of suffering
i have borne long with self reproach that would have roused anyone less tor bid and cowardly than mine
he shook his head as he went on
margaret i tried to do it i tried to content myself with simply refusing the dal prevalent and stopping quietly here strangling my conscience now as i had strained it before
god forgive me
he rose and walked up and down the room speaking no words of self reproach and humiliation of which margaret was thankful to hear but a few
margaret i returned to the old said burden we must leave helstone
yes
i have written to the bishop i day say i've told you so but i forget things just now said mister hale collapsing into his depressed manner as soon as he came to took a card natural fact details informing him of my intention to resign the speaker
they are but what i have cried upon myself withouten wail
that will be a tal but worse fallows will the departing for my dear people
he will come to stay with us to morrow
was it to be some seven m
what is mamma say
margaret i am a poor calla it after all i cannot fare to give pain
yes indeed she must said margaret
perhaps after all she may not oh yes
she well she must be shot as the force of the blow re turned upon herself and crying to realize how another would take it
to milton know them he answered with a dull indifference for he had perceived that although his daughter's love had made her cling to him and for a moment tried to sing with him with her love yet the keenness of the pain was as fresh as ever in her mind
milton you all them
yes said he in the same despondent in different way
but he with this quick intuitive something read in her face as a a mirror the reflections of his own moody depression and turned it off with an effort
you shall be told old robert
only help me to tell your mother
i am going out for the day to bid father dobson and the poor people on bracy common good bye
would you dislike breaking it to her very much margaret
margaret did dislike it dick ching from it more than from anything she had ever had to do in her life before
mister hale shook his head despondingly he pressed her hand in token of attitude
margaret was nearly upset again into a burst of pine
to damn her thoughts she said now tell me paa what up danza
you and mamma have some money independent of the income from the living have not you on ty has i know
seventy of that has always gone to frederick since he has been abroad
you must have some painful serving with the spanish arming
frederick must not suffer said margaret decidedly in a foreign country so unjustly treated by his own a hundreds is left
no
said mister hale that would not answer i must do something
i can always decide better by myself and not influenced by those whom i love said he as a half apology for having arraigned so much before he had told any one of his family of his intentions
i can out stand objections
i made me so undecided
mister hale continued a few months ago when my miserie of death became more than i could be without speaking i wrote to mister bell you remember mister bell margaret
no i never saw him i think
at any rate he has property there which has very much increased and value since milton has become such a large manufacturing town
i don't know that he gave you my friend
a private tutor
said margaret looking scornful what in the world in manufactures one with the cassocks on literature on the accomplishments of a gentleman
oh said her father some of them really seem to be fine fellows conscience of their own deficiencies which is more than many a man at boxer is
somewhat picture to be better instructed than they themselves have been
and in milton margaret i shall find a busy life not a happy one and people and singing so different that i shall never be reminded of helstone
discordant as it was with almost a detestation for all she had ever heard of the north of england the manufactures the people the while in bat country there was this one recommendation it would be different from helstone and could never remind them of that beloved place
when do we go
i do not know exactly
i want you to talk it over with you
you see your mother knows nothing about it yet but i think in a fortnight after my deed of resignation assented i shall have no right to remain
margaret was all withstand
but she recovered herself immediately
yes papa it had better be fixed soon and decidedly as you say
poor poor maria
oh if i were not married if i were but myself in the world how easy it would be
no said margaret sadly i will do it
you must not deceive yourself into doubting the reality of my words my fixed intention and resolve
he looked at her in the same steady stony manner for some moments after he had on speaking
the blessing of god be upon thee my child
the next moment she feared lest this answer to his blessing might be wrent long might hurt him as coming upon his daughter and she threw her arms around his neck
she heard him murmured to himself the martyrs and confesses had been more pain to bear i will not shrink
they were startled by hearing missus hale inquiring for her daughter
it was long since a rostov had news of nicholas
not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son's handwriting
on receiving it he ran on tip toe to his study and alarm and haste trying to escape notice closed the door and began to read the letter
each time at these hens began to meet the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at anna mikhaylovna the latter very adroitly turned the conversation to insignificant matters
but for god's say be careful you no hurt me a fet your mamma
no a my true want of honor said natasha crossing herself i won't tell anyone
and she ran off at once to sonya
she rushed to sonia haled her and began to cry
it's true that all y women are cry babies remarked pens piecing the room with large resolute straits
your all b lubbers and understand nothing
natasha smiled through her tears
what nasty brutes the
hold your tongue pater what a goose you are
sonya smiled do i remember n clus
i remember nikolinka too i remember him well she said
no she shut her eyes
she felt that sonya was speaking the truth that the worst such love as sonya was speaking of
she believed it could be but did not understand it
shall you write to him she asked
now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of herself and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had taken on himself
i don't know
sonya smiles no
it's because she was in log without fat one his spectacles that was her pitcher descried his namesake the new count bezukhov and now she's in love without singer he met natasha's italian singing master that's why she's ashamed
petya you're stupid said natasha
the countess had been prepared by enemy kova's heads at dinner
on retiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox while the tears kept coming into her eyes
the coats pretty his ear to the keyhole and lizard
at first he heard a sound of indifferent voices then anna mikhaylovna's voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silence then both voices together with glad intonations and then fruit steps
anna mikhaylovna opened the door
when she heard this sonya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and unable to be the looks turned upon her ran away into the dancing hall we're old round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon and flushed and smiling plumped down on the floor
the comtesse was cry
from all he says one should be glad and not cry
how charmingly he described said she reading the descriptive part of the letter and what a soul
i always said when he was only so high i always said
the pavlograd held feast after feast celebrating awards they had received for the campaign and made expeditions to all moods to visit a certain caroline the hungarian who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses
the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading their cleanliness and discipline
the regiments had entered and left the town with their bands playing and by the grandee s's orders the men had marched all the way in step a practice on which the guards prided themselves the officers on fruit and at their proper pulse
boris had been quartered and had marched all the way with berg who was already in commin of a company
boris during the campaign had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become acquainted with prince andrew bolkonski though whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in chief stuff
berg and boris having rested after yesterday's march were sitting clean and neatly dressed at a round table in the clean quarters a lotty to them plain chess
well how are you going to get out of that he remarked
at that moment door opened
dear me how you have changed
he was about to embrace his friends but nicholas avoided him
he wanted to pinch him push him do anything but kiss him a thing everybody did
but notwithstanding there spars embraced him in a quiet friendly we and kissed him three times
they had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when young men tied their first steps and life roads each saw immense changes in the other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps
i did not expect you to thee he added
you know of course at his imperial highness rode with our regiment all the time so that we in every comfort in every advantage
what receptions we had in polands
what dinners and balls i can't tell you
oh you guard said rostov i say sents a wine
he went to his bed drew a part under the clean pillow and sent for wine
yes and i have some money and letters to give you he added
oh don't mention it coes i quite understand said berg getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice
go of cross to argos they invited you added boris
berg put on the cleanest of coats without a spot or speck of dust stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and having insured himself from the way rostov looked at it that his court had been noticed left the room with a pleasant smile
oh dear what a beast i am muttered rostov as he read a letter why
well have you sent gabriel for some wite all right les how some
in the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to bagration which the old countess said anna mikhaylovna's advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to take it to his destination and make use of it
why have you thrown that away asked boris
it is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want it for
he looked intently and inquiringly into his friend's eyes evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question
which you believed it cit i was not at all alarmed as i knew i was right
i came forward burke stood up and showed how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self complacency than his date
well he stoned at me as the saying is stormed and stormed and stormed
there was not a matter of life but rather of death as the same is
albanian and devils and two siberia said burg with a sagacious smile
which still i remained silent and what do you think cat
the next day was not even mentioned in the orders of the day
that's the weak said burg lighting his pipe and emitting wings a smoke
yes i was fain said rostov smiling
rostov with a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie
he began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened the imperceptibly involuntarily and inevitably he lapsed into false suit
prince andrew who liked a help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed towards boris who had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what young man wanted
in spite of prince andrew's disagreeable ironical tone in spite of the contemn with which rostov from his fighting army point of views regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently won rostov felt confused blushed and became silent
face enquired what news there might be on the staff and whats without indiscretion one might ask about our plans
we shall probably advance replied bolkonski evidently reluctant to see more in the presence of a stranger
burke at the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was remote the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled
i was stared said rostov angry as if intending to insult the aid de camp
with a slightly contemptuous smile he said yes that are many stories now told him at that affair
but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy's fire
our stories have some weights not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get the wars without doing anything
however he added rising you know my name and we're to find me they don't forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted and as a man older than you my advice is to let the matter drop
exclaimed prince andrew and was about to them both he went out
and he was still more angry at having omitted to see us
he ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of bars rode home
should he go to headquarters next tea and challenge that affected adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that wide him all the wee
i see sure said some departed and not perhaps was out an inning too to get the island along with his happy snobs
where well do friends i say new little know that the individual who regards you from the beach is your friend and historiographer and pother
i went today to see our excellent fen s knocks on board the queen of the french many scores snobs were there on the tack of sad fine ship marching force in their pride and brave
they will be at austin in four hours they will inundate the continent next week they will carry into far lands the famous image of the british snob
i have seen snobs in pink coats and hunting boots scouring over the campan of rome and have heard the roads and their well known slang in the galleries of the basic and and under the shadowy arches of the colosseum
my lady marchioness comes on board looks round with said happy air of mingled terror and impertinence which distinguishes her ladyship and rushes to her carriage for it is impossible that she should mingle with the other snobs on deck
there she sits and will be ill in private
this strawberry leaves on her chariot panels are in great on her ladyship's heart
and davers you'd best take the pistol case into his cabin
look at honestest mace and hand stitch and his lady and their little son
what a noble air of blazing contentment illuminates the features of those snobs of eastern race
what at one at hound's ditches is
he will never spare himself any cheap enjoyment
i have said before i like to look at the peoples on the gala days they are so picturesquely and outrage sees blended and happy
yonder comes captain ball spick and span tight and trim but travels for four or sixth months seven year of his life who does not commit himself by luxury of raiment or insolence of demeanour but i think is as greatest suppers any man on board
bog passes the season in london sponging for dinners and leaping in a garret near his club
see he is up told carps already i told you he would
that broad shouldered bulk was a great whiskers and the clean white kid gloves is mister fallon clancy of paul duties down he calls himself mister de clancy he endeavours to disguise his native brok with the richest superposition of english and if you play at billiards or a cart with him did chances are that he will won the first game and he the seven or eight games ensuing
the next person is but hark
what a gross instance of snobbishness happens i should not the indignant journalist calls the public attention dues that delicacy too
how for instance could sat wonderful kate of the earl of mangel bertha and his brother be examined in the snobbish point of view
all we require hates that a man should be recommended to us by the earl of mangel roha
oh you pride of all snobling
only crawling truckling self confessed luckiest and parasites
it was her snobbish sentiment buttons letter and made her vanity a prey this swindling fortune tanner
how your count for the prodigious benevolence exercise towards the interesting you french lady
the honestest boarding house people were at her feet at lance
good honours simple lord loving children of snobling
finally there was a case of the right honble mister vernon at york
the right honourable was the son of a nobleman and practised on an old lady
then he cast his nets over a family of father mother and daughters one of them he proposed to marry
one day the traded blood with a teet water and a basket full of cold pictures
it was a ride honourable which bated the hook which gorge all these greedy simple snobs
what they have been taken in by commoner
alas and allays what water man that speaks the truths can help for such a landlady
and y all two spin sances of fond and credulous snobbishness have occurred in the same week's paper was who knows how many score more
we are three sisters move seventeen to twenty two
we are just the same to persons for mister hamilton's and amos des without it
if you do i cannot help it but i am of a sanguine disposition and entertain a lingering home
excuse this girl but i've always right had long
we never write on perfume to paper in george i can't help sinking that if he knew us we would not sing his snobs
i shall have a black draper and had my white hat and my usual bamboo came with the richly gil knob

there is no harmon being of a good family

that very confident savors of arrogance and to be arrogant is to be a snob
but are there no cunning natures though tender halves no souls humble simple entrees loving
ponder well on this question sweet young ladies
fray captain cow's i as i was going down and choose a cabin it's a man never overtaken by desk and this passage
why there's not time for a man to be sicking it replied he what a cursed liar for i am sick as a horse quinsy already for a brain outside down heyday

nay if you don't believe me you may read the chapter for your pains
with interest however still runs on in both cases the periodical or accident a payment of it just serving to keep the memory of the affair re life till at lengths in some evil hour pup comes a creditor upon each and by demanding principle upon the spot together is full interest to the very day makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations
as a reader for i hate your robs has a sorer knowledge of human nature i need not say more to satisfy him said my hero could not go on at this rate without some slight experience of season to gentle mementos
to speak the truth he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small book debts of this stamp which notwithstanding a genius as frequent advice he too much disregarded thinking that as not one of them was contracted through any malignity but on the contrary from an honesty of mind and the mere jo candy of humor they would all of them be crossed out in course
eugenius would never admit this and would often tell him said one day a rosa he would certainly be reckoned tows and he would often add in an accent of sorrowful apprehension tis uttermost might
what inclined eugenius to the same opinion was as follows
yorick followed eugenius was his eyes to the door his unclosed them and never opened them more
alas poor
now this is how arthur hunted the stag
and the last dog that was let loose was a favorite dog of arthur cabal was his name
then they sounded the death horn for slaying and they all gathered round
one wished that she be given to the lady best beloved by him and not that to the lady whom he loved best
and after midday they beheld an unshaped little man upon a horse and after him a day more a damsel also on horseback and after her a knight of live stature bowed down and hanging his head low and sorrowfully and clad in broken and worthless armour
i know not who they are said he but i know said guenever this is the night whom durin pursuit and meet thinks that he comes not here by his own free will
but durin has overtaken him in avenging insulted the maiden to the uttermost
lady said he at the gate there was a knight and i saw never a man of so pitiful an aspect to look upon as he
i do said he he tells me that he is erin the son of mood
then she replied i know him not
so guenever went to the gate to meet him and he entered
and durin greets thee well and in greeting thee he compelled me to come hither to do thy pleasure for the insult which thy maiden received from the dwarf no way did he overtake thee
sir said she when thinkest thou that durin will be here
to morley i think you will be here with the maiden
i am lord said he and i have met with much trouble and received wounds unsupportable
well a lather from what i hear it behooves whatever to be merciful towards thee
the mercy which thou desirest lord said she will i grant him since it is as insulting to thee that an insult should be offered to me as to thyself
thus will it be best to do said arthur let this man have medical care until it be known whether he may live
to waver and her hand maiden said he
and the steward of the household so ordered her
and being young he changed himself and grew to hate the sin that seemed so like his own of modred arthur's nephew and fell at last in the great battle fighting for the king
and when durin came to the place where guenever was he saluted her
then they went in and dismounted
heaven protect thee said arthur and the welcome of heaven be unto thee
and inasmuch as thou hast vanquished ed wan the son of ned thou hast had a prosperous career
and from that time she became his wife
and the maiden took up her boat in the palace and she had many companions both men and women and there was no maiden more esteemed than she in the island of britain
and a year and a second and a third he preceded thus until his fame had flown over the face of the kingdom
and he greets thee well as an uncle should greet his nephew and as a vassal should greet his lord
and the neighboring chiefs knowing this grow insolent toward him and covered his land in possessions
and a the told you aint the cause of the mission and of the coming of the ambassadors to him out of con wall truly said durin be it to my advantage orr disadvantage lord i will do according to thy will concerning this embassy
what discourse said guenever do i hear between you
said durin i think i shall have enough of knighthood with me and they set forth
and never was there seen a faro holts journeying towards the severn
and he said to current i am a feeble and an aged man and whilst i was able to maintain the demean for thee and for myself i did so
and everyone asked that which he desired
and they were not long in giving so eager was everyone to bestow gifts and of those who came to as gifts none departed unsatisfied
then curates and of basses to the men of cornwall to ask the miss
and they all said that it would be the fulness of joy and honour to them for durin to come and receive their homage
so he received the homage of such as were there
and the day after the followers of author intended to go away
drain as he had been used to do when he was at author's court frequent d tournaments
before durin the scored to the enemy i saw steeds white with foam and after the shout of battle a fearful torrent
these tidings came to urban
not i by my confession unto heaven said she there was nothing more hateful unto me than this
and the tis she said in the words she had spoken awoke him
and evil betide me said he if thou returnest here until thou knowest whether i have lost my strength so completely as thou didst say
then drane went to see urban
sir said he i am going upon a quest and i am not certain when i may come back
take heed therefore unto thy possessions until my return
but one person only will go with me
and he desired enid to mount her horse and to ride forward and to keep a long way before him
and unless i speak unto thee say not thou one word either
and though thou shouldst desire to see my defeat in my death by the hands of those men yet do i feel no dread
and he received him and that not feebly
and say not one word unto me unless i speak first unto thee
i will do as far as i can lord said she according to thy desire
a maiden said he it is vain to a temper seating forward
i cannot by any means refrain from sleep through weariness said he do thou therefore watched the horses and sleep not
and when she saw the dawn of day appear she looked around her to see if he were waking and thereupon he woke
and they left the wood and they came to an open country with meadows on one hand and mo was mowing the meadows
my lord he added will it be displeasing to thee if i ask whence thou comest also
wilt thou foul my counsel said the youth and take thy meal from me
what sort of meal he inquired
then they washed and took their repast
i go now lord said he to meet the knight and to conduct him to his lodging
i will do lord said she as thou sayest
and after they had eaten and drank drain went to sleep and so did een it also
the date seem unam point but throughout the period the offices and men of the ship have been unremittingly busy
bows attacked the ship stores surveyed re listen re stowed them saving very much space by unstoned numerous cases and stowing the contents in the lazarette
without steam the leek can now be kept under with the hand pump by two daily efforts of a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes
as the ship was and in her present heavily laden condition would certainly have taken three to four hours each day
the large green tent was put up and proper supports made for
the inter room staff in aeson's people on the engines scientist was stowing their laboratories the cook refitting his galley and so worth not a single spot but had its band of workers
the man space such as is there fork tends from the fore hatch the stem on the main deck
under the forecastle of stalls of fifteen ponies the maximum the space would hold the narrow irregular space in front was packed tight with fodder
neatly behind the forecastle brocade is a small booby hatch the only interest of the men's mess deck and bad weather
abaft the fore hatch is the ice house
we manage to get three tons of ice one hundred sixty two caucasus of mutton and three cocles of beef beside some boxes of sweetbreads and kidneys into this space
the sacks containing this last added to the goods already mentioned make a really heavy deck cargo and one is naturally anxious concerning it but everything that can be done by lashing and securing has been done
forage i originally ordered thirty tons of compressed oaten hay from melbourne
the scene is wholly enchanting in such a view from some sheltered sunny corner in a garden which blazes with masses of red and golden flowers tends to feelings of inexpressible satisfaction with all things
a great mass of people assembled
cain i lunch with the party in and zeal and company ship rupert
telegram to say tana had arrived sunday night
a third sledge stand across the break of the poop in the space hitherto occupied by the after wench
the quantities to in half tons and the space occupied considerable
the ship was over two feet by the stern but this will soon be remedied
they must perforce be chained up and they have given what shelters afforded on deck but their position is not enviable
it is a pathetic attitude deeply significant of cold and misery occasionally some poor beast amidst a long pathetic wine
there are generally wanted two on watch which uses matters but it is a squash
later in the day the wind has veiled to the westward heading us slightly
oates and atkinson with intermittent assistance from others or busy keeping the ponies on their legs
there was nothing for it but to grapple with the evil and nearly all hands were laboring for hours in the weights of the ship heaving coal sacks overboard and re lashing the petrol cases et cetera and the best maner possible under such difficult and dangerous circumstances
no sooner was some semblance of order restored than some exceptionally heavy wave would tear away the lashing and the work had to be done all over again
from this moment about for a m the engine became the centre of interest
the wad again despite of every effort
the outlook a paid grim
the amount of water which was being made with the ship so roughly handled was most uncertain
williams had to confess he was beaten and must draw fires what was to be done
the built pump is depended on the main engine
on one occasion i was waste deep and standing on the rail of the pooh
the after god were organized in two poddies by evans to work buckets the men were kept steadily going on the choke hand pumps this seemed all that could be done for the moment and what imaged account as the soul safe got of the ship from sinking practically an attempt to bail her out
occasionally a heavy sea would bear one of them away and he was only saved by his chain
the farm had taken this morning meal and now lay curled up on a bed of moss
whenever the fawn caught up he was quite content to frisk about
the danger was certain now it was near
the house had struck a trail where she turned and the farn was save
one was rolling the other had a gun in his hand what should she do
her tired lakes could not propel the tired bode rapidly
the gat saw the boat nearing her
in a moment more the boat was on her and the men at the oars had leaned over and caught her
i was tormented my thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctor's orders
that old m ceased to give so much annoyance yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams
felicia given them orders not to speak to me of this
this maid had stolen from me certain little things of some importance and in her fear of being detected she would have been very glad if i had died
accordingly she allowed me twice to take as much as i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask full i then covered myself and began to sweat and fell into a deep sleep
they see that my poor friend was on the point of falling to the ground so grieved was he to hear this
afterwards he took an ugly state and began to beat the serving girl with all his mind shouting out ah traitress you have killed him for me then
she may did have saved my life so let me a help in hand for i have sweated and be quick about it
vil aure recovered his spirits dried and make me comfortable and i been conscious of great improvement in my state began to reckon on recovery
just then thea the doctor bernardino put in his appearance who at the beginning of my illness had refused to bleed me
maestro franc chest coes at most able men exclaimed oh power of nature
she knows what she requires and the physicians know nothing
that simplon mice robert nino made uns san if he had drunk another bottle he would have been cured upon the spot
afterwards he turned to me and asked if i could have drunk more water
i answered no because i had entirely pointed my thirst
in like manner she was asking for what she wanted when the poor young man bad do to bleed him
if you knew that is recovery depended upon his drinking two flasks of water why did you not say so before
you might then have boasted of his kill
at these words the wretched quite sulkily departed and never showed his face again
the very evening i was taken with great precautions in a chair well wrapped up and protected from the cold
do not permit any irregularities for though he has escaped this time another disorder now would be the death of him
then he turned to me and said my benvenuto be prudent commit no excesses and when you are quite recovered i beg you to make me a madonna with your own hand and i will always pay my devotions to it for your sake
so i made my mind up and prepared to travel
that day many friends came to see me among others pierre l mannie who was the best and dearest friend i ever had
next day there came a certain niccolo d monte a gut who was also a very great friend of mine
i had harbored him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house upside down for the man was subject to a species of dry scab which he was always in the habit of scratching with his hands
meanwhile that able physician francesco d monte vary attended to m cure with great skill
there they sit at me to wait until the duke went by
many of my friends at court came up to greet me and expressed surprise that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shattered by illness they said that i ought to have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke
at these words mister agostino the duke's tailor made his way through all those gentlemen and said if that's all you want to know you shall know it at this very moment
george is a painter whom i have mentioned happened just then to pass and my astro agostino exclaimed there is the man will accuse you now you know yourself if it be true or not
as fiercely as i could not being able to leave my seat i asked georgia if it was true that he had accused me
he denied that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sword
my astro augustino retorted you gallows bird
what don't you know that i know it for most certain
georgia made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me
then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted
the duke gazed at me and marvelled i was still alive afterwards he bade mee take heed to be an honest man and regain my heals
when i reached home niccolo monte brute came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin written with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards take french leaf because my jeopardy came from a quarter and a man who was able to destroy me
i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had endured me and told him all the affair about the mint
he repeated get hence as quickly as you can and be of good courage for you will see your vengeance executed sooner than you expect
i the best attention to my health gave pietro bargo advice about stamping the coin and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else
you want them to immortalised that ferocious tyrant
you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you i will inveterate foe and their devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mind to hang you without any fault of yours
it was firmly believed that duke alessandro was the son of pope clement
mister francesco used also to say and swear by all his sins that if he could he would have robbed me of the dye for that meadow
i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more
i now sent to florence to request lorenzo that he would send me the reverse of the meadow
nicolo da montevideo to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher lorenz not for it he had replied he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better invent one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bring it without hesitation to the duke for this would be to my advantage
i composed the designs of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate and pressed the worth forward to my best ability
this being so as he was a fellow of much humour we used offered to laugh together about the great credit he had gained
i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling peas ready and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball
i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to heat my mark at two hundred cubits which cannot be done by other ways of loading
i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we made haste for rome
we have succeeded in amassing two hundred ounces of silver enough i trust to erect a handsome bronze figure
to be sure it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priest is boasting about i could live at ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose
but the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrade's thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of canna
here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in ferry boats that start as soon as some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked
when the boatmen and passengers heard the splash and saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made every effort to save him but the wind was fair in the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him
when he saw this the room feigned the utmost grief and dismay and said to his fellow passengers this priest whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron and as i happened to have business there as well we settled to travel together
now alas by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone
he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believed a story and pitied and tried to comfort him
then the roan and said to the boatman
what thank you gentlemen added he turning to the other travelers
they of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their onward journey and all with one voice agreed to what the roan and had proposed and so the matter was settled
which when at length they reached the shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the roman overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priest's luggage and putting it with his own pursued his journey to kiyoto
fortune favouring his speculations he began to amass great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself nothing and in the course of time he married a wife who bore him a child
since then all was gone well with me yet had i not been poor i had never turned assassin north thief
he would have fled into the house but the ghost stretched forth its withered arm and clutching the back of his neck scowled at him with a vindictive glare and a hideous ghastliness of mien so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear
at length undone by such ceaseless vexation took a bay fell ill and kept muttering o misery misery the wandering priest is coming to torture me
now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest who lodged in the next street
and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all over
three years ago at the cana fairy you flung me into the water and well you remember it
happily continued the priest i had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so i reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded in setting up a bronze figure to buddha thus fulfilling the wish of my heart
on my journey homewards i took a lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvelous ailment
thinking i could divine its cause i came to see you and am glad to find i was not mistaken
and would it not ill become me to bear malice
repent therefore and abandon your evil ways
to see you do so i should esteem the height of happiness
be of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that i am really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you
and a fit of madness i was tempted to kill and bio
fortune befriended me ever after but the richer i crew the more keenly i felt how wicked i had been and the more i foresaw that my victim's vengeance would some day overtake me
haunted by this thought i lost my nerve till one night i beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill
but how you manage to escape in her still alive is more than i can understand
a guilty man said the priest with a smile shudders at the rustling of the wind or the chattering of a stork speak a murderer's conscience preys upon his mind till he sees what is not
every well ordered japan is home as the old fashioned kind has its little shrine which is the centre of the religious life of the house
she it is who sets the rice and wede before the ancestral tablets who lights the little lamp each night and who sees that at each feast day in anniversary season the proper food is prepared and set out for the household gods
these must be kept carefully by the mother is is safe guarded as the many evils that beset child life
visits to noted temples by relatives and friends often result in additions to the child's collection
all these were put together by the careful mother and preserved as jealously as queen alpa kept the charred stick that governed the destiny of her son
as the children arrive at years of discretion these treasures pass out of the mother's faithful keeping into the hands of their actual owners and there usually kept scored away in some little use drawer or cabinet until death removes the necessity for any further safeguards over life

for the greater events of family life the home prophecies are felt to be too uncertain whom the services of the fortune teller must be called him
no well managed family would think of building a new house without finding in what direction to pace the front door
after this manner has been settled and the houses fairly begun there are occasional crises in its construction upon which much depends
of these the most important was the day when the roof was raised
the house owner then besides whether the day sat by the builder is a lacking one for himself and his family
a present of money teach workman is also in order and will conduce to the rapid and faithful execution of the job of man when at last the house is finished in carpenters and plasters or ready to leave it the local fireman who have assisted all along in the building as unskilled laborers often ascend to the roof and from the ridgepole cast down cakes for which the children in the neighbourhood scrambled joyfully
all come who can and those who cannot come since servants or provisions
on the day after the death often in the evening the body must be placed in the cask shaped cough u net until recently was a style commonly a news in japan
now among the wealthier classes the long coffin has superseded the small square or round one but the smaller expense connected with the burial in the old way makes a survival of an old type a necessity for the majority of japanese
at an appointed time all the relatives assemble in the death chamber and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse
there's no official ceremonial mourning of parents for their children nor does custom require them to perform any of the last rites or attend the funeral
upon the younger brothers and sisters falls the duty of attending to all the last sad ministrations
when the body has been washed as is dressed in white in sil cava te whenever the family can afford it
the body to be placed in the coffin must be folded into a sitting posture and the chin resting upon the knees the position of the mummies found in many aboriginal american tombs
this difficulty to us apparently impossible feat safely accomplished there are placed in the coffin and number of small things that the dead takes with him to the nest world
the single exception to this rule about metal is that small copper coins may be put in to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death
last of all the vacant spaces and the coffin are filled in with bags of tea
so long as the coffin is in the house it must be watched over continually
it is their duty to see that the incense burning before the coffin is never allowed to go out while the food for the dead is renewed regular intervals by the mourners themselves
there are few enlightened japanese who will defend the present system of cruelty to the afflicted or who do not long for some change but so great is the force of conservatism in this regard so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack of respect for the dead that reform advances slowly
individual instances occur in which some of the worst features of these customs are modified
a case in point is that of the late mister fu kashin a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countrymen in modern ways and who in his death continued his teaching
in his will he provided that his body was to be buried without washing in the clothing in which he died
through whose growing feeling and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies
just before the procession starts a religious ceremony is held at the house which is attended by the friends of the deceased and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery
or on the day of the burial great bunches of natural flowers are sent to the dead each bunch so large as to require the services of one man to carry it
sometimes with the gift a man is sent to take part in the procession but if the giver fields too poor to hire a man this burden too falls upon the bereaved household for etiquette requires that all flowers sent be born to the grave by uniformed coolies who march in the funeral train
another favorite present at this time among buddhists is a cage of living birds to be borne to the grave and released thereon
it seems more like a bridle than a burial
during this period the spirit of the deceased is supposed to be still inhabiting the house and a tablet or shyness set up in the death chamber before which food and flowers are renewed daily
he tarried at genesis a few days and came up the garda where i then resided he was apparently without any business that would support him but he soon became acquainted with my son thomas with whom he hunted for a long time and made his home with him at my house winter came on and he continued his day
the enraged husband well knowing that he should feel a blow if he waited to hear the order repeated instantly retreated and went down the river to his cattle
we protected the poor nick woman and gave her victuals and allan sympathized with her in her misfortunes display when her husband came to her acknowledged his former letters and that he had abused her without a cause prom mister reformation and she received him with every mark over renewal of her affection
the indians were soon answered by the american officer that the wampum was s cordially accepted and that the continuance of peace was arden cy wished for
my sant thomas went with them with allan's horse and carried the good
alleyne on finding that his enemies had gone came back to my house where he lived as before but of his return they were soon notified at niagara and nettles who married priscilla ramsay with the small party of indians came on to take him
nettles at length abandoned the chase went home and alleyne all in bathers came in
by running in the woods his clothing had become torn into rags so that he was in a suffering condition or was naked
alleyne made his trousers himself and then built a raft on which he went down the river to his own place at mount maris
there an indian gave him some refreshment and a good gun with which he hastened on to little beards down where he found his core
not daring to risk himself at that place for fear of being given up he made her but a short visit and came immediately to bardo
the love of liberty however added to his natural swiftness gave him sufficient strength to make his escape to his formal castle of safety
his pursuers came immediately to my house whereat they expected to have found him secreted and under my protection
still unsatisfied u doubting my veracity they advised my indian brother to use his influence to draw from me the secret of his concealment which they had idea that i considered great importance nor only to him but to my sense i persisted in my ignorance of his situation and finally they left me
he came to my house in the night and awoke me with the greatest caution feeling that some of his enemies might be watching to take him at a time when and in a place where it would be impossible for him to make his escape
at that time allen lay in a secret place in a gulf a short distance above my flats in a hole that he accidentally found in the rope near the river
praise little danger in this court venture so i am me as well be fled with the poor child
ah why not
my hesitated
the letter asking me to visit her was the first i have ever received from her

in one corner of the little room kenneth forbes squatted upon a pinch with an empty pine box held carelessly in his lap
while duncan worked the boy was busy with his fences but neither had spoken for a pleas a half hart
then riding slowly up the hedge bordered road his troubles once more assailed him and he wondered if there was not some spot upon the broad earth to which he could fly for retirement until the girls had left almost for good
nor rashid and he looked up to discover that he had nearly run down a pedestrian a stout little man with a bundle lumber his arm who held up one hand as it to arrest him

the boy turned away but in a moment halted again
his interest in miss jane's brother john was extraordinary

if there be an elysium nat it is this
his own daughter his only daughter of the best blood of southern aristocracy beautiful accomplished everything to secure him a splendid alliance holding nightly assignation with a horse hunter
he could well concede so much to her caprice since her staying at home could be no disadvantage to the cause that had prompted him to the stern council
it is already known that this road passed the hass sender of casa del corbo at some distance from the house and on the opposite side of the river
on reaching the corpse he dismounted led his horse in among the underwood hitched him by looping his bride grain around the topmost twigs of an elastic bow then detaching a long rope of twisted horsehair from the horn of his saddle and inserting his arm into its coil he glided out to the edge of the island on that side that lay towards the hacienda
before forsaking the shadow of the corpse he cast a glance towards the sky and at the moon sailing supremely over it
the droll conceit which has so often mused the nocturnal in avert of great cities appeared to produce a like effect upon the night patrol of the prairie and for a moment the shadow laid darkening his brow disappeared
it's not likely it is our unless it be the honour of a bad conscience who can't sleep
croft there's one such within those walls
if he be abroad there's a good chance of his seeing me on the open ground not that i should care re straw if it were only myself to be compromised
it's no use waiting upon the moon juster
it is true he had designs upon the hacienda but these did not contemplate either its cash plate or jewelry if we except the most precious jeweller contained the mistress of the mansion herself
the church bells were ringing and people on the avenue going by to service turned curious inquiring looks up at the great house and then went on talking of the recent events which had so strangely entered into and made history in the city
and all through his impassioned appeal this morning there was a note of sadness and rebuke and stern condemnation that made many of the members pale with self accusation or with inward anger
raymond had voted to continue for another year the saloon
the christians of raymond stood condemned by the results
for that had been the fact in raymond for years the saloon ruled
president march sat there his usual erect handsome firm bright self confident bearing all gone his head bowed upon his breast the great tears rolling down his cheeks unmindful of the fact that never before had he shown outward emotion in a public service
what if he had begun to do as jesus would have done long ago
when had the first church yielded to such a baptism of tears
what had become of its regular precise conventional order of service undisturbed by any vulgar emotion and unmoved by any foolish excitement
what they had been living so long on their surface feelings that they had almost forgotten the deeper weals of life
the meeting was tender it glowed with the spirit's presence it was alive with strong and lasting his off to begin a war on a whisky power and raiment that would break its rig for ever
since the first sunday when the first company of volunteers had pledged themselves to do as jesus would do the different meetings had been characterized by distinct impulses or impressions
and all through it ran one general cry for deliverance from the saloon in a awful curse
grey and his wife were besieged by inquirers who wanted to know what law's friends and acquaintances were expected to do in paying their last respects to her
gray had gone up to virginia's and after talking it over with her and maxwell the arrangement had been made
i am and always have been opposed to large public funerals said grey whose complete wholesome simplicity of character was one of its greatest sources of strength but the cry of the poor creatures who knew loreen is so earnest that i did not know how to refuse this desire to see her and pay her poor body some last little honour what do you think mister maxwell
i will be guided by your judgment in the matter
i am sure that whatever you and miss page think best will be right
under the circumstances i have a great distaste for what seems like display at such times but this seems different
it happened that that afternoon a somewhat noted newspaper correspondent was passing th great ment on his way to an editorial convention in a neighboring city
she was a common street drunkards and yet the services of the tent were as impressive as any i ever witnessed in a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen
it struck me of course being a stranger in the place with considerable astonishment to hear voices like those one naturally expects to hear only in great churches or concerts at such a meeting as this
mister maxwell spoke of the fact that the dead woman had been fully prepared to go but he spoke in a peculiarly sensitive manner of the effect of the liquor business on the lives of men and women like this one
raymond of course being a railroad town and the center of the great packing interests for this region is full of saloons
then followed what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service
it was one of the simplest and at the same time one of the most impressive sights i ever witnessed
there must have been a hundred of these women and i was told many of them had been converted at the meetings just recently
there was no answer and after one or two ineffectual attempts phronsie turned fearfully away
i'll try and she laid a quick hal the nough
two red spots burned on her cheeks and her pale blue eyes snapped
i'm sure i heard it ranging up and down
i don't want any dinner said charlotte drawing back
yes indeed said polly cheerily just as fine as can be
assuredly said old mister king with great satisfaction in polly's pleasure and at her success in drawing charlotte out
and after this there were no more quiet days for charlotte chatterton
oh b me too phronsie in pleased surprise
yes grandpapa said phronsie coming in and shutting it our carefully i came on purpose to see you all alone
so you did dear said mister king highly gratified and pushing away his writing table he held out his hand
oh no grandpapa cried phronsie in a rapture i could never be too big for that so she perched up as of old on his knee then she folded her hands and looked gravely in his face
well my dear what is it
asked the old gentleman presently you've come to tell me something i suppose
yes grandpapa i have said phronsie decidedly and it is most important too glad papa oh i do wish it so much and she clasped her hands tighter inside
well then phronsie if you want it i suppose it must be said mister king quite as a matter of course
oh she loft you everything she had phronsie a proper with millions or so it is why
charlotte poor repeated the old gentleman
why no not exactly her father is rich but charlotte i think they do very well especially as i intend to keep her here for a while and then i shall never let her suffer phronsie never indeed
grandpapa said phronsie wasn't missus chatterton au to charlotte
if missus chatterton was aunt de charlotte persisted phronsie slowly it seems as if charlotte ought to have some of the money it really does grandpapa
maybe said the old gentleman with a short laugh and i should wonder of cousin eunice was sorry over a few other things too phronsie
wouldn't it make her very glad if i gave shall met some of the money
for answer mister king set her down hastily on the floor and took two or three turns up and down the room
oh i do so wish i might she said there's so much for a little girl like me
it will be so nice to have charlotte half some with me still no answer
i was writing a note to missus fargo said phronsie putting up her lips for kiss
sure as i can be phronsie said old mister king smiling good bye dear
there there my sister's boy shall never say that but come in come in
not to be ungracious the young man three himself into a chair
i'll hang it uncle why can't you let me alone
which is a wonder interpolated pickering
i know you did uncle said pickering you've done everything that's good
for heaven's sake pickering cried his uncle darting in front of the chair and its restless och pet don't say that again
i've been a lazy dog all my life and good for nought but i hope i've not sunk to that
the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous fresh of a starry eyed flush cheeked young woman who demanded
where is he pete miss billy gasped the old man
aunt hanna's cheeks too were flushed and her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way pete had said miss billy's name
it was one matter for her to object to this thing billy was doing but quite another for pete to do it of course it's she
retorted aunt hanna testily as if you yourself d bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night pete where is he
interposed billy tell mister bertram i'm here or wait i'll go right in in surprise it
pete had recovered himself by now but he did not even glance toward aunt hannah
miss billy miss billy you're an angel straight from heaven you are you are oh i'm so glad you came
it'll be all right now all right he's the den miss billy
billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall aunt hanna's indignant voice arrested her billy stopped
pete go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receive us pete's lips twitched
but his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke
a flying figure brushed by him and fell on its seas by the couch with a low cry bertram's eyes flew open
don ling found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over bertram's tray
in the hall above aunt hannah was crying into william's gray win and duster that hung on the hall rack aunt hannah's handkerchief was on the floor back at hillside
then very gradually it dawned over them that there was after all something strange and unexplained in it all
as if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closer bertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable
why of course stammered billy i couldn't help thinking that maybe you had found out you didn't want me
demanded bertram angry a mystified
as for my not painting again you didn't understand pete deary
she pulled herself half away from bertram's in circling arm
billy dere quivering sigh
good heavens is kate and this too bertrand's voice was savage now
well she brought a letter
billy laughed gayly but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes
and you never did think for a minute billy that she cared for him
he had not been slow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids
billy was so glad bertram returned the question on her love instead of arkwright
after a minute billy stirred and sighed happily
you see i wasn't in love with mister arkwright
an and you didn't care speciall be for for miss went up
billy put a soft finger on his lips
bertram kissed the finger and subsided hoop he commented
well what is that is that kate too demanded bertram grimly
there was another silence then suddenly bertram stirred
billy i'm going to marry you to morrow he announced decisively
i don't know as i can trust you out of my sight till then you'll read something or hear something or get a letter from kate after breakfast tomorrow morning that'll set you saving me again and i don't want to be saved that way
i'm going to marry you to morrow i'll get he stopped short with a sudden frown confound that law i forgot
five days indeed sir
i wonder if you think i can get ready to be married in five days
don't want you to get ready retorted bertram promptly i saw marie it ready and i had all i wanted of it
if you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace ruffling will do it afterwards not before but
besides i need you to take care of me cut in bertram craftily
the tender glow on billy's face told its own story and bertram's eager eyes were not slow to read it
sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm
billy my dear
it was aunt hannah's plaintive voice at the doorway a little later
we must go home and william is here too and wants to see you
you mean it'll be before october
aunt hanna glanced from one to the other uncertainly
yes nodded billy demurely
yes i know that is a good while cut in bertram marly
we wanted it to morrow what we had to wait on account of the new license law
yet so strong was the effect upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectation of the wood which should make him rich
a part of that impression was due to the engagement which he must now fulfil
to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes
because in his salad days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many charms step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that raw attachment
unable to think of work he left the house and wandered gloomily about reach it's park
he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marion who was fate's instrument
he wrote to marian
will you let me hear or come and see
i scarcely thought of beforn is likely to kill himself
but why the chuse did he go all the way out there
i hoped he would bring me some yews
poverty i can only suppose
but i will see wh dale i hadn't come across beeton for a long time
was he still so very poor
asked amy compassionately
i'm afraid sire his book failed utterly
oh if i had imagined him still in such distress surely i might have done something to help you
perchance his death was in part attributable to that hopeless love
he sent me a copy of his novel she said and i saw him once or twice after that
having this subject to converse upon put the two more quickly at ease than could otherwise have been the case
amy might take a foremost place about baily women
especially now that her father is threatened with blindness
is it so serious
even if mister yule recovers his side it is not at all likely that he will be able to work as before
our difficulties a so grave that
he paused and let his hand fail despondently
i have a good deal of will you remember and what i have set my mind upon no doubt i shall some day achieve
there was silence
the last three years he continued have made no slight difference in my position
recall where i stood when you first knew be
just now i am in need of a little encouragement
you don't notice any falling off in my work recently
do you see my things in the current and so on generally
sometimes i believe i have detected you when there was no signature
her storing in that girl's paper has attracted attention
and i could so easily put her rest by renouncing all claim upon her
i surmise that that you yourself would also be put rest by such a decision
john look at me with that ironical smile he pleaded
i couldn't go about declaring that i was heartbroken in any event i must be contempt for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgments are pretty sure to be unfavorable what can i do
the case is too delicate by fear for my advice
well i'll go back to my scrip
again just beheld the white soft handed for a superfluous moment
yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry
barin could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companions smooth countenance
she had divined that there were some grave reason for this sons and the painting with which she approached was half caused by the anxious beats of her heart
he began abruptly
he gave her such details as he had obtained then added
there are two of my companions fallen in the battle
i ought to think myself a lucky fellow marrying what
you had better fitted to fight your way jasper
more of a brute we mean
here no very well i don't
i have made up my mind about our affairs he went on presently
gifts
will you marry them and let us take their chance
you feel yourself indispensable to your father at present
i should be so afraid of the effect upon his health jasper
she paused and looked up at him touchingly
dear i can't feel it would be my duty to renounce you because my father had become blind
has one thing occurred to you
will he consent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is missus mordan
and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him
she listened anxiously and reflected
as i have said there is a very serious doubt whether your father would accept money for you when you are my wife
it isn't your fault marian and well then there's only one thing to do
except jasper that if father is helpless i must find means of assuring his support
d you think them insurmountable
that is just what i have decided his impossible narrowing you shall have the plain truth
i don't trust myself
but shall you face them daringly
put up your umbrella marian
what do i care for a drop of reign she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is at stake how am i to understand you
every word you speak seems intended to dishearten me
why need you conceal it if that is the truth
is that what you mean by sighing you distrust yourself
we must see each other again marian
how am i to live an hour in such uncertainty as this
i do wish it
her emotion had an effect on him and his voice trembled
there is no natural wore that a child should surrender everything for her parents
you know so much more of the world than i do can't you advise me
is there no way of provoking from my father
good god this is frightful marian i can't stand it
i will be faithful to you
he had made a pretence of holding his umbrella over her but marian turned away and walked to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a great tree her face averted from him
moving to follow he saw that her frame was shaken by soundless sobbing
in what can there be more selfishness
but i couldn't say a word that would seem to invite such misery as this
you don't love me jasper at that an end of everything
happiness or misery come to us by fight
is it in my power to make you happy
but if you had said you loved me before that i should have it always to remember
if i believe anything i believe that i did love you
what can you say to me more than you have said now
remember me as a man who disregarded priceless loves such as yours to go and make himself a proud position among fools and knaves indeed that one's come to
soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merited my perverse pride would revolt against it
what can be simpler than the truth
it is a thing that happens every day either in a man or woman and all what honour demands is the courage to confess the truth
marian will you do this will you let her engagement last for another sixth months but without her meeting during that time
that seems to me childish
the rain fell unceasingly and with it began to mingle an autumnal mist
jess but delay a moment then asked calmly
are you going to the museum yes
don't home again for this morning marian you can't work
i must and i have no time to lose
good bye she gave him her hand
they looked at each other for an instant then marian left the shelter of the train opened her umbrella and walked quickly away
jasper did not watch her he had the face of a man who was suffering a severe humiliation
his sister said very little for she recognized genuine suffering in his times an aspect
a few weeks ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest affection but who is very rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him
yesterday morning he received her final answer a refusal
you will understand th surely you need no fresh proof how utterly unworthy he is of you
you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you
several days passed before there came a reply
i must only ask that you will write to me without the least reference to these troubles tell me always about yourself and be sure that you cannot tell me too much
we had then but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of the confident which was requisite for determination of the problem
several different parties were therefore organised to examine the various routes supposed to be practicable within the northern end southern limits of the united states
the only discrimination mate was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the surveys
he inquiries were made with regard to gunpowder which subsequently led to the use of a coarser reign for artillery
the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in the service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil wife
under instructions from the president the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution
after some further discussion of the question the visitors withdrew dissatisfied with the result of the interview
a quartermaster general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake at the appointee to the office had been confounded with his father who was a well known whig but that he the son was a democrat
i assured the general that this was altogether immaterial adding that it was a very pretty quarrel as it stood and that i had known a desire to effect a settlement of it on any inferior issue
nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the foxhound are very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size
if you want to hunt your areas on foot sixteen inches is quite big enough almost too big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches is a useful height or even nineteen inches
it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule asked color it is so much a matter of individual taste
but puppies are usually sent out to walk and may easily be procured to be captain reared until they are old enough to be hindered to their work
he has of course finer but with the length of neck so perfect in the bigger hound the little shoulders of the same pattern and the typical quarters and second flies
and when he is fairly on a line of course he sticks to it as the saying is like a beagle
it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otter hound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of good eighteen inches and an almost identical contemporary that was called the essex beagle
that a great many of the true order were bred became very man affairs as soon as the harrier and beagle association was formed and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hound show was reserved for the
then they seemed to sprinkle every part of the country
one hears now of the carstone the housed place very noted indeed the hal toon the lee park the stoke place the edinburgh the surbiton the trinity foot the wood dale missus eudocia hilliard missus prices and missus turners

all things which follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of god must always exist and be infinite or in other words are each carnal and infinite through the said attribute
proof conceive if it be possible supposing the proposition to be denied that something in some attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of the said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought
in its nature infinite
must necessarily exist
we have now granted therefore thought not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of god does not naturally follow from its nature can so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of god which is against our apotheosis
and beyond the limits of the duration of the idea of god supposing the latter at some time not to have existed for not to be going to exist thought would perforce have existed without the idea of god which is contrary to our hypothesis for we suppose that thought being given the idea of god necessarily flowed therefrom
bear in mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from god's absolute nature
corollary hence it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is ins classic phraseology god is cause of the being of things as sandy rem
corollary individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of god or modes by which the attributes of god are expressed in a fixed and definite manner
such o cour such a time you never did see
i was wishing somebody would give the conversation a start when indian made a break
this ain't no great stock country says he to the old gentleman with the can

never mind polly said jasper there's all next summer and after our winter and dresden and all our hard work over music would u be fine those of jaunt round again and his eyes glistened
and you'll go on drawing and painting till you get to be a great artist ring on polly enthusiastically and then we'll see something you've done and the loose maybe the loo cried adela oh dear me polly pepper
tom selwyn had been very sober during all this merry chatter and now in his seat across the narrow aisle he drummed his heels impatiently on the floor
what's up little mother asked tom in surprise at her unusual manner its doss this tom
when the news was circulated as it was pretty soon that the party was not to be broken into it all till paris was a completed story the jubilation was such as to satisfy even tom
oh isn't it oates peas beans and barley girl cried polly as they watched them intently
and his long arm went out and picked a jack an end of an urchin who incautiously regarding such quiet travellers as not worth minding had hovered too near while trying to tease the girls
and presently a woman came and took little blue pin afore off and then the rest of the girls unclasped their hands and the ring melted away and the game was over
i'm glad the girl's over here half fun said polly as grandpapa and his party moved off isn't it nice to think they do
two or three days of rest at martini put everyone in good shape and gave them all a bit of time to pick up on many little things that were behindhand
that's my third letter polly announced jasper on the other side of the table now i'm going to begin on jules
one two said polly counting why i thought i'd written three while this one is most finished jasper
deare said tom delighted to think that no terrible result had really ensued from his words that after they were out had scared him mightily
i'll posts too polly give them here
then his face brightened and he said and she's right polly while polly fished or bragged out of jew's little money bag that hung in her belt
do get the stamps please jasper and put them on and he took up her two letters and she gave the bag a little pat for jewels sake wishing it was his stubby black hair that her fingers could touch
i don't know where we are going to get nice white paper far around robin said polly leaning her alps on the table and her chin in her hands i know ejaculated tom whirling on his heel and dashing out
i want polly too said phronsie wriggling away from the pen that polly held out alluringly
phronsie who hadn't heard what polly said her small head being full of the responsibility of beginning the important letter and considering since it was to be done it was best to have it over with as soon as possible felt a scribbling a letters as fast as she could all them running downhill
it's all right grandi ad i'll like it he said
i tell you you don't know my grandaddy he's got lots of fun in him he added
i won't cry anymore declared phronsie wiping off the last tear trailing down the nose
then i shall be all as well as ever said polly kissing the wet little face
we must put in little pictures said polly trying to make herself cheery as the work went busily on
polly you always do think of the best things exclaimed jasper beaming at her which made her try harder than ever to smile
i wouldn't feel so badly polly he managed to a spur when phronsie was absorbed with her work fell i could probably just as father did the chin bad boy
he seems to accomplish something every time he goes observed jasper drily hello just look at him now
oh dear me exclaimed adela as her scissor slipped now you've draggled the table again then she caught polly's eye
rather not much obliged tom bobbed his thanks
picture after picture cut from railroad dyed books illustrated papers and it seemed to jasper gathered as if by magic with cunning little photographs broke up the letter and wound in and out with funny and charming detail with some of their journey
the rest of it is nice whispered jasper and they ventured to say that i'll like that the best of all
mister king thought so too and he beamed it phronsie so you did he cried now that's fine i wish you'd write me a letter some time
but what can i do so small and stupid and shy as i am
i must find some way to give the little ones a ice christmas
tom'll like to have me go with him and sing while he places harp in the streets
yes i will try and then if i do well the little one shall have a merry christmas
but see then it is cold in the streets the wind bites and the snow freezes one's fingers
she thanked tom and ran away to get ready for she felt sure her father would not please her anything
then she washed out little rance's frock and put it to dry because she would not be able to do it the next day
she longed to make the beds and dress the children overnight she was in such a hurry to have all in order but as that could not be she sat down again and tried over all the songs she knew
when she had told her plan peter bardi shook his head and thought it would never do but tessa thank so hard he consented at last that she should try it for one a week and sent her to bet the happiest little girl in the york
as soon as her father was gone tessa flew about and put everything in nice order telling the children she was going out for the day and they were to mind tom was mother who would see about the fire and the dinner for the good woman left tessa and entered into her little plans with all her heart
poor tess's heart beat fast as she trudged away with tom oak who slung his hart over his shoulder and gave her his hand
it was rather a dirty hand but so kind that tessa clung to it and kept looking up at the friendly brown face for encouragement
see now have no fear give them bell monica that is marian will make the laugh whispered tommo tuning his hark
when paddled frenchman nodded to her and it seemed to help her very much for she began to sing before she thought and that was the hardest part of it
but too shook if curly hat and answered soberly yes i took you there first for they love music and are off our country but up among the great houses we shall not always do well
but she had made half a dollar for tum of divided and money fairly and she felt rich with her share
her hands were covered with chilblains where she had no mittens but she had put them under her shawl and shuffled merrily away in her big boots feeling so glad that the week was over and nearly three dollars safe in her pocket
how gave the streets were that day
how brisk everyone was and how bright the faces looked as people trotted about with big baskets holly wreaths and young evergreens going to blossom into splendid christmas trees
but i can't so i'll fill the socks all full and be happy said tessa as she looked wistfully into the gay stores and saw the heavy baskets go by
who knows what may happen if we do well returned tommo nodding wisely for he had plan as well as tessa and kept chuckling over it as he trudged through the mud
will try one more street and then go home thou'rt so tired little one
at the fourth some people let them sing all their songs and gave nothing
tessa felt so grateful that without waiting for tommo she sang her sweetest little song all alone
i ask mamma said rose and away she went into the dinning room close by
as the door opened tessa saul what looked to her like a fairy feast all silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine and tall glass pitchers and smoking dishes that smelt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfaction
ah yes i shall come with much gladness and play us never in my life before cried tommo with the flourish of the old cap that made the children laugh
give these to your brothers said the fairy prince stuffing nuts and oranges and to tests hands
ah so kind so very kind i have no way to say thank you but runs as shall be for you a heavenly angel and i will sing my heart out for your treat cried chester folding the mittens as if she would sayer prayer of thankfulness if she knew how
she got up early to see if the socks were all right and there she found the most astonishing sight
four socks instead of three and by the fourth pinned out quite elegantly was a little dress evidently meant for her o warm woolen dress all made and actually with bright buttons on it
tessa screamed and danced in her delight and up tumbled all the children to scream and dance with her making a regular carnival in it small scale
in her long stocking she found all sorts of treasures for tome had stuffed it full of queer things and his mother had made gingerbread into every imaginable shape from fat pigs to full omnibuses
little rouse was accepted with delight by the kind lady of her children and nestle learn the song quite easily
arose from the crowded children gathered to the festival
before they went home the kind mamma told tess she should be her friend and gave her motherly kiss which warm the child's heart and seemed to set a p seal upon that promise

so odd were they by the presence of a living united states senator that during three minutes not a spit ball was thrown
after that they began to come to themselves by degrees and presently the spell was wholly gone and they were reciting verses and pulling hair
the usual sunday school exercises were hurried through and then the minister got up in board the house with a speech built on the customary sunday school plan then the superintendent put in his oar then the town dignitaries had their say
am i am some populous centre of my own country where the choicest children of the land have been selected and brought together as at a fair for a prize no
then where am i yes where am i
my soul is lost in wonder at the thought
earth has no higher no grander position for me
then what is it what did my consciousness reply
ah think of that now i could hardly keep the tears back i was so grateful
they could not give him a costly education but they were good and wise and they sent him to the sunday school he loved the sunday school
i hope you love your sunday school ah i see by your faces that you do that is right
always love your teachers my children for they love you more than you can know now
and by and by the people made him governor and he said it was all owing to the sunday school
why the people gave him a towering illustrious position a grand imposing position
it was senator of the united states
that poor little boy that loved his sunday school became that man that man stands before you
above all things my children be honest
when cent or dilworthy departed from cattle bille he left three dozen boys behind him arranging a campaign of life whose subjective point was the united stat senate
we latch go is a delightful child
there was no other such child there never had been and there never would be
violet's mother ser female alexandrovna was sure of that
loch his eyes were dark and large her cheeks are rosy her lips were made for kisses and for laughter
but it was not these charms in l lech gut that gave her mother the keenest joy
she felt cold with her husband
he was always fresh and cool with a frigid smile and wherever he passed cold currents seemed to move in the air
it even seemed that spa alexandrovna that she was in love with her future husband and this made her happy
the bride was also good looking she was a tall dark eyed dark haired girl somewhat to made but very tactful
he had connections and his wife came a good influential people
this might at the proper opportunity prove useful
after their marriage there was nothing in the manner of sara lowestoft to suggest anything wrong to his wife
later however when his wife was about to have a child sergey wostov established connections elsewhere of a light and temporary nature
ser fena alexandrovna found the such and to her own astonishment was not particularly hur she awaited her infant with a restless anticipation that swallowed every other feeling
spa alexandrovna drifted farther and farther away from him
l lotta then ran away standing with her plump little legs over the carpets and hid herself behind the curtains near her bed
where is my baby girl the mother asked if she looked for l latch ga may believe that she did not see her
then she came out a little farther and her mother as though she had only just caught sight of her seized her by her little shoulders and exclaimed joyously here she is my loa
her mother's eyes glowed with passionate emotion
her mother went to hide
thole ga turned away as though not to see but watch trim mocha stealthily all the time
where is mamma mocha as la let ga
a smile of absolute bless played on her red lips
lul thatch goes getting nearer her mother's corner
her mother was growing more absorbed every moment by her interest in the game her heart beat with short quick strokes and she pressed even closer to the wall disarranging her hair still more
loretta suddenly glanced toward her mother's corner and screamed with joy
through the half closed doors he heard the laughter the joyous outcries the sound of romping
even fedosya felt abashed now for her mistress now for herself
he liked coming here where everything was beautifully arranged this was done by seraphim alexandrovna who wished to surround her little girl from her very infancy only with the loveliest things
seraph ma alexandrina dressed herself tastefully this too she did for l latch go with the same end in view
one thing sergey modo had not become reconciled to and this was his wife's almost continuous presents in the nursery
it's just as i thought i knew that i'd find you here he said with a deserving condescending smile
merely you see that the child should feel its own individuality he explained in answer to seraphim ma out senna a's puzzled plants
she's still so little said seraphim ma alexandrovna
i don't insist it's your kingdom here
i think it over his wife answered smiling as he did coldly but genially
then they began to talk with something else
that the mistress does it while that's one thing but that the young lady does it that's bad
why asked fedosya of curiosity
this expression of curiosity gave her face the look of a wooden roughly painted doll
yes that's bad repeated agatho of conviction terribly bad well
it's the truth i'm saying remember my words agafya went on with the same assurance and secrecy
it's the sheerest sign
the old woman had invented this sign quite suddenly herself and she was evidently very proud of it
madame madame she said quietly in a trembling voice
seraphim ma alexandrovna gave a start
p doc's face made her anxious
what is it fedosya she asked with great concern is there anything wrong with ll ca
no madam said fedosya she gesticulated with her hands to reassure her mistress and to make her sit down
but match does asleep may god be with her
only you'd like to say something you see well munch giv always hiding herself that is not good
i can't tell you how bad it is said fedosya and her face expressed the most decided confidence
i understand nothing of what you are saying
you see madam ms a kind of omen explains fedosya abruptly and a shamefaced way
nonsense said seraphim alexandrovna
who told you all this as seraphim alexandrovna in in austere low voice
no exclaimed ser female alexandrovna irritation as though she wished to protect herself somehow from the sudden anxiety
what nonsense as though the lunch good could die
she saw clearly that there could be no possible connection between a child's quite ordinary diversion and the continuation of the child's life
she made a special effort that evening to occupy her mind with other matters but her thoughts turn and voluntaries the fact that wilt love to hide herself
when the lunch ga was still quite small and had learned to distinguish between her mother and her nurse she sometimes sitting in her nurse's arms made a sudden rugg ish grimace and hid her laughing face and the nurse's shoulder
then she would look out with a sly glance
though she reproached herself at once for this unfounded superstitious dread nevertheless she could not under wholeheartedly into the spirit while latch bea's favorite game and she tried to divert lulu's attention to something else
she eagerly complied with their mother's new wishes
seraph ma alexandrovna tried desperately to amuse cloth ga
perhaps thou seraph ma alexandrovna she is not as strongly drawn to the world as other children who attracted by many things
if this is so is it not a sign of organic weakness
serf mout syro una herself began the game once or twice though she played it with a heavy heart
she suffered as though committing an evil deed with full consciousness
it was a sad day for seraph alexandrovna
her mother covered her with a blue blanket
lil loth ca drew her sweet little hands from under the blanket and stretched the main embrace her mother her mother bent down
she seemed so small and so frail under the pointed that covered her
ser paa alexandrovna remained standing over luck's bed a long while and she kept looking at w latch ga with tenderness and fear
i'm a mother is it possible that i shouldn't be able to protect her she thought as she imagined various ills that might befal loth ka
she prayed long that night but the prayer did not relieve her sadness
several days passed will lunch h caught cold
the fever came upon her at night
when seraphim ma alexandrovna awakened by fedosya came to lunch gun saw her looking so hot so restless and so tormented she instantly recalled the evil omen and a hopeless dispirited possession of her from the first moments
a doctor was called and everything was done that as usual on such occasions but the inevitable happened
and the latch grew feebler from hour tow
nothing made her so unhappy as the reiteration of fedosya uttered between sobs she hid herself and hid herself are elexa
fever was consuming role ga and there were times when she lost consciousness and spoke in delirium
three days passed torturing like a night man
ser forma alexandrovna hid her face behind the curtains near latch bea's bed how tragic
a wait mocha whispered woloda
mom much's white face became blurred and everything grew dark before loa
she met her husband
spa alexandrovna was standing by the coffin and looking dully at her dead child
sea my dear don't agitate yourself said sergeant mallow savage in a whisper
you must resign yourself to your fate
she'll be up in a minute persisted ser remi alexandrovna her eyes fixed on the dead little girl
sergey lovest looked round him cautiously he was afraid of the unseemly and of the ridiculous
see don't agitate yourself he repeated
he was confused and annoyed
her face seemed tranquil and her eyes were dry
she went into the nursery and began to walk round the room looking into those places where lala used to hide herself
she walked all about the room and bent now and then to look under the table or under the bed and kept on repeating cheerfully where's my little one where is my loath ga
after she had walked round the room once she began to make her quest in you
fedosya motionless with dejected face sat in a corner and looked frightened at her mistress and she suddenly burst out sobbing and she wailed loudly
she hid herself and hid herself are the lunch gar at angelic little soul
when she entered the parlor there were several people between her and lotta
there was an oppressive feeling of heaviness and seraph in alexandrovna's head as she approached ll ga
well much go lay there still and perle and smile pathetically
the little one did not reply
seraphim alexandrovna stood up erect sight in a lost way smiled and called loudly wale ga
while much goes being carried out
captain bol the commander of a small garrison at see brook permitted him to land but when the governor began to read his commission bull ordered him to be silent
what has happened mister prince was worth asked for he could see that the man was greatly excited governor andrews has come again gasped mister prince why should that alarm us the fellow though given to boasting is not dangerous or liable to point his threats into execution but he has grown dangerous declared mister prince the liberties of the coloni involved
captain wadsworth became a little uneasy though he was still inclined to treat the matter lightly
we have surely refused to yield our charter voluntarily for it is the guardian of our political rights
that is true cup and wadsworth continued mister prince and to subdue our stubbornness this b story has come to hartford with sixty earlmen to demand the surrender of the charter in person
captain was bounded to his feet in a rage and placing his hand on the hilt of his sword declared he shall not have it
the day was well nice spent when he arrived and the members were engaged in a heated debate on a subject of the utmost importance
he consented however to await the discussion but as soon as it was ended he declared that he would have the charter
after that captain had taken two or three turns across the room he paused the mast
what what is the assembly doing engaged in debate
and will he wait until it ended he has promised to do so
mister prince fixed his amazed eyes on the captain's face and read their desperate determination captain he began
mister prince bowed and hastily returned to the house where the assembly was in session
as soon as he was gone charles stan said
yes charles you will answer what do you mean uncle
never did the beaters take greater interest in a minor subject
what do you intend doing uncle will you fight then
remember the worth must be done right at the time not too soon nor too late
the sun was setting and the captain said
come charles let us hasten to the assembly
by no means but i want you to be fully impressed with the seriousness of your mission
take your place charles and be prepared to do your part whispered captain wadsworth
charles god is close to the long table used by the secretaries is possible without attracting special attention
the discussion went on darkness came and four lighted candles were placed on the table in two set on a shelf on the wall
those two candles on the wall were a great annoyance to charles until he saw a man stat near them
though the lights were extinguished through the window the faint starlit dimly illuminated the scene
he followed him as rapidly as he could
the youth was cloth behind him and when they were outside used his arm
o i had a care how you approached me
the soldiers began the crowd about the house when at a signal from capting wadsworth the trainbands came on the scene and prepared to grapple with the soldiers
where is the charter
you have your soldiers at the door and we have the trainbands of connecticut ready to defend us against violence
who of you has the charter
it was the boy ching range governor
every member of the assembly shook their heads
we do not know him he does not living communicate where does he live
little did the captain or his youthful assistant dream that their simple act would make the old tree historic
the tree in which the doc mate was hitting was ever afterwards known as charter oak
it remained vigor bearing fruit every year u tittle a little after midnight august eighteen fifty sixth when it was prostrated by a heavy storm of wind
when the order from the seizure of the charters was first made known the assembly auroral and sent a most loyal agis to the king sang
he formerly dissolved the assembly broke the seal of the colony which bore the figure of an anchor and the word hope and made it five in the inhabitants into his legislative council and assumed the function of governor but he did not take away the parchment on which the charter was written
which from that time until the fourth union of the colonies for mutual defense at the bursting out the friends in indian war the inhabitants of rhode island or their share in the defensive efforts especially when the hostile savages hung along their fronts in new york like an ill omened cloud
the history is that commonwealth is identified with that of all new england from the beginning of king william's war soon after to the expulsion of andrews
colbert who had heard his uncle getting ready to run down to the water's edge
it's a schooner said mister bingham to mister miner and shee a very heavy cargo
to this cord was fastened a heavy rope or table
what's that board for as spirt as he saw a board following the teale
that's the directions said how
they are printed in a number of languages and they tell the crew to carry the end of the key will hi up to mast and fasten it strongly there
oh i see said berg the lan will stretch then and the breeches booley will go out on a polly
it was clear day nail and much of the wicked storm had passed
with the daylight king girls and women to the beach
missus bobbsey missus minturn nellie and her mother besides dorothy at nan were all there flossie and freddy being obliged to stay home with dinah and susan
of course the girls asked all sorts of questions and burton hal tried to answer them as best they could
it seemed a long time before any movement of the cable showed that the buy was returning
nearer and nearer it came until now a man's head could be seen
the girls and women were too frightened to talk and nellie clung close to her mother
a big roller dashing and finished the work for the lice birds and a man in the corso banded upon shore
everybody gathered around and nelly with a strange face and a stranger hope broke through the crowd to see the receded man
oh it is my father's she screamed falling right into the arms of the drenched man
but the half drained man rubbed his eyes as if he could not believe them then the next minute he pressed his little daughter to his heart unable to speak a word
and as george bring him out there anxiously asked the brother
safe and well came the welcome answer
i guess our prayers were heard last night
here comes another man exclaimed the people as this time a big man dashed on sands
while i declare we did a land on a friendly shore
just as mister bingham said though lie saving work turned out to be a social affair for there was a great time greeting nell's father in how's uncle
and how on his father too put in man
what a morning that was it sunset beach
i'm so glad we prayed said little flossie to pretty when she heard the good news
a beautiful day had grown out of the dreadful storm
and everybody was so happy
the neptune the vessel that had struck on the sand far was now safely anchored near shore and the sailors came in and out in rowboats back and forth to land just as they wished
then we had to go back to work at the logs went on the captain and then one of our crew took a fever
that was what galena so
finally we had every wall glowed on the schooner and we started off
we counted on daring home last week when this last storm struck us and drove us out of our course
about the value asked mister bobbsey who was downed from the city
the value repeated the captain aside so that the strangers may not hear
while i am a rich man now and so is my mate mc g ruin for that wood was contracted for by largest and richest piano firm in this country and now it is all but delivered to them and the money in our she hands
yes indeed it would have taken us a lifetime to king late as much money as we have earned in the shear
maybe aunt emily will take you down to the city on her shopping tour suggested nan
he made the clerks and move all the trucks from the isles and i guessed everybody was glad the army fell down
the wonderful fresh air that these men lived in night and day had brightened their eyes too so that even the plainest feast and the most awkward man among them was as nimble as an athlete from his perfect exercise
i don't know how to say good by to you nellie told dorothy and m next morning
oh that will be splendid declared nan
you are quite rich now aren't you remarked dorothy
and dorothy went up and down on the room like the pictures of cinderella's proud sisters
and we will be on hand thank you replied the joking dorothy
come nellie called missus maclaughlan i'm ready where's your hat
we might be able to manage that too nelly told him
my uncle is a fireman and he can take us through his engine house
most of them i guess answered burke
well we have had a good vacation and i'm willing to go to work again
so am i declared man vacation was just long and that i think
mister bobbsey was down from the city of course to take the family home and now all hands even freddy and flossie were busy packing up
there were the shells to be looked after the fish nets besides downy the duck and smooth the cat
and so our little friends had spent all their vacation
his characters get john called a mad with jealousy of fallen epileptic fits all rave hysterically
if dostoevsky had had less vision he would have been strindberg
like them he is a novelist of torture
certainly the last of cruelty the lusted destruction for destruction's sake is the most conspicuous of the deadly sins in dostoevsky's men and women
he may not be a cruel author
but they are never in balance they are always in demoniac or complete
even the last is never hardly ever the last of a more or less sane man
dostoevsky could not have described the sin of nekhludoff in resurrection
this is a madhouse cries some un insidious
one result of this is a multiplicity of action
even the talk is actions more than ideas
he saw his violent deeds not with the hand but with the suck
but one had noticed during this last two days that the other was wearing a silver watch on a yellow bead chain which he seems not to have seen on him before
he took a knife and when his friend had turned away he approached him cautiously from behind took aim turned his eyes heavenwards crossed himself and praying fervently god forgive me for christ's sake
he never paints every man he always projects dostoevsky or a night nara dostoevsky
that is why crim and punishment belongs to a lower range of fiction thane karenina or fathers and sons
we sympathize indeed with the fears the bravado the despair that succeed the crime
he is a grotesque made alive by sheer imaginative intensity in passion
one does not grudge an artist and abnormal character or two
he invented vicious grates as thickened evince comic greatest
was very formed of hanging cuts and burying them with great ceremony
as for the karamazovs themselves he betrays the old father and the eldest of his sons hating each other and fighting like brutal maniacs
serve him right shouted dmitri breathlessly
if i haven't killed him i'll come again and kill him
it is easy to see where dostoevsky has become a popular author
no melodramatic ever poured out incident upon the stage from such a horn of plenty
dostoevsky is always ready to show them all in at once
on two opposite pages of the idiot one finds the following characters brought in by name general a puncheon prince s ad a leda ivanovna lizaveta procopius yevgeny pavlovitch r dons ky princess billiards ski a glare prince miskin coiled vulcan ippolit vara fer schenk nastasya philipovna nina alexandrovna guna titan n general e vulcan
but the secret of dostoevsky's appeal is something more than the multitude and thrill of his incidents and characters
mister murray ball did faces the difficulty and attempts to definition
to him dulse sky's work is the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life it is more than a record of a struggle it is for struggle itself
and those voices take shape in certain unforgettable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly mean tavern certain surrounding darkness
ultimately they are the creations not of a man who desired to be but of a spirit which sought to know
because they have possessed they are no longer men and women
this is all in a measure true
to say this is not to deny the spirit of content of dust es is work the anguish of the imprisoned souls at battles with doubt and denial and despair
there is in dostoevsky a suggestion of caliban trying to discover some better god than sir tables
the ultimate attitude of dostoevsky is as christian as the apostle peter's lord i believe helped th mine unbelief
and beyond the dark night of suffering and dissipating the night rose sky still seized the light of christian compassion
or even by the compassion of others like prince miskin in the idiot
his work like his face bears the mark of this terrible conflict
the novels of the perfect image of the man
as to the man himself the vicomte dees baggy described him as he saw him in the last years of his life
when he became excited on a certain point one could have sworn that one had seen him before seated i bench in a police court awaiting trial or among vagabonds who passed their time begging before the prison doors
at all other times he carried that look of sad and gentle meekness seen on the images of old saving saints
thus a portrait of the men one sees behind austere sky's novels the portrait one might almost have inferred from the novels
it is a figure that it once fascinates and repels
he is not by temperamental singer
his music is a still small voice unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and storm
truth to tell mister hardy is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet
he does not express life easily in beautiful words or in images
thus he writes in i found her out there of one who
there could not be an ugly and more prosaic suguration that is contained in the image in the last line
and prose intrudes in the choice of words as well as in images
take for example these of the word domiciled in the passage in the same palm about
when we as strangers sought their catering care veiled smiles bespoke their thought of what we were
catering care is an appalling phrase
is a line of good poetry
you did not come and marching time drew on and warm me numb yet lost for loss of your dear presence there than that i thus found lacking in your make that higher compassion which can overbear reluctance for pure loving kindness sake grieve die when is the hobo strok it some you did not come
there are hints of the grand style of lyric poetry in these lines but phrases lurk in your make and as the hope hour stroked its some a discords the brett tumbling to the levels of victorian commonplace
he has a temperament sensitive beyond that of all but a few recent writers to the pain and passion of human beings
one can remember palm after pole of his with a theme that might easily have served for mister hardy too late christina the lost mistress the last ride together the statue and the bust to name a few
but what a sense of triumph there is in brownie's tragedies
his wor is a place of opulence not of poverty
to have loved in for an hour is with browning to live forever after in the inheritance of a mighty achievement
to have loved for an hour ears in mister hardy's imagination to have deepened the sadness even more than the beauty of one's memories
for then i u distressed by hearts growing cold to me could only wait my embers rest with equanimity
but time to make me grieve part steals lets part abide and shakes this fragile frame at eve with throbbings of noontide
and despair is by no means triumphant in what is perhaps the most attractive of all mister hardy's ponds the oxen
we pictured the meek mild creatures where they dwelt in this story pen nor did it occur to one of us there to doubt o'er kneeling then
the mode of faith however or rather of delight in the memory of faith is not mister haidee's prevailing mood
he can enter upon a wall without ironical doubts as we see in the song men who march away
how long he cries in a poem written some years ago
when shall the sen of softer policies whereof we dream have sway in each proud land and patriotism grown god lack scorned to stand bondslave to realms but circle earth and seas
but perhaps his characteristic attitude to wars to be found not in lines like these but in that melancholy poems the souls of the slain in which the souls of the dead soldiers return to their country in question as senior soul flame was to how their friends and realities have kept their doughty deeds in remembrance
and general held hold out her sweethearts sworn loyal as doves
some fickle in fleet hearts have found the new loaves
and our wives quoth another resignedly dough they on our deeds
mister hardy has tree bitter a sense reality to believe much in the glory of war
the real world to mister hardy is the world of ancient human things in which war has come to be a hideous irrelevance
it may be thought on the other hand that mister hardy's palms about war are no more expressive of tragic futility than his poems about love
futility and frustration are ever requiring themes in both
his lovers like his soldiers brought in a grey defeated of their glory
lovers are always severed both in life and in death
in beyond the last lamp we have the same mournful cry o the severance
no shade of penn cool are tree or tower while earth and jews will fall on my mound and writ in the hour steal unto yours one women never haunt are two green coverts
they bring us face to face with an experienced intenser that our own
nothing of tiniest worth have i wrought pondered planned no one thing asking blame or praise since the pale corpselike birth of this diurnal unit bearing blanks in all its rays dullest of dull heeded days
it's a sad thing for a body to lack brains when she warns to be a teacher isn't it
penelope has studied so hard or winter and she hasn't gone anywhere gold the other sister wistfully
doris dreamed of pretty dresses all that night and thoth about them all the next day
so it must be confessed the penelope though she would not have ad might it it for the word
she knew that penelope had startled out to say a new dress
doris hunter i believe it's an old quilled
listened penelope my dear doris
love to penelope and yourself
your affectionate aunt at della hunter
i don't see it's beauty said benoy we've agree
it may have been pretty once but it is all fated now
tee me dorry does it argue a lack of proper respect for my ancestors that i can't feel very enthusiastic over this hair loom especially when grandmother hunter died ears before i was born
it was very kind of armed adela to send it said dory dutifully
why the wrong side is ever so much prettier than the right is claimed panopea
what lovely old dy stuff at not a beat fated
i declare it is as good as mew
well let us go and have tek said penelope i decidedly hungry
besides i see the poverty popular coming
it is something to passes an handling after all
panopea was surprised as much as the tender sisterly hurt could wish when doris flashed out upon her threw fane and the evening on the party with the black skirt nicely pressed and re hung and the prettiest waist imaginable a waist that was a positive creation of thy rose bess sprinkled silk with a girdle and notes of black velvet
so penelope went to blanche's party and her dress was the admiration of every god there
penelope thought her altogether charming
she looks us if she had just stepped out of the frame of some lovely old picture she said to herself
my aunt adela gave me give us there materia she stammered
i'm named after her missus fair weather suddenly put her arm about penelope and ruth the young girl to her her lovely old face a blow with delight and tenderness
there you are my grandees she said
when i saw your dress i felt sure you were related to her i should recognize that rose bud seal if i came across it in tibet
and elope was four years older than i was but we were devoted to each other
soon after these our mother died and our house called was broken up
my dear i am a very lonely old woman with nobody belonging to me
now she buttoned missus fair worth's soft old hand affectionately
doris and penelope found narrow beads and plans changed in the twin cling of an ey
where missus farewel had gone doris and penelope bey looked at each other
as she slipped into her blue pint afternoon dress her aunt called to her from below
aunt jane was standing at the fold of the stairs with a lamp in one hand and the year old baby clanging to the other
she was a big shapeless woman with a wrong good natured face cheerful and father as a sunflower was own to jane at all times and occasions
i want to run over and see how missus biggs big is this evening city and you must take care of the baby till i get back
sein they sighed and went downstairs for the baby
all her days were alike as far us hard work and dullness when but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly
but she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter
the room was more and their box about the kitchen which sid they charred with toots more cousins
her bed and the cot where the little girls slept filled up almost all the available space
just at that particular anger one eye appeared to be as large as an orange while the other was the size of appa and the months exacted from ear to ear

he wrote that although his age to bird him from membership in the club he was plenty and the limit was eighteen he read the letters of the department with much interest and often had thought of answering some of the request for crest on debts
she never had done so but ellen doubtless s's letter was so interesting that he had decided to write to her
would she be king enough to correspond with him
he was two years out from the east and had not yet forgotten to be homesick at times

i love life and its bloom and brilliancy a law of meeting new people i love the reole of music the harm of loving and conversation
the man had been talking it was all more the great novice
as it was i had contradicted him twice and he had laughed and liked it but his both will always have a new meaning to me henceforth through the inside he himself has given me
it is such meetings at these that give life it sparkle for me
you will be weary of my rocks thees over her
which she has sympathy and understanding for my every moon

no and you never will understand i can't my hue on the stand
everything i told you about it and my life was just imagination
then why did you write then he asked blankly
why do you deceive me
oh i didn't mean to deceive you i never thought of such a thing
i just couldn't ride you about my life here not because it was hard but it was so ugly and empty
and when once i had begun i had to keep it up

john lincoln opened the gate and wept up to her

alicia thought deeply for it she recognized all at once several things she had been mystified by before
octavia smiled the door again
lucia sat thinking her hands clasped tightly
i am glad i came here said at length
i think i shall never be afraid of her anymore
her delicate nostrils were dilated and she held her head up her breath came fast there was a hint of regulation in her tone
she walked very fast after she left the house
but it was not against him that lucius indignation was aroused
she wondered if he had heard her last words she faintly he had
it took hold of her shaking little hand and looked down on her excited face
i had angry she said you have never seen me angry before
i'm on my way to my lady theobald
he held her hair as calmly as before
what are you wing to say to her he asked she laughed again
held her hand rather closer
she has made you very angry he said
and then almost before she knew what she was doing she was pouring forth the whole of her story even more of it than she had told octavia
lucia he said i wish you would let me go and talk with lady theobald you should with little strip
yes he answered let me go to her
if you will say yester that i think i can promise that you m never be afraid of her any more

in fact she had perfectly confounded her ladyship by her demeanour
i beg you'll not speak to me that here and she said i will not listen to
and turning about she walked out of the rip

the peace of cambrai was called the ladys peace in honour of the two princesses who had rotated it though morally different and a very unequal worth they both had minds of a rare order and trained to recognize political necessities and not to attempt any but possible successes

it was carlo d la vega the prince of spanish poesy the spanish petrarch according to his fellow countrymen
bonny signed a similar one for pied ma
they all repaired together to the house prepared for their reception and after dinner the emperor of being tired lay down a rest on a couch queen eleanor before long went and tapped at his door and sent word to the king that the emperor was awake
frances with the cardinal de lorraine and the constable the memory soon arrived
on entering the chamber he found the emperor still lying down and chatting with his sister queen who was seated beside him on a chair
yes said charles i had made such cheer that i was obliged to sleep it off
frantic did the converse with his own collar
only seven of the attendants remained in the emperor's chamber and there the two savers conversed for an hour after which they moved to the hall where a splendid supper awaited them
the genes pleaded their privilege of not being liable to be taxed without their own consent
orders had been sent everywhere to receive him as kings of france are received on their joyous assess
the since there existed for us no responsibility we each reported dutifully at the roll call of habit and dropped back into our blankets with a grateful sigh
i remember the moon sail in a good gate among apparently stationary clouds i recall a deep black shadow lion before distant silvery mountains i glanced over the stark motionless canvases each of which concealed a man the air trembled with a bellman of cattle and the corrals
seemingly but a moment later the cook's howl brought me to consciousness again
three were to care for the reuda five were to move the straight herd from the corrals to good feed three bread and crews were told to brand the calf we had collected and the cut of the afternoon before that took up about half the men
the wrists were to make the shore drive and the salt grass
we were the only ones who did go afoot however although the crowds were not more than two hundred yards as distance
between the upright bars of greece wood we could see the cattle and here the opposite side the men build in a fire next the fence
we pushed open the wide gate and entered
one stood waiting for them to finish a sheaf of long j h stamp and irons in his hand
all the wrists squatted on their hills along the fence smoking cigarettes and chatting together
the first rays of the sun sighted across and one great sweep from the remote mountains
homer wooden an old californy john rodin among the cattle
as a loop settled he jerked sharply upward exactly as one would strike to hook a big fish
homer wrapped the rope twice or thrice about the horn and set over in one strip avoid the tiding line and to preserve the balance
nobody paid any attention to the calf
behind him followed his anxious mother her head swing in from side aside near the fire the horse stopped
the two bull dogs immediately pounced upon the victim
it was promptly forked over on its right side
thus the calf was unable to struggle
when once you have had the wind knocked out of you or a river two broken you cease to think u unnecessarily rough
hot iron yelled one of the bull agers
marker yelled the other
the brander pressed the iron smoothly against the flank
perhaps the cap bladed a little lest the heat scorched
the bran show cherry which is the proper color to indicate due plan and a successful mark
then he knit that a swallow tail in the other
it seems to me the great deal of unnecessary twaddle is abroad as to the extreme cruelty of brandon
undoubtedly it is to some extent painful it could some other method of ready identification be devised it might be as well to adopt it in preference

one of the little animals was but a few months old so the rider did not bother with its hind legs but tossed his loop over its neck
mister frost bull calf alone in pictorial history shows the attitudes
and then of course there was the gorgeous contrast between all this frantic and uncomprehended excitement and the absolute matter of fact and prep notability of horse and rider
as he knew his business and as the calf was a small one the little beast went over promptly bit the ground with the whack and was pounce upon and held
he would catch himself on one foot scrambled vigorously an in by struggling back to the upright
he could imagine what happened next
this is productive of some fond of it fails
but now the brandon was a full swing
when the nooses fell they turned and walked towards the fire as a matter of course rarely did the cast fail
men ran to and fro busy and intent
sometimes three or four calves were on the ground at once
thus aided dissipated
no more nick calves they announced
then he would spit on his hands and go at it alone
of luck attended his first effort his sarcasm was profound there's your little calf said he
would you like to have me toted to you or do you reckon you could toddle this far with your little old iron
toward non the work slep
finally homer rode over to the cattleman and reported the brandon finished
the latter counted the marks in his tally book
one hundred seventy sixth he announced
the markers squatted on their heels told over the bits of ears they had saved
but total amounted to but an hundred seventy five

it fair made my hair rise to hear him with a big still solemn desert outside and the quiet moonlight in the shadows and him setting up straight and gaunt his eyes blazing each side his big eagle nose and his snaky hair hanging over the raw cut across his head
however i made out to getting bandaged up and in shape and pretty soon he sort of on to sleep
an again he'd seemed that barbary some me to go out look at the old collar rad o flowing by just to be sure i an died and gone below or elsie jes talked
he began when he was a kid and he gave the sight of conversations pulsing for replies
i used to listen by the hour but i never made out anything really important as to who the man was or where he come from or what he done
i didn't pay any attention tom for he is quiet
usual i didn't bother with his talk for it didn't mean anything a something in his voice made me turn
he was lion on his side those black eyes of his blazoned me but now both of them saw the same distance
where are my clothes he asked very intense
one little squeeze tal bac your deadly weapons
but he been too sick and too long a bit
in a minute or so he came to

i know he pleaded but leet me see them
just as satisfying are passed over his old birds
i've been robbed he cried
where's my coat he asked

he looked at mean mighty suspicious but didn't say anything more he wouldn't even answer when i spoke to him
after he did in a fair male he fell asleep

i didn't seemed began for two days
then i caught sight him quite aways all

the gleam die from his eye the snarl lift his lips
in any casey flew poppo proto leaving me and my friend together
during the next two months he was a good deal bout town mostly doing odd jobs i saw him off and on

wai asked why not he retorted
we talk the matter over at length
i stood after a larger party
he strongly opposed this as depreciating the shares but i had no intention of going alone into what was then considered a wild and dangerous country finally we compromise
a third of the treasure was to go to him a third to me and the rest was to be divided among the man whom i should select this scheme did not appeal to him
junior avonlea found it hard to settle down to humdrum existence again

oh marilla but a tangled web we weave when first we practice tow to see

with a dismal sigh she went for the scissors
but there was nothing comforting and having your hair cut off because you've died it a dreadful color is there

it seemed such a tracer cling
anne wept then but laid her on when she went upstairs and wilt in the glass she was calm with to span

it is terrible about this afternoon now
of course you must be lan anne said diana
of course it would be romantic conceded jane andrews but i know that i couldn't keep still
but it's so ridiculous to have a red heady lan mourned anne
and a lane was a lily name
your complexion is just as fair as rubies said diana earnestly and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it
it was splendid to fish for trot over the bridge and the two girls lowed to row themselves about in the little flat bottom dory mister barry kept product shooting
it was an aided they dramatize a lane
those day she said were so much more romantic than the present
they had often gone down like this and the thing could be more convenient for playing a lay
the black shell having been procured anne spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast
it spoils the effect be guess this is hundreds of years before missus lynde borne

jane rested occasion
thus behind the landing
anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard she was white to the lips but she did not lose her self possession
there is one chance just one
under such circumstances you don't think went about making a flowery prayer
the fac drifted under the birds and then promptly sank in midstream
ruby jane and diana already a winning it on the lower headland saw it disappear before the very eyes and had no doubt but that anne had gone down with it
the minutes passed by is seeming like an hour to the unfortunate lily mad
why didn't somebody come where had the girls gone
her imagination began to suggest all manner of crux and possibilities to her
anne charley
how on earth dyed up there he exclaimed
it is certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances
what has happened then
asked gilbert taking up his oars
we were playing in lame explained anne frigidly without even looking at her rescuer and i had to drift down to camelot in the barge and in the pot
for a moment anne hesitated
her heart gave a quickly queer little bee
her resentment which to other an older people might be laughable as its cause was a no whit allayed and softened by time seemingly
no she said coldly i shall never be friend with you gilbert blythe and i don't want to be
all right
i'll never ask you to be friends again anne shirley and i don't care either
of course he had insulted her terribly but still
everything i do get to me or my dearest france into a scrape
anne's presentiment prove more trustworthy than presentiments are apt today

i don't say how said marilla
ever since i came to green gables i've been making mistakes and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming
our extremest pleasure has some sort of groaning and complaining in it would you not say that it is dying of pain
the highest and fullest contentment offers more the grave than of the marry ipso felicitas say missy temperat primate even felicity unless it moderate itself oppresses
socrates says that some god tried to mix in one mass and to confound pain and pleasure but not being able to do it he bethought him at least to couple them by the tale metre door said that in sorrow there's some mixture of pleasure
nature discovers this confusion to us painters hold that the same motions and grimaces of the face that serve for weeping serve for laughter two and indeed before the one of the other be finished do but observe the painter's manner of handling and you will be in doubt to which of the two the designed tends and the extreme of laughter does at last bring tears

the romans by this means erected their colonies for perceiving their city to grow immeasurably populous they eased it of the most unnecessary people and sent them to inhabit and cultivate the lands conquered by them sometimes also they purposely maintained wars with some of their enemies not only to keep their own men in action for fear lest idleness the mother of corruption should bring upon them some worse inconvenience
and we suffer the ills of a long piece luxury is more pernicious than war

i did said pen advancing towards the captain
i say answered pan with an oath i say we've had enough of it and we won't go any further
you shan't kill us with hunger and work in the winter and they shan't light the fires
for if you repeat what the man says answered hatteras i'll have you shut up in your cabin and guarded

he certainly will mister clawbonny
i'm of the same opinion as you johnson and if he only wanted one faithful companion he'll have two
prince albert land which the ford was then coasting bears also the name of grenelle land and though hatteras from his hatred to the yankees would never call it by its american name it is the one it generally goes by

when the lofty vicinity is about to maner upon his description of the plague that desolated athens one of his modern commentators assures the reader that the history is now going to be exceedingly solemn serious and pathetic and hints with that air of chuckling gratulation with which a good dame draws forth a choice morsel from a cupboard to regale a favourite that this plague will give his history a most agreeable variety
such are the true subjects for the historic pen
the fall of empires the desolation of happy countries splendid cities smoking in their ruins the proudest works of art tumbled in the dust the shrieks and groans of whole nations ascending unto heaven
thus those swarms of flies which are so often execrated as useless vermin are created for the sustenance of spiders and spiders on the other hand are evidently made to devour flies
ancient traditions speak much of his learning and of the gallant inroads he had made into the dead languages in which he had made captive a host of greek nouns and latin verbs and brought off rich booty and ancient saws and apothegm which he was wont to parade in his public harangues as a triumphant general of yore his sposi optimo
it was observed however that he seldom got into an argument without getting into a perplexity and then into a passion with his adversary for not being convinced gratis

thus when dogmas lead it what the man really and in general wills remains still the same
for these are careful only for themselves for their own egoism just like the bandit from whom they are only distinguished by the absurdity of their means
the deeds and conduct of an individual and of a nation may be very much modified through dogmas example and custom
with an equal degree of wickedness one man may die on the wheel and another in the bosom of this family
it is conceivable that perfect state or perhaps indeed a complete and firmly believed doctrine of rewards and punishments after death might prevent every crime politically much would be gained thereby morally nothing only the expression of the will in life would be restricted
we who here seek the theory of virtue and have therefore also to express abstractly the nature of the knowledge which lies at its foundation will yet be unable to convey that knowledge itself in this expression

therefore although the knowledge of the law of mankind generally does not make its disposition a joy form yet the permanent knowledge of his own nature in all living beings gives him a certain evenness and even surrender of disposition
for the interest which is extended to innumerable manifestations cannot cause such anxiety as that which is concentrated upon one
the accidents which concern individuals collectively equalize themselves while those which happen to the particular individual constitute good or bad fortune
thus though others have set up moral principles which they give out as prescriptions for virtue and laws which it was necessary to follow i as has already been said cannot do this because i have no aught or law prescribed to the eternally free will
which further than this it cannot go for there exists no reason for prefer in the individuality of mother to its own

so died socrates and der donno bruno and so many a hero of the truth suffered death at the stake at the hand of the priests
weeping is accordingly sympathy with our own selves or sympathy directed back on its source
it is therefore conditional upon the capac knee for love and sympathy and also fond imagination
when we are moved to tears not through our own suffering but through that of another this happens as follows
either we vividly put ourselves in the place of the sufferer by imagination or see in his fate the lot of humanity as a whole un consequently first of all our own lot and thus in a very roundabout way it is yet always about ourselves that we weep sympathy with ourselves which we feel this seems to be the principal reason of the universal and thus natural weeping in the case of death
for so all he certainly weeps for the fate of the dead but he also weeps when after long heavy and incurable suffering death was to this man a wish for deliverance

with him there came the mightiest of the heroes of greece
already he has heard of your bitter foes the tsar matai
he with his comrades would subdue them for you
y his heart was filled with wrath as he looked upon them and his eyes shone as a leopard's eyes
and then speaking to the key in a quiet voice jason said
his heart was divided as to whether he should summon his armed men and have them slain upon the spot or whether he should put them into danger by the trial he would make of them

a radiant figure it was and had met us knew that this was apollo come to him again
but apollo turned to admit a face that was without joy
what years of happiness have been mine or apollo through your friendship for me said admetus

and then he came upon an ancient woman who step upon stones in the courtyard drowned in corn between two stones
there she was sign as he had first known her with her eyes bleared and e knee shaky and with the dust of the courtyard and husks of the corn in her matted hair
he went to her and spoke to her and he asked her to take the place of the king and go with death
but when she heard the name of death horror came into the face of the ancient woman and she cried out that she would not let death come near her
admetus took the man shrivelled hand and he asked him if he would not take the king's place and goeth death that was coming for him
then admetus went into the palace and into the chamber bed was and he lay down upon the bed and he lamented that he would have to go with death that was coming for him from the god of wander world and he lamented that none of the wretched ones round the pace would take his place
one should go in your place for you are the key and have many great affairs to attend you
now the footsteps seemed to stop
it was not so terrible for him as before
and the words he had spoken he would have taken back the words that had brought her consent to go with death in his place
death would soon be here for her
no not here for he would not have death come into the palace
he lifted archest his throng bed and he carried her from the palace
no more speech came from her
and as for admetus he went within the chamber and knelt beside the bed on which au casta sad lane and thought of his terrible loss
to what god does th sacrifice do
and then ryles felt that another labor was before him
i have dragged up from the hand world he fought the hounds at guards those whom death bring sound into the realm of the god of thunder old
why should i not strive with death
and what a noble theme it would be to bring back this faithful woman to her house and to her husband
he left the palace of admetus and he went to the temple of the gods
you are held by me death and you will not be let go unless you promise to go forth from this temple without bringing one with you
and death knowing that heracles could hold him there and that the business of the god of underwood would be left undone if he were held promised that he would leave the temple without bringing one with him
she was veiled and admitted could not see her features
here is a woman whom i am bring back to her husband i want her from an enemy
this i cannot do cent her medicus have had pains enough
then at medicus raised the veil of the woman he had taken across the thresh shoulder his house
he now went h till he came to the house at a door at which he was to knock vis heated two or three times
christie i have thump to sated good man at the house
christian sir i am come from the city of destruction and am on my way to montes

they told christian that he had no need for care on despoil for long youths had made a law and they could prove that it had been silvery ears
yes said they no doubt of it
and if we getting the goat at all pray what are yacht

i saw then that they all went on do they came to the foot of the heel of difficulty where they was a spring
now when christian got as far as the spring of fight he tread of it and then went of few
now hap we up was occasion made by lord of that hue that those who came by at breath there

the name of the men who kept the lodge of that house was watchful and when he saw that christian made heal as if he would go that he came out to him and said is by strength so small
fear nought to beaten wild beasts f they are abound by chains and are put here to try the fate of those that habit and to find out those that hath known

they had not much to say as they knew that they were in force
and by this act p cured ourselves as well
or for whether indicate man would have been master of a man
therefore in the state of innocence th had no mastership of the animals
therefore in the state innocence before man had its spade nothing d spaded that was naturally subject to him
signally disapproved by the oder of divine providence which h was governs in theory things by the superior
certainly this is proved from a property of man and bather animals
and now whatever part is pated is subject to what is essential and universal
or therefore the subjection of other animals to man is prop to be natural
they would now however on this kind have been accepted from the mastership of men as neither at present nor they for their reason accepted from the mastership of god his providence has mordan all this
this is signified by the fact that god led it the animo to men that he might give them names expressive of their respect of natures
so all animals would have a bit men of their own court as in the presents day some domestic animals obeyed him
objection one it was seen that in the safes man would not have had mastership over all other creatures
much less therefore would he have a bit man in state of innocence
therefore since it is by this reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems filling the state land since man ha not been in over plans
now a men reason has the position of the master and not of a subject
i answer that we must needs omit that in a primitive state there would have been some any quality at least as regards sex because generation depends upon diversity sex and likewise as regards age for some would have been born of others nor would sere union have been sterile
there might also have been bodily disparity
the quality miles arise on the parts of nature as both described without any defect of nature
objection one he will sing that in the stiffens men would not have been mess over men
therefore in a state of innocence may not have been subject to man
in other sense mastership is referred in a general since to any kind of subject and in this sense even pay has the office of governing and directing freemen can be caught a master
such a kind of mastership would have existed in the stances between man and men for two reasons
but in the state innocence they would have been lowed miscible age
on the contrary everything generated discoursing perfect but in the sate venisons children would have been begotten by generation
therefore from the first they would happen in perfect e boding the size and power
therefore in the state of innocence there was no need for women to be borne on the contrary nature's processing generation would happen in harmony with manner in which it was established by god
i have been told that mister van brandt is in prison for debt i said
and i saw for myself last night that he had left you helpless
he left me the little money he had with him when he was arrested she rejoined sadly
tse cruel creditors are more to bled than he is for the poverty that has fallen on us
even this negative defence of van brandt stung me to the quick i ought to have spoken more guardedly of him i said bitterly
i ought to have remembered that a woman can forgive almost any wrong that a man can inflict on her when he is a man whom she loves
she put her hand on my mouth and stopped me before i could say any more
how doan you speak so cruelly to me she asked
you know to my shame i confessed it to you the last time we met you know that my heart and secret is all yours
what wrong are you talking of
is it the wrong i suffered when van brandt married meat with a wife living at the time and living still
do you think i can never forget the great misfortune of my life the misfortune that has made me unworthy of you
it is no fault of mine god knows but it is not the less true that i am not married and that the little darling who is playing out there with her doll as my child
and you talk of my being your wife knowing that the child accepts me as her second father i said
it would be better and happier for us both if you had as little pride as a child pride she repeated
in such a position as mine
a helpless woman with a mock husband in prison for debt
am i to marry you for my food and shelter
am i to marry you because there is no lawful tie that binds me to the father of my child
that is he is he has now forsaken me he has been forced away
my only friend is it possible that you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife
the woman in my situation must be heartless indeed who could destroy your place in the estimation of the world in the regard of your friends
though wretchedest creature that walks the streets which shrink from treating you in that way
now what are men made of
how can you how can you speak of it
i yielded and spoke of it no more
every word she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom i had loved and lost
bitterly as i hated the man who had parted us i loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake hopeless infatuation
i don't deny it i don't excuse it hopeless infatuation you have forgiven me i said
let me deserve to be forgiven
it is something to be your only friend
you must have plans for the future tell me unreservedly how i can help you
complete the good work that you have the gun she answered gratefully helped me back the health
make me strong enough to submit to a doctor's estimate of my chances of living for some years yet
a doctor's estimate of your chances of living i repeated what do you mean
i hardly know how to tell you she said without speaking again of mister van brandt
that's speaking of him again named speaking of his debts i asked
why need you hesitate
you know that there is nothing i will not do to relieve your anxieties
never let me tell you the plain truth
which there is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison
yes this is his position in two words a little while since he obtained an excellent offer of employment abroad from a rich relative of his and he had made all his arrangements to accept it
unhappily he returned to tell me of his good fortune and the same day he was arrested for debt
this mirrors that had been said for her was plainly revealed in those four words
in the eye of the loss she was of course a single woman she was of age she was to all intents and purposes her own mistress
what was there to prevent her from insuring her life if she pleased and from so disposing of the insurance as to give vampa a direct interest in her death
thanks to the happy accident of my position the one certain way of protecting her lay easily within my reach
i could offer to lend the scoundrel the money that he wanted in an hour's notice and he was a man to accept my proposal quite as easily as i could make it
you are quite mistaken i replied
i am only doubting whether your plan for relieving mister van brandt of his embarrassments is quite simple as you suppose
are you aware as the delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to borrow money and your policy of insurance
i know nothing about it she said sadly
will you let me ask advice of my lawyers
they are trustworthy unexperienced men and i am sure they can be abused to you
cautiously as i had expressed myself her delicacy took the alarm
promise that you won't ask me to borrow money of you for mister van branch she rejoined and i will accept to help gratefully
i could honestly promise that
my won chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge to corset i had now determined to pursue
i rose to go while my resolution still sustained me
kiss me she whispered before you go
it is only your goodness that overpowers me
the next day everybody in the house began to make preparations with a journey
everything was done very leisurely though there was a lot of talking a disputing and the giving of contrary orders
the old porter was there directing as scolding the servants as they piled the rugs and blankets and bags of food and pots and pans and dishes into the wagon
there was quite a procession when that last the big wagon rumbled out through the gateway
behind i came the pan mother and her duly deck a lita litter or easy chair some between two long poles
besides the family there were many servants and several others walked beside a slow moving wagon
the cook too well with them
good bye shouted little no from miss garden was they went by good bye
they shouted greeting to their friend the potter as they passed them and also to the old factor smeared all over with ashes who sat in a little brick hut by the bridge and pretended to make wonderful cures
this is more fun their going to school c colour as the oxen plodded along their class of dust
these lovely birds are found nearly everywhere in india and in some parts are in quite wild
his long matted hair hung on his shoulders and he was saying his prayers with the help of a rosary of beads which he continually passed through his hands
as the wagon came up a young man who accompanied the holy man ran up and held out a begging bull saying give o charitable people to this holy one
no country in the world has so many beggars as india
many of them are caught holy men because they do nothing but make pilgrimages from one sacred place to another living solely on their ams that are given to them
when they had eaten their lunch their young people went to explore the garden near them
perhaps there are dogs said mahl a little fearfully but they forgot about dogs and they saw a thicket of sugar can down by a stream
perhaps you can buy some from the man there he is now pulling by the stream said calla
it is the giver water said the farmer as he took a law stock of cane and gently guided it down to the stream
the snake is another sacred animal of the hindoos and they will not kill or injure one for anything
as they were but to move on again they saw gree cloud of dust down the load
i turned out that it was a great and powerful regula goings they on admit with the another regard or ruler of one of the small kingdoms or states of which modern indios formerly made up
first there came a big elegant all decorated with silk and golden silver
on the elephant's back which was the howdy which was like a big chair of the canopy over it and in this sitting cross light was the roger her big fat fellow dressed in coloured silks and jewels the great diamond set plume in his turban
behind the how des that a servant holding a big umbrella a fond feathers over the rods head
the driver sat on the neck of the elephant and guided the big beast up their crowding him on one side or the other with an out shod stick or gold
isn't it fine to rile a down a big athens
and all the rest of the day the little folks talked of nothing but the great virgin escort
our party came to a halt am many other block carts the owners of which were already sitting around on the ground cooking the suppers or bargaining for food at a little booth
these they used for plates heaping them up with their boiled race and curry and sish and our stores of puddings and sweets
a supper was being eaten another party stopped at the paris and camped of far away
when the litter was put down the young boy stepped out looking very proudly and haughty
his servants at once spread a handsome rug in the ground for him to sit all and rushed about waiting on him taking good care to keep everyone under distant
yes and how he orders every one a bell him
around the little brahman's neck was a thin quarter thread which was the sign of his high cast
meanwhile the haughty little gammon ate his supper when this head turned away so no one could see him eat and then growing tired of respectful glasses of the crowd around him he got enter his litter again and the servants fastened the curtains tightly around him
everybody said soundly in spite of the fact that one of the servants was beating a drum mess of the night which they really believed was a way to keep off evil spirits
oh the these he cried
they're as bad as the baker's
were article guarding so carefully shea asked her brother
he and col were walking beset the wagon for a change
the lattices rise sosia and mother and aunt could enjoy the fresh air
there my dolls said the little girl sadly as she patted the wonderly cider
i take them with an offering to the holy river poor little woman
must th sacrifice thy toories too
smarter uncle as he patted her head
chapter forty nine griggs is stubborn
the days glided by with the stiffness and crisp these limbs growing less painful and the pony recovering fast for the clear mountaineer seemed to act like a cure for wounds
every day the came showed the injured animal and better condition
as efforts to move the longer made chrystal wins and forget his own pains in those who felt at singing the must suffer
everyone was busy for the keeping watch regularly took up a good deal of time

i'm afraid father will say that the ponies ought to be close at hand

there're always too many red skins about cried christ impatiently
i wish we could charge them boldly ascend them flying over the plains
never to come back again said ned sharply
not quite my lads though you see that were playing a very ticklish game
just then the doctor came to the shelter with a boys having talking bringing with them walton lovely shooting or rather trying to shoot for he had had no success and they too were talking earnestly about ways and these
oh here your briggs cried the doctor
had a good turnus scouting yes sir
the indians have shifted quarters and therein about us elk a position as we could contrive for our purpose
we must get away from here to some good hunting ground
to the indian sing to be camping or only on the moods
this seemed to me to be hatching up some dodger another replied books
then he began to walk up and gal slowly i wouldn't like deep in thought
there he said as made of my mind
it is very evident that we may wait here to our stores actuly and be as far off the opportunity we seek us ever
the indians can wait we cannot and they seem to know it
going to give up young chris's plan said per exposing
no i'm going to put it in force at once we start to night

ejaculated craggs so sharply that the boys started ser right if they did sir
what business have they to want our sculp what we should have shut them up to five
they'd have weeks of work these li they could get their horses out but without horses they'd be out and awake
starve nonsense
but there i don't want to make speeches it's our settled gentlemen
well you've got eh other lookout with coming off
now everyone understand that he is to be ready without showing any watch foot in din scout that there is something on the way
and again when the artist's following malicorne advice was a little late in arriving and when saint agnan had been obliged to be absent for some time it was interesting to observe though no one witnessed them those moments of silence full of deep expression which united in one side two souls most disposed to understand each other and who by no means objected to the quite meditation enjoyed together
in a word malicorne philosopher that he was though he knew it not had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in the midst of play and with desire in the assurance of possession
in this manner therefore without leaving her room and having no confidant she was able to return to her apartment thus removing by her appearance a little tardy perhaps the suspicions of the most determined sceptic
but the door remain close and neither sight agen nor the painter appeared nor did the hangs even you
go then dearest love said the king return quickly
no no not today siren
i knew but too well that you had not ceased to love me
the valerie with a gesture partly of extreme terror and partly as if invoking a blessing attempted to speak but could not articulate one word
at the moment however when the king threw himself on his knees a cry of utter despair rang through the corridor accompanied by the sound of retreating footsteps
the captain sitting buried in his leather armchair his spurs fixed and the floor his sword between his legs was reading a number of letters as he twisted his moustache
d'artagnan uttered a welcome full of pleasure when he perceived his friend's son
well all my boy he said by what a lucky incident does it happen that the king has i called june
these words do not sound agreeably in the young man's ears who as he seated himself reply upon my word i cannot tell you all that i know is i have come back hum
that the king has not recalled you and you have returned
i did not understand that at all
raoul was already pale enough and he now began to turn his hat round and round in his hand
what they dose is the matters that you look as you do and what makes you so dumb
said the captain do people nowadays a soon that sort of airs in england
i have been in england and came here again as lively as a chaffinch
will you not say something
i had too much to say
ah how is your father
forgive me my dear friend i was going to excuse that
d'artagnan increased his sharpness of his penetrating gaze which no secret was capable of resisting
you are happy about something he said
i am indeed and you know the reason very well monsieur d'artagnan
nay did not pretend to be astonished
i am not pretending to be astonished my friend
i have neither head nor arm do not despise but help me in two words i am the most wretched of living beings oom
she is deceiving ill said d'artagnan got a muscle of whose face hadad moved those are big words who makes use of them
everyone ah
if everyone says so there must be some truth in it
not for a friend for a son
what i do take it you are really ill from curiosity
no it is not from curiosity is from love
cut another big word
i tell you i love louise to distraction
well suppose it were only that
no sensible man ever succeeded in making much of a brain when the head was turned
i have completely lost my senses in the same way a hundred times in my life
you would hear but you would not understand me you would understand but you would not obey me
oh try tie
i go far even if i were unfortunate enough to know something and foolishly enough to communicate it to you you are my friend you say indeed yes
very good i should quarrel with you
i never complain as you know but as heaven and my father would never forgive me for blowing out my brain i will go and get the first person i meet to give me the information which you withhold i will tell him he lies in and you a killum
and a fine affair that would be so much the better what should i care
you now assume a different ton instead of killing you will get killed yourself i suppose you mean very fine indeed
how much i should regret you
of course i shall go about all day saying ah
what a fine stupid fellow that bragelonne was
as great as stupid as i ever met with
go then rowl go and get yourself disposed of if you like
i hardly knew who can have taught you logic but dost take me if your father has not been regularly robbed of his money
grell will buried it fac in his hands murmuring no i have not a single friend in me world
i dull fancies monsieur i do not laugh at you though i am a gascon
aft there what do you mean
upon my word i did not know someone told me there was a carpenter who made an opening through a certain floor
why don't know where
and whose room them
i have told you for the last hour that i know nothing of the whole affair
but the painter in the portrait
while you see to him only that name in your mouth
i did not suppose it will concern him
yes you're right and he made a step or two as if he were going to lead why are you going
to look for some one who will tend me the truth
who is that a woman
you wish to be consoled by someone and you will be so at once she will tell you nothing in of herself of course so be off
you are mistaken monsieur replied raoul though omen i mean will tell me all the evils she possibly can
well i admit it
and in point of fact why should i play with you as a cat does with the poor mouth
you distress me you do indeed
wait if you can
i could not so much th worse
ah said raoul snatching eagerly at the pen which the captain held out to him
how very fortunate that is he was looking for you too
she said in the same tone of voice it is not i who am going to speak to him oh then
