as i approached the city i heard bells ringing and a little later i found the streets astir with throngs of well dressed people in family groups winding their way hither and thither
looking about me i saw a gentleman in a neat black dress smiling and his hand extended to me with great cordiality
he must have realized i was a stranger and wished he tendered his hospitality to me i accepted it gratefully i clasped his hand he pressed mt him
we gazed for a moment lightly into each other's eyes
of course you are going there too i said to my friendly guide
yes he answered i cannot the worship i am a priest
an idle i whispered taken by surprise
they worshiped god they did not exist
that the greeks love their gods i protested my heart clamly my breast
no i said in a low voice
he was an idle then and not a god
it made athens to see of light he created the beautiful the true the good yes our religion was divine
it had only one fought in troop of my guide what was that
i inquired without knowing what his aunts would be it was not true
produce him
i wis me to myself what blasphemy
then taking heart i told my guide how more than once i had felt apollo's radiant presence in my heart and told him of the immortal lines of homer concerned the d van hollo
do you doubt homer
i said to him homer the inspired barred
no no apollo is not an idle
he is a god and a son of a god
the air was heavy with incense a number of men and gorgeous vestments were passing to and fro thou in a kneeling before the various lights and images
observing my anxiety to understand the mean of all this my guy took me aside and in a whisper told me that the people were silbury in the anniversary of the birthday of their beautiful savior jesus the son of god
forget apollo he said with his digestion of severity his voice
there is no such person he was only an idle
if he would a search for apollo and all the e verse he would never find e one answering to his name were description
i want to see jesus i hasten turning toward him
will he not be here this morning
when he not speak to his worshippers i asked again
will he not permit them to touch him to caress his hand to class his divined feet to u held the ambrosial fragrance of his breath to bask in the golden light of his eyes to hear the musick of his immaculate accents
i asked my eyes feel with wonder in my voice quivering with excitement
would not that then i vent to ask impatiently make ease as much of an idle is apollo
and it faith that jesus is a god proves him a god why will not faith in apollo make him a god
but i am determine not only to know if it is possible the whole truth about jesus but also to communicate that truth through others
but there is more of a moral tonic and the open and candy discussion of a subjects like the one in hand than in the multitude of platitudes
i never del or lecture in which i do not even directly or indirectly if full in free expression int to my faith in everything that is worthy of faith
if i d do not believe in dogma is is because i believe in freedom
oh he tears down but he is not build up is another chrism about my work it is not true
no preacher a precis more constructive
class in truth in a jail bagging the mouth of the student is that building up or tearing down
when brine why the new torch to increase the lie of the world who was his forwards the stake
count your rights political religious social intellectual and telling which of them was conquered for you by the priest
i wish to tell you something
the first less be impersonal be a pett's irreverent blasphemer atheist and infidel are flung at a man not from pity but from envy
not having the courage or the industry of our neighbour who works like a busy bee in the world of men and books searching with the sweat of his brow for the real bread of life when in the open page afore him with his tears pushing into the we hours of the night his quest and made by the fairest of all loves the love of truth we ease our own indolent conscience by calling him names
a myth is of fanciful explanation of a given phenomenon
the mine craves for knowledge the child asked questions because of inborn desire to know
now and then they came close enough to snap at each other
with this mid thus the prom to man was satisfied untill h developed in intelligence realized its inadequacy science was born of that realization

we feel the space about and over us or spirits fairies gods and other invisible one airy beans

science was not born until man and matured

the cradle is the womb of all the fairies and face a mankind
the school was the birth place of science
glad was the science of the child
in the discussion of his subjects i appeal to the mature not to the childs mind
he is god's mouthpiece and no one may disagree with him
be only way i may command your respects is reasonable
let us place ourselves entirely in the hands of the evidence
as intelligent beans would desire to know whether this jesus whose worship was not only costing the world millions of the people's money but which is also drawing to his service the time the energies the affections the devotions and the laborer humanity is a myth or reality
a number of other dates were observed with a christian church of various times as the birthday of jesus the goss was give no date and appear to be quite uncertain really ignorant about it
yet there is no evidence that he was born on that day
why this discrepancy an historical document to say nothing about inspiration
again matt he says that to escape the evil designs of herd mary and joseph with the infant jesus fled into egypt loops has nothing about this hurd flight nor of herod's intention to kill the infant messiah
when we come the more important chapters of about jesus we meet with quitter difficulties
what is always on a friday that the cruz fixes commemorated the weak in which the day occur is very yer to year

the pack in austria has become a christian easter
but in the absence of evidence ord in offers of following mins c arguments against his papal clus one
if we are to have any mythology at all he seems to argue why object to adding to at the ms of jesus
the immediate companions of jesus appeared to be on mother hand as mythical as he is himself
who was matthew who was mark
who were john peter judas and mary
there is actuly no evidence that they ever existed
if peter ever went to rome with the new doctrine hows it that no historian has taken note of him
here again we see the presence of a myth
he was the only one who saw them
peter paul johns james judas o keep the stage almost as exclusively
it is impossible to explain why the contemporaries of jesus the authors in the historians of the his time you not take notice of him
could they have been that conspiracy against him
hows is his unanimous sides be accounted for
how then are we to decide which of the numerous candidates for divine honor should be given our votes
and such a faith is never free it is always maintained but a sword now and by hell fi hereafter
yet the most impossible utterances are put in use mouth
only a mythical jesus could virtually hand over the govern of evils de quarters who have petitions to press upon his attention
moreover give uses could keep his promise there would be to day no misery in the world no orphans no childless mothers no shipwrecks no floods no famines no disease no crippled children no in sanity no wars no crime no wrong
have these prayers been answered
how he self deluded profits these extravagant claims have produced
and who can number the bitter disappointments caused by such impossible promises
the same which a preachers of to day give he parried his aunts with many words and at length said that the promise was betaken with the provision that what we ask for would be given if god fy it for our good
but he said if he ask anything in my name i will do it and if it were not so i would have told you
d he not mean just where he said
self effort and not prayer is a remy against ignorance slavery poverty and lore degradation
it was a knight when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity when with impressible persons love becomes solicitous ness hope sinks to misgiving and faith to hope when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret and opportunities for ambition that had been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise
still to a close observer they are just as perceptible the difference is that their medea of manifestation are less trite and familiar than such well known ones as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf

her mother came into the room before this roil of pulse was adjusted into anything like order
mister hale sipped his tea abstracted silence margaret had the responses to herself
she forgot that he had not made them an offer
margaret was repairing her mother's worsted work and rile the shrinking from the thought of the long evening and wishing bedtime were come that she might go over the events of the day again
margaret
warner speak to about something very seen mister to a soul
very seer to a saul
mister lennox had never had the opportunity of having any point's conversation with a father after her refusal or else that would indeed be a very serious affair
but she soon felt it was not about anything which having only lately and suddenly occurred could have given rise to any complicated thoughts at her father wished to speak to her
mister hale did not answer for a m dart
margaret could not bar the sight of this suspense which was even more distressing to her fathers than to herself
but why dear papa don't tell me
because i must no longer be minister in the church of england
but nothing to the shocks rey received from mister hale's last speech what could he mean
it was all the worst for being so mysterious
why can you no longer the o ex clergyman

margaret i will tell you about it

as he read this and glanced much more which he did not read he gain resolution for himself and felt as if he too could be brave and firm in doing what he believed to be right but as he ceased he heard margaret's low convulsive sob and his courage sang down under the keen sense of suffering
i have born long with self reproach that would have roused any mind less tall bidd and cowardly than mine
he shook his head as he went on
margaret i cried to do it i tried to content myself with simply refusing their disan prethident and stopping quietly here stranding my conscience now as i had strained it before
god forgive me
he rose and walked up and down the room speaking no words of self reproach and humiliations of which margaret was thankful to hear but the few
margaret i returned to the old said burden we must leave helstone

now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of herself and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had taken on himself
i don't know
sonya smiles no
it's because she was in log without fat one his spectacles that was her picture described his namesake the new cow bezukhov and now she's in love without singer he met natasha's italian singing master that's why she's ashamed

the countess had been prepared by anemic kova's heads at dinner
on retiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes strict on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuff box while the tears kept coming into her eyes
the coats putt his ear to the keyhole and lizard
at first he heard the sound of indifferent voices then anemic loan's voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silence then both voices together with glad intonations and then fruit steps
an ami kova opened the door
when she heard this sonya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and unable to be in the lugs turned upon her ran away into the dancing hall we o' round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon and flushed and smiling plumped down on the floor
the cess was cry
from all he says is one should be gladly not cry
how charmingly he describe said she reading the descriptive part of the letter and what a soul

the pavlograd held feast after feast celebrating a wards they had received for the campaign and made expeditions to all moods to visit as certain carline the hungarian who had recently opened arrest on deer with girls as waitresses
the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading their claim less and discipline
the regiments had entered and left the town with their bands playing and by the grand jig's orders the men had marched all the way in step a practice on which the guards prided themselves the officers on fuit and at their proper pose
bors had had been quar h and had marched all the way with berg who was already in commin of a company
bors during the campaign had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become acquaint with prince andrew bolkonski though whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in chief stuff
berg and boris having rested after yesterday's march were sitting clean and neatly dressed at a round table in the clean quarters a lotty to them plain chess
well how are you going to get out of that's he remarked
at that woman door opened
dear me how you have changed
he was about to embrace his friends but nicholas avoided him
he wanted to pinch him push him do anything but kiss him a thing everybody did
but notwithstanding there spars embraced him and a quiet friendly we and kissed him three times
they had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when young ment their first steps and likes road each saw immense changes in the other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps
i did not expect you to the he added
you know of course at his imperial highness rod with our regiment all the time so that we in every comfort in every advantage
what receptions we had in polands
what dinners and balls i can't tell you
o you guards said rostov i say s as a wine
he went to his bed drew apart them undo the clean pillow and sent for wine
yes and i have some money in a letters to give you he added
i'll don't mention at cones i quite understand said berg getting up and speaking in a muffled in druther voice
go of cross you arks they invited you id boris
berg put on the finest of coats without a spot or speck of dust stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and having insured himself from the way rostov looked at it that his court had been noticed left the room with a pleasant smile
oh dear was a beast i are muttered rostov as he rent a letter why
well have you san gabriel for some white all right les how sub
in the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to bagration which the old countess had anemic colvin's advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to take it to its destines and make use of it
why have you thrown that away asked boris
it is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i wanted for
he looked intently and inquiringly into his friend's eyes evidently trying in v to find the answer to some questions
which he believe at kind i was not at all alarmed as i knew i was right
i came forwards werk stood up and showed how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respects and self complacency then his did
well he stunned it me as the saying is stunned and stunned and stormed
there was not a matter of life but rather of death as the saying is
albans and devils and too siberia said berg with a sagacious smile
still i remained silent and what do you think cit
the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day
that's the wake h said berg lighting his pipe and emitting lings are smoke
yes that was fin rostov smiley
rostov with a truce mall young man and wid u no a carn have told a deliberate lie
he began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened the imperceptibly involuntarily and inevitably he lapsed into fal suit
prince andrew who liked to help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed towards boris who had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what young man wanted
in spite of prince andrews disagreeable' ironical tone in spite of the contemn with which rostov from his fighting army point of view regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently won rostov fell confused blushed and became silent
lars inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without indiscretion one might ask about our plans
we shall probably advance replied bol kuski evidently reluctant to see more in the presence of a stranger
berg at the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was rumor the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled
i was stare said rostov angrily as if intending to insult the eight de camp
with a slightly contemptuous smile he said yes that are many stories now told them at that a fear
but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy's fire
o our stories have some wights not like the stories as those fellows on the staff who get my wars without doing anything
however he added rising you know my name and we're to find me they don't forget that i do not regards either myself or you as having been at all insulted and as a man aller than you my advices to let the matter drop
exclaimed prince andrew and was about to them both he went out
and he was still more angrier having omitting to see us
he ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of bors rod home
should he go to headquarters nees ee and challenge that ef fated adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that wide him all the we

no sooner with some semblance of order restored in some exceptionally heavy way would tear away the lashing and the work had to be done all over again
from this moment about f m the injure room became the centre of interest
the water gained his spite of everye effort

the danger was certain now it was near

one was rolling the other had a gun in his hand what should she do
her tired lakes could not propel the tired body rapidly
the gol saw the boat nearing her
in a moment more the boat was on her and the men at the oars had leaned over and caught her
i was tormented by thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctor's orders
that old man sees to give so much annoyance yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams
pill ca given them orders not to speak to me of this
this made had stolen from me certain little things of some importance and in her fear of being detected she would have been very glad if i had died
accordingly she allowed me twice to take as much as i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask full i then covered myself and began to sweat and fell into a deep sleep
they see that my poor friend was on the point of falling to the ground so grieved was he to hear this
afterwards he took in agly state and began to beat the serving girl with all his mind shouting out ahhh traitress you have killed him for me then
she may did have saved my life so let me a helping hand for i have sweated and be quick about it
flure recovered his spirits dried and make me comfortable and i been conscious of a great improvement in my state began to reckon on recovery

that sim booted mice roer nino made uns san if he had drunk another bottle he would have been cured upon the spot
afterwards he turned to me and asked if i could have drunk more water
i answered no because i had entirely pointed my thirst
in like manner she was asking for what she wanted when the poor young man that du to bleed him
if you knew that recovery depended upon his drinking two flasks of water why did you not say so before
you might then have boasted of his kill
at this words the wretched quiet sulkily departed and never showed his face again
the very evening i was taken with great precautions in a chair well wrapped up and protected from the cold
do not permitting any irregularities for though he has escaped this time another disorder now would be the death of him
that he turned to me and sat my van veneto be prudent commit no excesses and when you are quite recovered i bagged you to make me a madonna with your own hand and i will always pay my devotions to it for youll sake
so i made my mind up and prepared to travel
that day many friends came to see me among others pierre lady who was the best and dearest friend i ever had
next day there came a certain nicolo da monte ago who was also a very great friend of mine
i had harboured him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house upside down for the man was subjects to a species of dry scab which he was always in the habit of scratching with his hands
meanwhile that able physician francs co d monte vary attended to mature with great skill
there they sit at me to wait until the duke went by
many of my friends at court came up to greet me an expressed surprised that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shattered by illness they s that i oughter have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke
at this words misor agostino the duke's taylor made his way through all those gentlemen and said it thats all you want to know you shall knowed at this veryain moment
george's a painter whom i have mentioned happen just then to pass and myra agostino exclaimed there is the man will accuse you now you know yourself if it be true or not
as fiercely as i could not being able to leave my seat i asked george if it was true that he had accused me
he denied that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sword
my strow augustino retorted you gallows bird
don't you know that i know it for most certain
georgia made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me
then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted
the duke dazed at me and marveled i was deal alive afterwards he vade he take heed to be an honestest man and regain my health
when i reached home nicolo da mona grout came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin written with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards take french leafed because my jean came from a quarter and a man who was able to destroy me
i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had endured me and told him all the affair about the mint
he repeated get hens quickly as you can and be of good courage for you will see a vengeance executed sooner than you expects
i the best attentions to my health gave pier thorow bag ox advice about stamping the coins and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else
you want them to immortalized that ferocious tyrant
you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you i will inveterate fo and there devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mind to hang you without any faults of yours
it was firmly believed that duke alessandro was the son of pope clan
mer francesco used also to say and swear by all he saint that if he could he would have robbed me of the dies for that meadow
i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more
i thou sent to florence to request lorn sinon that he would send me the reverse of the meadow
nicolo da monte grotto to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosophers laud se n for it he had replied he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better event one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bring it without hesitations to the duke for this would be to my advantage
i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate impressed the world forward to my bestest ability
this being so as he was a fellow of much humour we used offered to laugh together about the great credit he had gain
i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling peas ready and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball
i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to hat my mark at two hundreds cubits which cannot be done by otherways of b loading
i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we made haste for rome
we have succeeded in amassing two hundreds ounces of silver enough i trust to erect a handsome bronze figure
to be sure it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priests boasting about i could live at ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose
but the priest far from guessing the drifts of his comrades thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of koona
here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in faery boats that start as soon as some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked
when the boatman and passengers heard the splashing saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made everye effort to save him but the wind was fair and the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundreds yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him
when he saw this the room feigned the utmost grief in dismay and said to his fellow passengers this priest whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron and as i happened to have business there as well we settled to travel together
now alas by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone
he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believed a story and pitied and tried to comfort him
then the ran and said to the boatman
what thank you gentlemen added he turning to the other travellers
they of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their onward journey and all with one voice agreed to what the ran and had proposed and so the matter was settled
when at length they reached the shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the ronin overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priests luggage and putting it with his own pursued his journey to kiyoto
fortune favouring his speculations he began to amass great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself nothing and in the course of time he married a wife who bore him a child
since then al wass gone well with me yet had i not been poor i had never turned to sassin north thief
he would have fled into the house but the ghost stretched forth its withered arm and clutching the back of his neck scow at him with a vindictive glare and a hideous ghastliness of mean so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear
at length undone by such ceaseless vexation took a bay fell ill and kept muttering o misery misery the wandering priest is coming to torture me
now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest who lodged in the next street
and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all over
three years ago at the cana fairy you flung me into the water and well you remember it
happily continued the priest i had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so i reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded in setting up a bronze figure to buddha thus fulfilling the wish of my heart
on my journey homewards i took a lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvelous ailment
thinking i could divine its cause i came to see you and am glad to find i was not mistaken
and would it not ill become me to bear malice
repent therefore and abandon your evil ways
to see you do so i should esteem the height of happiness
be of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that i am really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you
and a fit of madness i was tempted to kill and bobo
fortune befriended me ever after but the richer i crew the more keenly i felt how wicked i had been and the more i foresaw that my victim's vengeance with some day overtake me
haunted by this thought i lost my nerve till one night i beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill
but how you managed to escape in her still alive is more than i can understand
a guilty man said the priest with a smile shudders at the rustling of the wind or the chattering of a stork speak a murder's conscience praise upon his mind till he sees what is not

no well managed family would think of building a new house without finding in what direction to pace the front door
after this manner has been settled and the houses fairly begun there are a casal crises in its construction upon which much depends
of these the most importance the day when the ruth was raised
the house are then besides whether the days sat by the builder is a liking one for himself and his family
a present of money teach workman is also in order and will conduce to the rapid and faithful execution of the jobbed ha when at last the house is finished in carpenters and plasters or ready to leave it the local fireman who have assisted all along in the building as unskilled laborers often ascend to the ruth and from the ridge pole cast down cakes for which the children in the neighborhood scrambled joyfully
all come who can and those who cannot come send servants or provisions
on the day after the death often in the evening the body must we placed in the cask shaped cough un net until recently was a style commonly in using japan
now among the wealthier classes the long coffin has superseded the small square or round one but the smaller expense connected with a burial in the old way makes us survival of an old type a necessity for the majority of japanese
at an appointed time all the relatives as symbol in the death chamber and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse
there's no official ceremonial morning of parents for their children nor does custom require them to perform any of the last rights or attend the funeral
upon the younger brothers and sisters falls the duty of attending to all the last sad ministrations
when the body has been washed as as dressed in white in sil cabo ta whenever the family can afford it
the body to be placed in the coffin must be folded into a sitting posture and the chin resting upon the knees the position of the mummies found in many aboriginal american tombs
this difficult to us apparently impossible feet safely accomplished there are placed in the coffin and number of small things that the dead takes with him to the nest world
the single exception to this rule about nettle is that small copper coins may be put in to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death
last of all de vacant spaces in the coffin are filled in with bags of tea
so long as the coffin is in the house it must be watched over continually
it is their duty to see that the incense burning before the coffin is never allowed to go out while the food for the dead is renewed regular intervals by the mourners themselves
there are few enlightened japanese who will defend the present system of cruelty to the afflicted or who do not long for some change but so great as the force of conservatism and this regard so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack of respect for the dead that reformed advances slowly
individual instances occurred in which some of the worst features of these customs are modified
a case and point is that of the late mister fuca a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countryman in modern ways and who in his death continued his teaching
in his will he provided that his body was to be buried without washing in the clothing in which he died
through these growing feeling and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies
just before the procession starts a religious ceremony is held at the house which is attended by the friends of the deceased and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery
on the day of the burial great bunches of natural flowers are sent to the dead each bunch so large as to require the services of one man to carry it
sometimes with the gifts a man is sent to take part in the procession but if the giver fields too pour to hire a man this burden two falls upon the bereaved household for etiquette requires that all flowers sent beat borne to the grave by uniformed coolies who march in the funeral train
another favorite president at this time among buddhists is a cage of living birds to be borne to the grave and released thereon
it seems more like a bridal than a burial
during this period the spirit of the deceased is supposed to be still inhabiting the house and a tablet or shyness set up in the death chamber before which foods and flowers are renewed daily

not daring to risk himself at that place for fear of being given up he made her but a short visit and came immediately to goro

the church fells were ringing and people on the avenue going by to service turned curious inquiring looks up at the great house and then went on talking with the recent events which had so strangely entered into and made history in the city

raymond had voted to continue for another year this saloon

present of march sat there his usual erect handsome firm bright self confident bearing all gone his head bowed upon his breast the great tears rolling down his cheeks unmindful of the fact that never before had he shown outward emotion in a public service
what if he had begun to do as jesus would have done long ago
when had the first church yielded to such a baptism of tears
what had become of its regular precise conventional order of service undisturbed by any vulgar emotion and unmoved by any foolish excitement
they had been living so long on their surface feelings that they had almost forgotten the deeper wells of lie
the meeting was tender it glowed with the spirits presence it was alive was strong and lasting his off to begin a war on the whisky power and raiment that would break its rein for ever
since the first sunday when the first company of volunteers have pledged themselves to do as jesus would do the different meetings had been characterized by distinct impulses or impressions
and all through it ran one general cry for deliverance from the saloon in a tow ful curse
gray and his wife were besieged by inquirers who wanted to know what loreen's friends and acquaintances were expected to do in paying their last respects to her
grey had gone up to virginia's and after talking it over with her in maxwell the arrangement had been made
i amen always have been opposed to large public funerals said grey whose complete wholesome simplicity of characters was one of its greatest sources of strength but the cry of the poor creatures who knew loreen is so earnest that i did not know how to refuse this desire to see her and pay her poor body some last little honor what do you think mister maxwell
i will be guided by your judgment in the matter
i am sure that whatever you and miss page think best will be right
under the circumstances i have a great distaste for what seems like display at such times but this seems different
it happened that that afternoon a somewhat noted newspaper correspondent was passing th the g raymond on his way to an editorial convention in a neighbouring city
she was a common street drunkard and yet the services of the tent were as impressive as any i ever witnessed in a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen
it struck me of course being a stranger in the place with considerable astonishment to hear voices like those one naturally expects to hear only in great churches or consorts at such a meeting as this
mister maxwell spoke of the fact that the dead woman had been fully prepared to go but he spoke in a peculiarly sensitive manner of the effect of the liquor business on the lives of man and women like this one
raymond of course being a railroad town and the center of the great packing interests for this region is full of saloons
then followed what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service
it was one of the simplest and at the same tim one of the most impressive sights i ever witnessed
there must have been a hundred of these women and i was told many of them had been converted at the meetings just recently
there was no answer and after one or two ineffectual attempts phronsie turned fearfully away
i'll try and she laid a quicken and on the now
two red spots burned on her cheeks and her pale blue eyes snapped
i'm sure i heard it raging up and down
i don't want any dinner said charlot drawing back
yes indeed said polly cheerily just as fin as can be
assuredly said old mister king with great satisfaction and polly's pleasure and at her success in drawing charlotte out
and after this there were no more quiet days for charlotte chatterton
oh b me a too phronsie in placed surprise
yes grandpapa said phronsie coming in and shutting it o carefully i came on purpose to see you all alone
so you did dear said mister king highly gratified and pushing away his writing table he held out his hand
oh no grandpapa cried phronsie in a rapture i could never be do big for that so she perched up as of old on ning then she folded her hands and looked gravely in his face
while my dear what is it
as the old gentleman presently you've come to tell me something i suppose
yes grandpapa i have said phronsie decidedly and it is most important too gad papa oh i do wish it so much and she clasped her hands tighter inside
well then phronsie if you wanted i suppose it must be said mister king quite as a matter of course
oh she loft you everything she had pron the a papa of millions are so it is why
charlotte poor repeated the old gentleman
why no not exactly her father is rich but charlotte think they do very well especially as i intend to keep her here for awhile and then i shall never let her suffer pansy never indeed
grad p paa said phronsie wasn't missus chatterton in it to charlotte
if missus chatterton was aunt the charlotte persisted phronsie slowly it seems as if charlotta ought to have some of the money it really does
maybe said the old gentleman with a short laugh and i shouldn't wonder of cousin yunus was sorry over a few other things to phronsie
wouldn't it make her very glad if i gave shall mot some of the money
for answer mister king set her down hastily on the floor and took two or three turns up and down the room
oh i do so wish i might she said there's so much for a little girl like me
it will be so nice to have charlotte half some with me still no answer
i was writing a note to missus fargo said phronsie putting up her lips ricks

not to be ungracious the young anthony himself into a chair

for heaven's sake pickering cried his uncle darting and front of the chair in it's restless ach off don't say that again
i've been a lazy dog all my life and a good for not but i hope of not sunk to that
the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous fresh of a starry eyed flush cheeked young woman who demanded
where is he pete miss billy gasped the old man
aunt hanna's cheeks too were flushed in her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way pet had said miss billy's name
it was one matter for her to object to this thing billy was doing but quite another for pete to do it of course it's she
retorted aunt hanna testily as if you yourself ton bring her heir with your crazy messages at this time of night pet where he
interposed billy tell mister bertram i am here or wait i'll go wight in in surprisin
pet had recovered himself by now but he did not even glanced toward aunt hannah
missus billie miss billie you're an angel straight from heaven you are you are oh i'm so glad you came
it'll be all right now all right he's in the den miss billy
billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall aunt hanna's indignant voice arrested her billy stopped
pete go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receive us pete's lips twitched
but his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke
a flying figure brush by him and fell on its sez by the couch with a low cry bertram's eyes flew open
don ling found a there minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over bertram's tray
in the hall above aunt hannah was crying into william's gray w and duster that hung on the hall rack aunt hanna's handkerchiefs was on the floor back at hillside
then very gradually it dawned over them that there was after all something strange and unexplained at all
as if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closer burton was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable
why of course stammered billy i couldn't help thinking that maybee you had found out you didn't want me
demanded bertram angry and mystified
as for my not painting again you did' understand pete deary
she pulled herself half away from bertram's and circling arm
billy d a quivering sigh
good heavens is kate and this too bertrand's voice with savage now
well she burne a letter
billy laughed gaily but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes
and you never did think for a minute billy that you cared for him
he had not been slowed to marked that swift lowering of her eyelids
billy was so glad bertram turned the question on her love instead of arkwright's
after a minute billy stirred and sighed happily
you see i wasn't in love with mister arkwright
and and you didn't care speciall be for for miss went up
billy put a soft finger on his lips
bertrand kissed the finger and subsided hoo he commented
well what is that is that kate too demanded bertram grimly
there was another silence then suddenly bertram stirred
billy i'm going to marry you to morrow he announced decisively
i don't know as i can trust you out of my sight till then you'll read something or hear something or get a letter from kate after breakfast tomorrow morning that will set you saving me again and i don't want to be saved that way
i'm going to marry you tomorrow i'll get he stopped short with a sudden frown confound that law i forgot
five days indeed sir
i wonder if you think i can get ready to be married in five days
don't wants you to get ready retorted bertram promptly i saw marie it ready and i had all i wanted of it
if you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace ruffling will do it afterwards not before but
besides i needed you to take care of me cut in bertram craftily
the tender glow on billy's face told its own story and bertram's eager eyes were not slow to read it
sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm
billy my dear
it was aunt hanna's planted voice at the doorway a little later
we must go home and william is here too and wants to see you
you mean it'll be before october
aunt hano glance from one to the other uncertainly
yes nodded billy dem merely
yes i know that is a good while cut in bertram marly
we wanted it to morrow what we had to wait on account of the new license thaw
yet so strong was the effect upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectation of the wood which should make him rich
a part of that impression was due to the engagement which he must now fulfil
to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes
because in his salad days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many charms step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that raw attachment
unable to think of work he left the house and wandered gloomily about reaches park
he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marian who was fats instrument
he wrote to marian
will you let me hear or come and see
i scarcely thought of befo as likely to kill himself
but why the chuse did he go all the way hel there
i hoped he would brad me suds
poverty you i can only suppose
but i will see we dale i hadn't come across better for a long time
was he still so very poor
asked amy compassionately
i have afraid sigh his book failed utterly
oh if i had imagined him still in such distress surely i might have done something to help you
perchance his death was impart attributable to that hopeless love
he sent me a copy of his novel she said and i saw him once or twice after that
having this subject it converse upon put the two more quickly at ease than could otherwise have been the case
amy might take a foremost place among billing women
especially now that her father is threatened with blindness
is it so serious
even if mister yure recovers his side it is not at all likely that he will be able to work as before
our difficult is a so grave that
he paused and led his hand failed despondently
i have a good deal of will you remember and what i have set my mind upon no doubt i shall some day achieve
there was silence
the last three years he continued have made no slight difference in my position
recall where i stood when you first newby
just now i am in need of a little encouragement
you don't notice any falling off in my work recently
do you see my things in the current and so on generally
sometimes i believe i have detected you when there was no signature
her story in that girl's paper has attracted attention
and i could so easily put her rest by renouncing all plain upon her
i surmise that that you yourself would also be put a rest by such a decision
johann look at me with that ironical smile he pleaded
i couldn't go about declaring that i was heartbroken in any event i must be contempt for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgments are pretty sure to be unfavorable what can i do
the case is too delicate by fear for my advice
well i'll go back to my script
again jasp beheld the white soft hein for a superfluous moment
yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry
baron could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companions smooth countenance
she had divined that there was some grave reason for this sons and the paining with which she approached was half caused by the anxious beats of her heart
he began abruptly
he gave her such details as he had obtained then added
there are two of my companions fallen in the battle
i ought to think myself a lucky fell marrying what
you had better fitted to fight your way jasper
more of a brute be mean
here no very well i don't
i have made up my mind about our affairs he went presently
yes
will you marry them and let us take their chance
you feel yourself indispensable to your fathers at present
i should be so afraid of the effects upon his health jasper
she paused and looked up at him touchingly
dear i can't feel it would be my duty to renounce you because my father had become light
has one thing occurred to you
will he consent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is missus nor vane
and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him
she listened anxiously and reflected
as i have said there is a very serious doubt where the your father would accept money for you when you were my wife
it isn't your fault marian and well then there's only one thing to do
excepted jasper thy father is helpless i must find means of assuring his support
did you think them insurmountable
that is just what i have decided his impossible marion you shall have the plain truth
i don't trust myself
but shall you face them willingly
put up your umbrella marian
what do i care for a drop of rain she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is it stake how am i to understand you
everye word you speaks seems intended to d hearten me
why need you conceal it if that is the truth
is that what you mean by sayn you distrust yourself
we must see each other again marian
how a i to live an hour in such uncertainty as this
i do wish it
her emotion had an effect on him and his voice trembled
there is no natural more that a child should surrender everything for her parents
you know' so much more of the world than i do can't you advise me
this there no way of providing for my father
good god this is frightful marian i can't stand it
i will be faithful to you
he had made a pretence of holding his umber over her but marian turned away and wal to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a great tree her face averted from him
moving to follow he saw that her frame was shaken by soundless sobbing
in what can there be more selfishness
but i couldn't save on word that would seem to invite such misery as this
you don't love me jasper at that an end of everything
happiness or misery come to us by fight
is it in my power to make you happy
but if you had said you loved me before that i should have it always to remember
if i believe anything i believes that i did love you
what can you say to me more than you have said now
remember me as a man who disregarded priceless laves such as yours to go and make himself a proud position amongst fools and knaves indeed that wh its come to
soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merited my perverse pride would revolt against it
what can be simpler than the truth
it is a thing that happens everyday either in a man or woman and all what honor demands is the courage to confess the truth
marian will you do this will you let her engagement last for another sixth months but without how meeting during that time
that things to be childish
the rain fell unceasingly and with it began to mingle ann autumnal mist
just but delayed a ment then asked calmly
are you going to the museum yes
go home again for this morning marian you can't work
i must and i have no time to lose
goodbye she gave him her hand
they looked at each other for an instant then marian left the shelter of the train opened her umbrella and walked quickly away
jasper did not watch her he had the face and a man who is suffering a severe humiliation
his sister said very little for she recognised genuine suffering in his times an aspects
a few weeks ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest affection but who is very rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him
yesterday morning he received her final answer a refusal
you will understand they surely you needed no fresh proof how utterly a worthy he is of you
you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you
several days passed before there came a reply
i must only ask that you will write to me without the least reference to these troubles tell me always about yourself and be sure that you cannot tell me too much
we had then but little of that minute an accurate knowledge of the interior the covin which was requisite for determination of the problem
several different parties were therefore organized to examine the various routs supposed to be practicable within the northern and southern limits of the united states
the only discriminations made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficulty of execution of all the surveys
he inquiries were made with regard to gun powder which subsequently led to the use of a coarser rain for artillery
the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in the service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil life
under instructions from the president the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geograpical distribution
after some further discussion of the questions the visitors withdrew dissatisfied with the results of the interview
the quartermasters general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake and the appointee to the office had been confounded with his father who was a well known wig but that he the son was a democrat
i assured the general that this was altogether immaterial adding that it was a very pretty quarrel as it stood and that i had known a desire to effect a settlement of it on any inferior issue
nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the fox sound of very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size
if you want to hunt your hers on foot sixteen inches is quite pig enough almost too big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches is a useful height or even nineteen jes
it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule as color it is so much a matter of individual taste

he has of course finer but with the length of neck so perfect in the bigger hound the little shoulders of the same patterne and the typical quarters and second fives
and when he is fairly on a line of course he sticks to it as the saying is like a beagle
it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otter hound to get more size and power as their certainly was a welsh rough coated beale of good eighteen inches and an almost at dental contemporary that was called the essex beagle
that a great many of the true order were bread became very manifest as soon as the harrier and beagle associations was formed and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hound show was reserved for the

all things which follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of god must always exists and be infinite or in other words are each carnal and infinite through the said attribute
proof conceive if it be possible supposing the proposition to be denied that something in some attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of the said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thoughts
in its nature infinite
must necessarily exist
we have now grated therefore thoughts not constituting the idea of gods and accordingly the idea of god does not naturally follow from its nature can so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of god which is against our aphesis
and beyond the limits of the duration of the idea of god supposing the latter at some time not to have existed for not to be going to exists thoughts would perforce have existed without the idea of god which is contrary to our hypothesis for we suppose that thoughts being given the idea of god necessarily flowed there from
bear in mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from god's absolute nature
corollary hence it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is inns colic phraseology god is cause of the being of things as sind rare
corollary individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of god pore modes by which the attributes of gods are expressed in a fixed and definite manner

i was wishing somebody would give the conversation of start when indiana made a break

and you'll go on drawing and painting till you gets to be a great artist ran on polly enthusiastically and then we'll see something you've done and the loo maybe the louve cried adela oh dear me polly pepper
tom sell one had been very sober during all this mary chatter and now in his seat across the narrow aisle he drummed his heels impatiently on the floor
what's up little mother asked tom in surprise at her unusual manner it's says this tom
when the news was circulated as it was pretty soon that the party was not to be broken into it all till paris was a completed story the jubilation was such as to satisfy even tom
oh isn't it oates peas beams and barley girl cried polly as they watched them intently
and his long arm went out and picked a jack an end of an urchin who incautiously regarding such quiet travellers as not worth minding had hovered too near while trying to tease the girls
and presently a woman came and took little blue pinafore off and then the rest of the girls unclasped their hands and the ring melted away in the game was over
i'm glad the girls over here half fun said polly as grandpapa and his party moved off isn't it nice to think the do
two or three days of rest at marty put everyone in good shape and gave them all a bit of time to pick up on many little things that were behindhand
that's my third letter polly announced jasper on the other side of the table now i'm going to begin on joys
one two said polly counting why i thought i'd written three while this one is most finished jasper
dare said tomes delighted to thick that no terrible result had really ensued from his words that after they were out had scared him mightily
i'll post yous too polly give them here
then his face brightened and he said and she's right polly while polly fished or brig out of joe's little money bag that hung in her belt
do get the stamps pleased jasper and put them on and he took up her two letters and she gave the bag a little pat for jee sake wishing it was his stubby black hair that her fingers could touch
i don't know where we are going to get nice wit paper for around robin said polly leaning her ebers on the tablet and her chin in her hands i know ejaculated tom whirling on his heel and dashing out
i want polly too said phronsie wriggling away from the pennant polly held out alluringly
phronsie who hadn't heard what polly said her small head being full of the responsibility of beginning the important letter and considering since it was to be done it was best to have it over with as soon as possible felt a scribbling a letters as fast as she could all them running downhill
it's all right grand dad'll like it he said
i tell you you don't know my grand daddy he's got lots to fun in him he added
i won't cry any more declared phronsie wiping off the last tear trailing down the nose
then i shall be all as well as ever said polly kissing the wet little face
we must put him little pictures said polly trying to make herself cherry as the work went busily on
poll you always do think of the best things exclaimed jasper beaming at her which made her try harder than ever to smile
i wouldn't feel so badly polly he managed to a spur when phronsie was absorbed with her work fell ike could probably just his father did the gin bad boy
he seems to accomplished something every time he goes observed jasper dryly hello just look at him now
oh dear me exclaimed adela as her scissors slipped now you've joggle the table again then she caught polly's eye
rather not much obliged tom bobbed his thanks
picture after picture cut from railroad dyed books illustrated papers and it seemed to jasper gathered as if by magick with cunning little photographs broke up the letter and wound in and out with funny and charming detail with some of their journey
the rest of it is nice whispered jasper and a ventured to say that i'll like that the best of all
mister king thought so too and he beamed at phronsie so you did he cried now that's fine i wish you'd write me a letter some time
but what can i do so small and stupid and shy as i am
i must find some way to give the little ones a nice christmas
tume will like to have me goeth him and sing while he places harp in the streets
yes i will try and then if i do well but little one shall have a merry christmas
but see th it is cold in the streets the wind bites and the snow freezes one' fingers
she thanked ta and ran await to get ready for she felt sure her father would not release her anything
then she washed out little rance's frock and put it to dry because she would not be able do at the next day
she longed to make the beds and dress the children overnight she was in such a hurry to have all in order but as that could not be she sat down again and tried over all the songs she knew
when she had told her plan peter binary shook his head and thought it would never do b tessa beans so hard he consented at last that she should try it for what week and sent her to bed the happiest little girl on ne york
as soon as her father was gone ta flew about and put everything in nice order telling the children she was going out for the day and they were to mind tom was mother who would see about the fire and the dinner for the good woman lifts and entered into her little plans with all her heart
poor tess's heart beat fast as she trudged away with tommo who slung his harp over his shoulder and gave her his hand
it was rather a dirty hand but so kind that tessa clung to it and kept looking up at the friendly brown face for encouragement
see now have no fear give them bella monica that is marian will make the laugh whispered tommo tuning his hark
when battled french mood nodded to her and it seemed to help her very much for she began to sing before she thought and that was the hardest part of it
but tho shook is curly had and answered soberly yes i took you there first for their love musick and are of our country but up among the great houses we shall not always do well
but she had made half a dollar for ter divided and money fairly and she felt rich with her share
her hands were covered with child plains for she had no mittens but she had put them under her shawl and shuffled merrily away in her big boots feeling so gladly the week was over and nearly three dollars safe in her pocket
how gave the streets were that day
how brisk everyone was and how bright the faces looked as people tried about with big baskets holly wreaths and young evergreens going to blossom into splendid christmas trees
but i can't saw ill fill the socks all full and be happy said tessa as she looked wistfully into the gay stores and saw the heavy baskets go by
who knows what may happen if we do well returned tommo nodding wisely for he had plan as well as tessa and kept chuckling over it as he trudged through the might
we'll try one more street and then go home thou arts so tired little one
at the fourth some people at them say all their songs and gave nothing
tessa felt so grateful that without waiting for tommo she sang her sweetest little song all alone to
i ask mamma said rose and away she went into the dining room close by
as the door opened tessa sal looked to her like a fairy feast all silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine and tall glass pitchers and smoking dishes that smelt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfaction
ah yes i shall come with much gladness and play as never in my life before cried tommo where a flourish of the old cap that made the children laugh'
give these to your brother said the fairy prince stuffing nuts and oranges into tessa's hands
ah so kind so very kind i have no way to say thank you but runs u shall be for you a heavenly angel and i will sing my heart out for your tree cried ca folding the mittens as if she would say a prayer of thankfulness if she knew how
she got up early to see if the socks were all right and there she found the most astonishing sight

the senator took his seat in the pulpit with the minister on one side of him and the superintendent of the sundays school on the other
so od were they by the presence of a living united states senator that during three minutes not a spit ball was thrown
after that they began to come to themselves by degrees and presently the spell was wholly gone and they were reciting verses and pully hair
the usual sunday school exercises were hurried through and then the minister got up and board the house with a speech built on the customary sundays school plan then the superintendent put in his ore then the town dignitaries had their say

loch his eyes were darken large her cheeks or rosy her lips were made for kisses and for laughter
but it was not these charms in the leech gat they gave her mother the keenest joy
she felt cold with her husband
he was always fresh and cool with a frigid smile and wherever he passed cold currants saint move in the air

her mother's eyes glowed with passionate emotion
her mother went to hide
loll chica turned away as though not to see but watch tre much ga stealthily all the time

a smile of absolutely played on her red lips
l lunch goes getting near her mother's corner
her mother was growing more absorbed every moment by her interest in the game her heart beat with short quick strokes and she pressed even closer to the wall disarranging her hair still more
the lunch ca suddenly glanced toward her mother's corner and screamed with joy
through the half close doors he heard the laughter the joyous outcries the sound of romping
even fiducia felt abashed now for her mistress now for herself
he liked coming here where everything was beautifully arranged this was done by sarah ma alexandrovna who wished us surround her little girl from her very infancy only with the loveliest things
sara alex andron addressed herself tastefully this too she did for the lunch go with the same end in view
one thing sergey mod ast ovid had not become reconciled to and this was his wife's almost continuous presence in the nursery
it's dress as i fought i knew that i'd find you here he said with a during condescending smile
merely you see that the child should feeld its own individuality he explained in answer to seraphim out sandro pa's puzzled plants
she's still so little said seraphim ma alexandrovna
i don't insist it's your kingdom here
ill think it over his wife answered smiling as he did coldly but genially
then they began to talk with something else
that the mistress does it while that's one thing but that the young lady does it that's bad
why as fiducia of curiosity
this expression of curiosity gave her face the look of a wooden roughly painted doll
yes that's bad repeated a got yo with conviction terribly bad well
it's the truth i'm saying remember my words a gacha went on that the same assurance in secrecy
it's the surest sign
the old woman had invented this sign quite suddenly herself and she was evidently very proud of it
madam madam she said quietly in a trembling voice
seraph ma alexandrovna gave a start
the doc's face made her anxious
what is it fedosya she asked with great concerned as there anything wrong with luka
no madam said fiducia she gesticulated with her hands to reassure her mistress and to make her sit down
the latch as a sleep ma god be with her
only i'd liked to say something you see we lych go always hiding ourself that is not good
i can't tell you how that it is said fiducia and her face expressed the most decided confidence

you see madam mits a kind of omen explained fidessa abruptly in a shame faced way
nonsense said seraphim ma alex and jovian
who told you all this as seraph alexandrovna in austere low voice
nose exclaimed seraphim alexandrovna and irritation as though she wished to protect herself somehow from the sudden anxiety
what nonsense as though the lunch good could die
she saw clearly that there could be no possible connection between a child's quite ordinary diversion and the continuation of the child's life
she made a special effort that evening to occupy her mind with other matters but her thoughts turn in molar leads the fact that will lech co lub to hide herself
when the lunch was still quite small and had learned a distinguished between her mother and her nurse she sometimes sitting in her nurse's arms made a sudden rugg ash grimace and hid her laughing face and the nurse's shoulder
then she would look out with a sly glance
though she reproached herself at once for this unfounded superstitious dread nevertheless she could not under wholeheartedly into the spirit wh larch goa favor game and she tried a divert lochs attention to something else
she eagerly complied with their mother's new wishes
seraph ma alexandrovna tried desperately to amuse glug ca
perhaps but seraph mum alexandrovna she is not as strongly drawn to the world as other children who retracted by many things
if this iss is it not a signa organic weakness
survey ma sandro na herself began the game once or twice th she played it with a heavy heart
she suffered as though committing an evil deed with full consciousness
it was a sad day for serf alexandrovna
her mother covered her with a blue blanket
wh larch could drew her sweet little hands from under the blanket and stretched the a em brace her mother her mother bent down
she seemed so small and so frail under the pointed that covered her

i'm a mother is it possible that i shouldn't be able to protector she thought as she imagined various ills that might be fal latch ca
she prayed long that night but the prayer did not relieve her sadness
several days passed will lunch it caught cold
the fever came upon her at night
when sur paa alexandrovna awakened by fiducia came to will larch gun saw her looking so hot so restless and so tormented she instantly recalled the evil omen and a hope was despair to possession of her from the first moments
a doctor was called and everything was done that is usual on such occasions but the inevitable happened
and thea lunch that grew feebler from our tower
nothing made her so unhappy as the reiteration of fiducia uttered between subs she hid herself and hid herself our lile chica
fever was consuming mocha and there re times when she lost consciousness and spoke in delia
three days passed torturing like a night man
serf ma alexandrovna hid her face behind the curtains near the latch his bed how tragic
await ma mica whispered l loggia
much goa white face became blurred in everything grew dark before luka
she met her husband
spa alexandrovna was standing by the coffin and looking dully at her dead childe

you must resign yourself to your fate
she'll be up in a minute persisted serf ma alexandrovna her eyes fixed on the dead little girl
sergey loto stoves looked round him cautiously he was afraid of the unseemly and of the ridiculous
see my don't agitate yourself he repeated
he was confused an annoyed
her face seemed tranquil in her eyes were dry
she went into the nursery and began to walk round the room looking into those places where lo leech ca used to hide herself
she walked all about the room and bent now and b to look under the table or under the bed and captain repeating cheerfully where's my little one where is my loach ca
after she had walked round the room once she began to make her quest in you
pia motionless with dejected face sat in a corner and looked frightened at her mistress and she suddenly burst out sobbing and she wailed loudly
she hid herself and hid herself are the latch guard at angelic little soul
when she entered the parlor there were several people between her in luka
there was an oppressive feeling of heaviness and seraph alexandrovna's had as she approached loch ca

captain wadsworth became a little uneasy though he was still inclined to treat the matter lightly
we have severely refused to yield our charter voluntarily for it is the guardian of our political rights
that as true cuc and wadsworth continued mister prince and to subdue our stubbornness this f story has come to hartford with sixty earned men to demand the surrender of the charter in person
captain was with bounded to his feet in a rage and placing his hand on the hill of his sword declared he shall not have it
the day was well nice spent when he arrives and the members were engaged in a heated debate on a subjects of the utmost importance
he consented however to await the discussion but as soon as it was ended he declared that he would have the charter
after that captain had taken two or three turns across the room he paused and asked
what is the assembly doing engaged in debate
and will he wait until ins ended he has promised to do so
mister prince fixed his amazed eyes on the captain's face and read there a desperate determination captain heat again
mister prince bowed and hastily returned to the house where the assembly was in session
as soon as he was gone charleses steed and said
yes charles you will answer but do you mean uncle
never did the beaters take greater interest in a minor subject
what do you intend doing uncle will you fight them
remembered the worth must be done right at the time not to soon nor to late
the sun was setting and the captain said
come troughs let us hasten to the assembly
by no means but i want you to be fully i crested with a seriousness of your mission
take your place charles and be prepared to do your part whispered captain wadsworth
charles god is close to the long table used by the secretaries is possible without attracting special attention
the discussion went on darkness came and for lari candles were placed on the table in two set on a shelf on the wall
those two candles on the wall where a great annoyance to charles until it saw a man staten near them
though the lights were extinguished through the window the faint starlit dimly illuminated the scene
he followed him as rapidly as he could
the use was quoth behind him and when they were outsides used his arms
o i had a care how you approached me
the soldiers began the crowd about the house when at a signal from capting wadsworth the trained bents came on the scene and prepared to grapple with the soldiers
where is the charter
you have your soldiers at the door and we have the train bands would connecticut ready to defend us against violence
who of you has the charter
it was the boy casing range governor
every member of the assembly shook their heads
we do not know him he does not living com merican where does we live
little did the captain or his youthful assistant dreamed that their simple act would make the old tree historic
the tree in which the docking it was hitting was ever afterwards known as charter oak
it remained vigor bearing fruit every year and tittle a little after midnight august eighteen fifty six when it was prostrated by a heavy storm of wind
when the order from the seizure of the charters was first made known the sub ro island sent a most loyal agates to the king saying
he formerly dissolved the assembly broke the seal of the colony which bore the figure of an anchor and the word hope and mattered five in the inhabitants into his legislative council and assumed a function of governor but he did not take away the parchment on which the charter was written
from that time until the four union of the colonies for mutual defense at the birching out of the friends and indian war the inhabitants of rhode island or their shared in the deferent of efforts especially when the hostile savages hung along their frontiers of of new york like an ill omened clouds

it's a schooner said mister bingham to mister miner and she of the very heavy cargo
to this cord was fastened a heavy rope or tablet
what's that board for asked bert as he saw board following the table
that's the directions said how
they are printed in a number of languages and they tell the crew to carry the end of the key will high up to the mast and fastened it strongly there
oh i see said berg the lan will stretch then and the breeches bully will go out on a poly
it was clear day nail and much of the wicked storm had passed
with the daylight king girls and women to the beach
missus bobbsey missus minturn nearly and her mother besides dory at man where all there flossy and freddy being obliged to stay home with dinah ands susan
of course the girls asked all sorts of questions and burton howl tried to answer them as best they could
it seemed a long time before any movement of the cable showed that the buoy was returning
nearer and nearer it came until now a man's head could be seen
the girls and woman were too frightened to talk and nellie clung close to her mother
a big roller dashing and finished the work for the lice birds and a man in the corps boat banded upon shore
everybody gathered around and nelly with a strange face and a stranger hope broke through the crowd to see the rescued man
oh it is my father's she screamed falling right into the arms of the drenched man
but the half drown man rubbed his eyes as if he could not believe them then the next minute he pressed his little daughter to his heart unable to speak a word
and his george bringing out there anxiously asked the brother
safe and well can the welcome answer
i guess our prayers were heard last night
here come another man exclaimed the people as this time a big man dashed on sands
while i declare we did land on a friendly shore
just as mister bingham said that live saving work turned out to be a social affair for there was a great time greeting mary's father in how's uncle
and how on his father too put in man
what am morning that was it sunset beach
i'm so gladly prayed said little flossy pretty when she heard the good news
a beautiful day had grown out of the dreadful storm
and everybody was so happy
deep tim the vessel that had struck on the sand far was now safely anchored near shore and the sailors came in and out in rowboats back and forth to land just as they wished
then we had to go back to work at the logs went on the captain and then one of our crew took a fevers
that was what galena so
finally we had every wall blowed on the schooner and we started off
we counted on daring home last week when this last storm struck us and drove us out of our course
aboute the value asked mister bobbsey who was downed from the city

he made the clerks move all the trucks from the isles and i guessed everybody was gladly army fall down
the wonderful fresh air that these men lived in night and day had brightened their eyes too so that even the plainest feast and the most awkward man amongst them was as nimble as an athlete from his perfect exercise
i don't know how to say good bye you ney told dorothy andy next morning
oh that will be splendid declared nan
you are quite rich now aren't you remarked dorothy
and dorothy went up and day on the room whip the pictures of cinderella's proud sisters

come nellie called missus m gluck lan i'm ready where's your hat
we might be able to manage that too nellie told him
my uncle is a fireman and he can take us through his engine house
most of them i guess answered berg
well we have had a good vacation and i'm willing to go to work again

mister bobbsey was down from the city of course to take the family home and now all hands even freddy and ploss were busy packing up
there were the shells to be looked after the fish nets besides downy the duck and scoop the cat
and so our little friends had spent all the vacation

like them he is an novelist of torture
s him the last of cruelty the lust of destruction for destruction's sake is the most conspicuous of the deadly sins in dust sky's men and women

he saw his violent deeds not with the hand but with the suck
but one had noticed during this last two days that the other was wearing a silver watch on a yellow bad chain which he seems not to have seen on him before
he took a knife and when his friend had turned away he approached him cautiously from behind took aim turned his eyes heavenwards crossed himself and praying fervently god forgiven me for christ's sake
he never paints every man he always projects u tek or a night marrow dostoevsky
that is why crime and punishment belongs to a lower range of fiction than ane korner or fathers and sons
we sympathize indeed with the fears the broido that despair that succeeded the crime
he is a grotesque made alive by sheer imaginative intensity in passion
one does not grudge an artist and abnormal character or to
he invent vicious greatest as dickens events comic greatest

as for the criss themselves he betrays the old father and the eldest of his sons hating each other and fighting like brutal maniacs

it is easy to see why do ski has become a popular author
no melodramas ever poured out incident upon the stage from such a horn of plenty
dst ski is always ready to show them all in at once
on two opposite pages of the idiot one finds the following characters brought in by name general a puncheon prince s at a layer ivanovna lizaveta proper fiord na hear gen pavlovitch roon ski princess be aquam ski ager prince miskin qui e vulgar ippolit valuer fair decker nastasya philipovna nina alex jovian ya tyson m general e vulgar
but the secret of doer of skies appeal is something more than the multitude and thrill of his incidents and carters
mister marrow boled faces the difficulty and attempts of definition
to him dos sky's work is the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life it is more than a record of a struggle it is the struggle itself
and those voices take shape in certain unforgetable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly mean tavern certain surrounding darkness
ultimately they are the creations not of a man who desired to be but of a spirit which sought to know
because they have possessed they are no longer men and women
this is all in a measure true
to say this is not to deny the spiritual content of dust is work the anguish of the imprisoned souls at battles with doubt and denial and despair
there is in dst ski a suggestion of caliban trying to discovers some better god than sir tables
the ultimate attitude of dost dusky is as christian is the apostle peters lord i believe helped their might unbelief
and beyond the dark nighte of suffering and dissipating the night cross is still seized the light of christian compassion
or even by the compassion of others like prince miskin in the idiot
his work like his face bears the mark of this terrible conflict
the nobles of the perfect image of the man
as to the man himself the vicomte de deid vogue described him as he saw him in the last years of his life
when he became excited on a certain point one could have sworn that one had seen him before seated i bench in a police court awaiting trial or among baa bons he passed their time begging before the prison doors
at all other times he carried that look of sad and gentle meekness seen on the images of old stoic saints
thus a portrait of the men one sees behind oss p's nobles the portrait one might almost have inferred from the novels
it is a figure that at once fascinates and repels
he is not by temperamental singer
his musick is a still small voice unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and stall
truth to tell mister hardy is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet
he does not express life easily in beautiful words or an images
thus he writes in i found her out there of one who
there could not be an ugly and more pressa could sur that is contained in the image in the last line
and prose intrudes in the choice of words as well as in images
take for example these of the word domiciled in the passage in the same palm about
when we is strangers sought their catering care filed smiles bespoke their thoughts of what we were
catering care is an appalling phrase
is a line of good poetry
you did not come in marching time drew on and warm me numb yet lost for loss of your dear presence there than that i thus fan lacking in your make that higher compassion which can overbear reluctance the pure loving kindnesses sake greed die when is the hobo stroked it some you did not come
there are hints of the grand style of lyric poetry in these lines but pass lurk in your make and as the hope hour stroked its some a discords the bread tumbling to the levels of victorian commonplace
he has a temperaments sensitive beyond that of all but a few recent writers to the pain and passion of human beings
one can remember palm after pole of his with a theme that might easily have served for mister hardy too late christina the lost mistress the last rid together the statue in the bust to name a few
but what a sense of triumph there is in brownie tragedies
his world is a place of opulence not a poverty
to have loved for an hour is with browning to live f ever after in the inheritance of a mighty achievement
to have loved for an hours iss in mister hardy's imagination to have deepened the sadness even more than the beauty of one's memories
for then i u distressed by hearts growing cold to me could lonely wait my end's rest with equanimity
but time to make me grieve part steels lets part abide and shakes this fragile frame and eves with throbbings of noontide
and despair is by no means triumphant in what is perhaps the most attractive of all mister hardy's ponds the oxen
you pictured the ma mild creatures where they dwelt in this dory pen nor did it occur to one of used there to doubt o were kneeling then
the mood of faith however or rather of delight in the memory of fie is not mister heyday prevailing mood
he can enter upon a wall without ironical doubts as we see in the song men who marched away
how long he cries in a pal written some years ago
when tall the sin softer politian whereas we dreams have sway in each proud land and patriotism grown god luck scorned to stand bon slave to realms but circle earth and seeds
but perhaps his characteristic attitude to wars to be found not in lines like these but in that melancholy poem the souls of the slain in which the souls of the dead soldiers returned to their country in questioned a seniors flame mis to how their friends and realities have kept their doughty deeds in remembrance
and general hel hold out her sweethearts sworn loyal as doves
some fickle and fleet hearts and found the new loaves
and our wives quest another resignedly d they on our deeds
mister hardy has tree bitter a sensibility to believe much in a glory of war
the retell to mister hardy is the world of ancient human things in which war has come to be a hideous irrelevance
it may be thought on the other hand that mister hardy's poems about war i no more expressive of tragic futility than his poems about love
futility and frustration n ever requiring seems in both
his lovers like his soldiers brought in the grey defeated of their glory
lovers are always severed both in life and in death
in beyond the last lamp we had the same mournful cry over severance

the wrists were to make a shore drive in the salt grass
we were the only ones who did go afoot however although the crows were not more than two hundred yards as distance
between the upright bars of grease wood we could see the cattle and you're the opposite side the men building a fire next the fence
we pushed open the wide gate and entered

he could imagine what happen next
this is productive of s and fond of it fails
but now the brandon was full swing
when the nooses fell they turned and walked toward the fire as a matter of course rarely did the cast fail

weeping is accordingly sympathy with our own selves or sympathy directed back on its source
it is therefore conditional upon the caps you for love and sympathy and also f imagination
when we are moved to tears not through our own suffering but through that of another this happens as follows
either we vividly put ourselves in the place of the sufferer by imagination or see in his fate the lot of humanity as a whole unconquered first of all our own bought and thus in very round about way it is yet always about ourselves that we weep sympathy with ourselves which we feel this seems to be the principal reason of the universal and thus natural weeping in the case of death

for whether ad state man would have been mester a man
therefore in the stat innocence man had no mastership of the animals
therefore in the state innocence before man had its bade nothing d spaded that was naturally subjected to him
signally dais prove by the order of divine providence which h was governs in vary things by this superior
certainly this proved from a property man and bather animals
now what avers part pated is subjected what is essential and ii versa
therefore subjection of other animals to man is proke to be natural
they would now however on this come have been accepted from the mastership of men as neither at present or they for their reason excepted from the mastership or god this providence has mordan os
this is signified by the fact that god led it they inmost to men that he m gave the names expressive that their respected natures
so all animals would have a bit men of their own court as in the presents days some domestic animals obey him
objection one it was sing that insano sans man would not have had mastership over all other creatures
much last therefore would they have a bit man in state of innocence
therefore seems it is by this reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems petting the stat lin son's men had noted been in overplus
now a men reason has the position of the master and not of a subjects
i answer that we must need omit that in a primitive state there would have been some any quality at least as regard sex because generation depends upon diversity sex and likewise as regards a for some would have been born of others nor would sexual una have been sterile
there might also have been bodily disparity
the quality miles will rise on the parts of nature as booth described without any defects of nature
objection one he will seem that in the stit offn sans man would not have been ms over men
therefore in the state of ams sence m would not have been subject m
in other sense mastership is referred a general sents to ani kon of subject and in this sense even pave has the office of governing and directing free men can be cut a master
such a kind of mastership would have existed in the stances between man and men for two reasons
but in the state vincent's they would have been lowered miscible age
on the contrary everything generated ins skirting perfects but in theses pisan children would have been begotten by generation
therefore from the first they would happen in perfects in boy size and power
therefore in the state innocence there was no need for women to be born on the contrary nature's processing generation who happen in harmony with manner in which it was established by god
i have been told that mister van brandt is in pison for debt i said
and i saw from myself last night that he had left you helpless
he left me the little money he had with him when he was arrested she rejoined sadly
ku cruel creditors are more to blend th he is for the poverty that has fallen on us
even this negative defense of v brandt stung me to the quick i ought to have spoken more guardedly of him i said bitterly
i ought to have remembered that a woman can forgive almost any wrong than a man can inflict on her when he is a man whom she loves
she puts her hand on my mouth and stopt me before i could say anymore
how doan you speak so cruelly to me she asked
you knowed to my shame i confessed it to you the last timely met you know that my heart in secret is all yours
what wrong are you talking of
is it the wrong i suffered when there brat married meat with a wife living at the time and living still
do you think i can never forget the great misfortune of my life the misfortune that has made me unworthy of you
it is no fault of mine god knows but it is not the less true that i am not married and that the little darling who was playing out there with her doll as my child
and you talk of my being your wife knowing that the child accepts me as her second father i said
it would be better and happier for us both if you hot as little pride as the child pride she repeated
in such a position as mine
a helpless woman with the mock husband in prison for debt
am i to marry you for my foods shelter
a i to marry you because there is no lawful tie that binds me to the father of my child
that is he is he is not forsaken me he has been forced away
my only friend is it possible that you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife
the woman at my situation must be heartless indeedy who could destroy your place in estimation of the world in the regard of your friends
though wretchedest creature that walks the streets would shrink from treating you in that way
no what are men made of
how can you how can you speak of it
i yielded and spoke of it no more
everye words she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom i am had loved and lost
bitterly as i hated the man who had parted us i loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake hopeless infatuation
i don't deny it i don't excuse it hopeless infatuation you have forgiven me i said
let me deserve to be forgiven
it is something to be your only friend
you must have plans for the future tell me unreservedly how i can help you
complete the good work that you h the gun she answered gratefully helped me back to heal
make me strong enough to submit to a doctor's estimate of my chance of living for some years yet
a doctor's estimate of your chances of living i repeated what do you mean
i hardly know how to tell you she said without speaking again of mister van brandt
does speaking of him again nam speaking of his deaths i asked
why we you hesitate
you knowe that there is nothing i will not do to relieve your anxieties
never let me tell you the plain true
there is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison
yes this is his position in two words a little while sense he obtained an excellent offer of employment abroad from a rich relative of his and he had made all his arrangements to accept it
unhappily he returned to tell me of his good fortune and the same day he was arrested for debt
this mirrors that had been set for her was plainly revealed in those forewords
in the eye of the loss she was of course a single woman she was of age she was to all intense and purposes her own mistress
what was there to prevent her from insuring her life if she pleased and from so disposing of the insurance as to give vampa and directs interest in her death
thanks to the happy accident of my position though one certain way a protecting her lay easily within my reach
i could offer to lend the scoundrel the money that he wanted in an hour's notice and he was a man to excep my proposal quite as easily as i could make it
you are quite mistaken i replied
i am only doubting whether your plan for relieving mister van brandt of his embarrassments is quite the simply as he supposed
are you aware of the delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to barr money of ar policy of insurance
i know nothing about it she said sadly
will you let me ask advice of my lawyers
they are trustworthy unexperienced men and i am sure they can be o abused to you
cautiously as i had expressed myself her delicacy took the alarm
promise that you won't ask me to borrow money of you for mister van brandts she rejoined and i will accept to help gratefully
i could honestly thomas that
my one chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge to corset i had now determined to pursue
i rose to go while my resolutions still sustained me
kiss me she whispered before you girl
it is only your goodness overpowers me
the next day everybody the house began to make preparations with a journey
everything was done very leisurely though there was a lot of talking a disputing and the giving of contrary orders
the old porter was there directing a scolding the servants as they piled the rugs and blankets and bags of food and pots and pans and dishes into the wagon

as the wagon came up a young man who accompanied the holy man ran up and held out a begging bowl saying give o charitable people to this holy one

and again when the artist's following malicorne advice was with a little late in arriving and when saint agnan had been obliged to be absent for some time it was interesting to observe though no one witnessed them those moments of silence full of deep expression which united in one sigh to souls most disposed to understand each others and who by no means objected to the quite meditation enjoyed together
in a word malicorne philosophers that he was though heat knew it not had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in the midst of play and with desire in the assurance of possession
in this manner therefore without leading her room and having no confidant she was able to return to her apartment thus removing by her apparent a little tardy perhaps the suspicions of the most determined sceptic
but the door remained clothes and neither sight agnan thor the painter appeared nor did the hangs evenly
go then dearest love said the king the to returned quickly
no no not to day sire
i knew but too well that you had not ceased to love me
the valley with a gesture partly of extreme terror and partly as if invoking a blessing attempted to speak but could not articulate one word
at the moment however when the king threw himself on his knees a cry of utter despair rang through the corridor accompanied by the sound of retreating footsteps
the captains sitting buried in his leather armchair his spurs fixed in the floor his sword between his legs was reading a number of letters as he twist hiss moustache
d'artagnan uttered a welcome full of pleasure when he perceived his friend's son
i'll my boy he said by what a lucky incident does it happened that the king has i called june
these words do not sound agreeably in the young man's ears who as he seated himself reply upon my word i cannot tell you all that i knows i have come back hum
that the king has not recalled you and you have returned
i did not understand that at all
g raoul was already pale enough and he now began to turn his hat round and round in his hand
what they deuce is the matters that you look as you do and what makes you so dumb
said the captain the people nowadays the sole met sort of airs in england
i have been in england and came here again as lively as a chaffinch

d'artagnan increased his sharpness of his penetrating gaze which no secret was capable of resisting
you un happy about something he said
i am indeed and you know the reason vall weel monsieur d'artagnan
nay did not pretend to the astonish
i am not pretending to be astonished my flam
i have neither head noor arm do not despise but help me in two words i am the most wretched of living beings oh h
she is deceiving ill said d'artagnan dot a muscle of whose face had moved those are big words who makes use of them
everyone ah
if everyone says so there must be some truth in it
not for a friend for a sun
i dost take it you are really ill from curiosity
no it is not from curiosity is is from love
cut another big word
i tell you i love louise to distraction
well s'pose it were only that
no sensible man ever succeeded in making much have a brain when the head was turned
i have completely lost my senses in the same way a hunted times in my life
you would hear but you would not understand me you would understand but you would not obey me
o try tie
i go far even if i were unfortunate enough to know something and foolish enough to communicated to you you are my friend you saying indeed yes
very good i should quarrel with you
i never complain as you know but as heavens in my father would never forgive me for blowing out my brain i will go and get the first person i meet to give me the information which you withhold i will tell him he lies and and you a killum
and a finde affair that would be so much the better what should i care
you now assume me different instead of killing you will get kill yourself i suppose you mean very fine indeed
how much i should regret you
of course i shall go about all day saying ah
what a fine stupid fellow that bragge alone was
as great as stupid as i ever met with
go then grown go and get yourself disposed of if you like
i hardly knew who can have thought you logic but does take me if your father has not been regularly robbed of his money
growl will buried it fac in his hands murmuring no i he not a single friend me world
i don fancy's monsieur i do not laugh at you though i am a gascon
a carver there what do you mean
upon my word i could not know someone told me there was a carpenter who made an opening through a certain floor
why don't know where
in whose room them
i have told you for the last hour that i know nothing of the whole affair
but the painter in the portrait
why you sue to him only that name in your mouth
i did not suppose it will concern him
yes youre a right and he made a step or two as if he were going to lead why are you going
to loo for some one who attend me thee troop
who is that a woman
you wish to be consoled by someone and you will be so at once she will tell you nothing in if herself of course so be off
you are mistaken monsieur replied raoul though o and i mean will tell me all the evil she possibly can
well i admit it
and in point of fact why should i play with you as a cat does with the poor mouth
you distress me you do indeed
wait if you can
i could not so much be worse
ah said raoul snatching eagerly at the pan which the captain held out to him
how very fortunate that is he was looking for you too
she said the same tone of voice it is not i who am going to speak to him oh then
