a really was very much afraid of suing him how much sho i was that some part of what he said
his father dinging miserable circumstances
why it might have been in the work house
his father speculated wildly failed and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace
all his former friends sharp from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to gain his own moderate portion of wealth
no one came fords to helped the mothers and this boys
at least no friend came forwards i mutely and mister thornton is not one i fancy to wait till ti kindness comes to find her out

jean valjean had been in was straight the mess
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
to have himself nailed up in a casas and carried off like a bale of goods to li for a long time in a box to find air wither is none toc wise his breath for allens to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jo valjean's bluing tens
we surely must have a gim you will make a few holes herein there around my mouth and you will mow on the top plan pon loosely goods and what if he should happen to c for to sez
a man who is making his escape does not cough ors knees
who is there whose not sent toc cat do you come in
the over prudent cat's as they are and because they cans sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
but jan valjean's coolness prevailed o in spite of himselfe grumbled
if you was sure of coming out of the cable right i am sure of gettin with grave

the interment of mother crucifixions in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the instruction of jan valjean into the dead ram all had been executed without difficulty and there hadad been no h lets rem can passing that the burial of mother cati fiction under the altar of the convent is a perfectly vial offense in o sight
it is one of the thoats which reed on a genitive
the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of ing consciences

make as many nos as you preys m but keep them for yourselves
the prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
posta limp along behind the hers in a veryain contented fame of mind
jean valjean's composure was one of this powerful tranquility which are contagious
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
he played with further missin
he did' he with him you made him dance according to his wind
the permission for interment must be exhibited it
he was a sort of labouring ma and wore a wise cut with large pockets and carried matter under his own
the man replied the grey toga

educational fly feelings the says of duty the family are strong sents but there are no sents so vent as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first castle of love all the moreen because the scene so purer
the more girl believes in goodness the morees lea will she give wa if not too lover and vast to love for be without mistrust shee is without force and tow her love a triumph that can begins by any young m of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
then how surely must they desire the worlds which is hin from from them hows only must bey finds at tempting how surely must be listened to the first voice which comes to tell its secrets thwough their bars and bless the hand which she is the first to raise a corner of the misty veil
with them the body has worn out the soul the senses half burns up the heart dissipations has blunted the feelings
they loved by professions and not by instinct
when a creature who is all her past to re poach herself with is seen all at once by a profound sincere a ris civil love of which she had never felt herself capable when shee has confessed her love how absolutely the man she loves needs her
they know not what proof to givee
in ord to disturb the laborers in the field was one d devoured by a wolff because those whom he had so often deceived the long of the lef in his cries for help
this is the sam with these unhappy woman with be love seriously
but when the man who inspires this re deeming love is great enough and soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when his short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one drought all earthly emotions and after su a love his hearts will be closed to every other
but to return too the first day of mel song

the woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him
how why
my whole beam was exalted joy at the memory of the words beat exchanged during that first night
here on my orders tonight at vol val
conde the third and tre
the boxes filled one after another
only w remained empty the stage box
at the beginning of the thirds act i heard a door of the box on which by eyes had been almost constantly fixed opened and mug appeared
is shee love me enough to believe that more be theft boils that happer i should be
what is amu with you too night said marguerite rising and comings the back of the box th kissing me of the forehead
you should go to bed she replied with ironic arrow which went so well with her delicate and with face
where at hole
you've still love me can you ask
because she you don't like seeing him
n less al was very unhappy all the rest of the evenings and went awa very sadly after having seen prudence the counts and lovely gain too the carriage which was winning for them at the door
i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
you and a way marguerite but how
well you might had of woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arriv
during this remark marguerite looks at me attentively
my dear prudence i answered he d do not know what you are saying
yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came u as f as my door you will w to come up and as i could not m you i did not wish to lad you go away blaming me prosing no
because i am watched and the least suspicioned m to me a greatest harm
it is that really the only reason
if there w an other i would tell you for we are not to have any seeks from one another now
on sly do you careful me a little a great fee
i fancied for a moment th i might give myself their happiness for six months you would not have it you insisted annoying the means
well good heaven's the means were easy enough to guess
i listened and i gazed their marguerite would admirations
when they thought that this marvelous creature whose feet i had on longed to kiss was willing to let me take my pleas in her thoughts by part in her life and that i was not yet contented will was she gave me i asked if m desire had invaded limits when so spi as probably as min had been it reached after something further
truly she continued the poor creatures of chance have fantastic desire and in conceivable loves
we are not allowed to have hearts u the pal he of thing p down and of ruining o credit
we no mong of long to ourselves
stand first and therese the stain last in steam
never d ga you advice which is not loquats
in these little enough to them that we should have ten lovers e extravasation led out them and that they con drive in am carriage from time to time or come to our box at future
such a mad i founded the duke but the duke is old and olds neither protects mor consols
i thought i couldn that sett the lives which covered me o would do you have
what i loved you was not the m who was but the m who was going to be
marguerite hired out with this longed confession through herself fact on the sofa and d stifle a slight co pull up her the chef tor lips and from from that tora eyes
marguerite do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but in the name of heaven's tar up the letter which are rote to you and d do not made me leave you to morrow it would kill me
marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing it into me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
he it is i have fought the back
i to letter into fragments and kissed to with tears the hand that gav to me
look here pas do you know what wants said marguerite
he want forgive him
one has too but he on more than that what then
i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled

forthwith the grinning juster began sure king with laughter so that the bells upon his motley cap for all said a jangling

they soon elbowed him abruptly

educated people of the upper poses are trying tol ever grew sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social or
this is obsol andret
in the social conception of lifely is supposed the since the a of li is founding groves of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interest for the enters of the group
the sham int of the social conception of li usually try to connect the idea authority that is of violence with the idea of moral es but connections qui impossible
the man whose control by mal influence acts and accords with his own hiss
the basis authorities boy alce
the possibility of applying moy vis the people is provided above all by an organisations of armed men trained to act in unison and submissions to one will
these bands armed men said miss to a single will a a coste the army
the army has always been and still is the basis power
power is always in the hands of those who controlling an omen per from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army then in anything and court popularity of the ary knowing that that is on their side their power secured
indeed it could not be otherwise
only under those conditions could the social organisations be justified
the since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power al far from being sins through the very fact of their possession of power the social organizations basted on power has no justifications
even if there was w a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition of ment of violence the existence of authority to restrain such louse was an advantage because the viol of the goverment was lesson the vi of individuals when cana put see that this advantage couldn be lasting
between the members of one state sue to a single authority the tried between the individual seemed still less and a life of his state seems even more secure
it was produced on one hand by the national gr of the populations and on the other by struggling godless
after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to inter und ascensions and so sta conception of live justified itself
but this justifications never more than t ember
and te ascensions disappear only in proportioned that degree of oppression deserted by the authority over the decent in individuals
govern authority even if it suppressed private violence always introduces into the life of n fresh forms of vil which tend to become greater and greater and proportion to the duration and strength of the government
and therefore the a oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing af the fest lamone beyond which a choke i killing the goose with a gold nice
the most convincing example is be found in the conditions of the working class of our apo who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient times due that conquest
so it is always been
foot nut the fact that in america e wed aut thord exist in spite of a small number of their troops not only fails in his pre position deposited confirms it
the ever classes know that army a f the thousand soon be ins sufficient and d longer long on pinks men they feel his curry of their positions depends on the increase crank of the army
the reason too which he gave expressions essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the pops engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the rushing authorities of to days so carefully distribute ther with grips so that the regiments fromage and central districts and the regiments from the centre o stationed on the frontiers
the meaning if the privy speech putt into plan languish is it fs needed nurses fore and those but to b under officers to be ready togs the ins laved oiling masses
and this had normal order of thanks is maintain by the army
but theres not only one oven there other governments exploiting their such is by vile in the same way and are always ready to pounds down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its in slate subjects
as so every gotten thees an army also to protect its booty from its nea or brigands
this increases conan dags as montescue p as o about for the years ago
every increased in the army of one state with the aim of self defense against its subjects the c a sort of danger for neighbor states and calls for similar increase in their armies
the despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and extra successes andret ness of a government increases with its internal despotism
the rivalry of the european states and constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to the universal mary service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers whose obtained at least possible express
and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practiced that upon them all citizens had become their own impress
this inconsistency as become obvious and universal th service
in fact of the whole significant of a social concession of life consists a mans recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitory as of personal life itself and the trans france of the aim of life the groups of cress
but with universal mal ty service it comes to past that men after making every sacrificed to get it of the cruelty of strife and the in security of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had me to avoid
but in set of doing that they exposed individuals to the same necessity of strife sus toot extract with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors
the taxes raised from the people for war preparations of sor of the grated part of the pros of labor which the army ot defend
the danger of warm ever ready to break out rin is all reforms of l social like vain and fruitless
that the fain sniff ance of universal military service as a men off stationed of the contradiction carn in the sociate concession of life is not only apparent that
goverment a car g that armies re needed ab all for external offense but that is not shoe
there neither principally against their subjects and every man under universal tarry service the comes accomplice and all that ace of violence are the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
and for the sake of what and mak them
i expected for the sake of a states to make the sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and you a dignity
excepted a state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil dispose persons in our on country
we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish the number could that can only be done by change of en arma and mal influence
so thats justifications that stayed violence on the grounds of the protection gives from evil sloes persons even if a had some foundations three of or centuries ago has none whatever now
accept of a state they cals we should not have any religion educational cure m amun legation so
without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything
in this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
the grat extensions of means o communications and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with stat in fed societies association's corporations and converses for scientific ago and political objects
without governments nations of beens lay by the neb's
the government its with its army is necessary defends from neighboring state wh m slavs
and if defence ast barbarous nations as men one thousand part of the troops now under os would be a the superi with o purpose
the power of the state f from being security again fee tykes of our neighbors exposes is on the contrary the much grater danger of such tacks
evened looking at a practically wang that is to say all the birds laid all by the states no man can filed to see that for hem personal to comply with a state ams and servant the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantages than to af use you so
to resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not capable
so much for the advantages dad fag of both lies of conducts for a man of the wealthy class and oppressor
for am of the poor working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase disadvantages

in chair lisp beens order not sheet was to began of the protector that m so of people established over us
captain murdock
but mars port had flourished enough to kill it off
some of mars laws dated from the time when lawn force ment had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
the stonewall gang numbered perhaps five hundreds
even dar lax and failures hadad to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which e d out some kind of a marginal living
they were safe from protections rack a tears there none bo to comes so far outs
the shoot keepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protest tol enough to reach clear back to earths
captain murdock was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
the pressure was enough to get them for him
gord reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixt with a vague relief
i've got a free hand and were going ton the way we w on earth
your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
the first man making a shake down will get the same treatment were going to use on the stone wal boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
he picked out five of the men including gorden you five will come with me
the rest of you can tem any way you want knight pick any r that open though came and mc
br gordon grin slowly as he swung a stick and murdock's eyes fell on him earth co
two years gord a mined
for a second gordon curd himself
he began wo during about security then
nobody had tried to get in touch with him
there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim vose for ball glad when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
moving two groups of threes that opposite sides of the street they began their beat
there was no chance to save the citizen he who was tinging from whack a a
gorden felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands
gordon's eyes popped at that
he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
the other four cops had come and reluctantly
he brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys
they rounded it up the men of a gang and one of the cup started off
to find a fern and called a wagon
were not using wagons mord toot him line them up
if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were club carefully
murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulder shaking and tears runing down his cheeks
the captain's face was a sick as gordons felt
i want the name of every man in the gang can remember he told the man
colonel they kill me i don't know
murdock tok his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tufts
if hes turn up dead i'll know you boys responsible and i'll find you
trouble began bring shortly
murdock sent one of the man topick up a second squad of six and then a third
and the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men had had been beaten before
git a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
but the captain stirred finally sighing
now the cops are giving mere covered gorden
but the stone wal gang is backing wain
rust going to be tough on them
brisk gorden grist ave got yellow ticket from security
maro blanked he dropped his ey slowly
what m you think wain will be reelected
nobody wants him except a gaining of crooks and those in power
ever se a marsan elections
now your firste he can't loose
and then how is going to po and this whole plan may be blown why open
y fitted with the di of predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better fed from the fair rust dron around the corner
cost a morn but they be respectable
because is he is always honest according to have he sees its
but you got eh ideas of the stuff like i had once
the groups crew more experienced and murdock was trying a new squaw every nights
it was exactly equal but nothing was here
this kale too abuses as he seen on earths
but there probably wouldn be time fort if may wain was re elected
it was night outside and the fop for bobs at the corners col dim lane giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized piecing tess
it had probably been years since any hadad dared risk it after the sun went downe
and the slow doubtful respected on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that hay system was working
gorden hit the signal switch and the mars speaker let out a shrill whistle
gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
you can't do it to me
i'm reformed i'm going straight
y damned cops cant on mea was blubbering
one look was enough the work papers had the tell tale over thickening of the signature they had showed up up on other papers obvious l forgeries
some turned away as gordon in other co went to work but moas of them mt squeamish
when it was over the too picked up their whimpering captive
chinks the other cop had been holding the wallet
must been making a big contact and something fifty fifty
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
when gordon and jenkins came back mara tossed the money to them split it
whatever comes to hand governor
like this serial call gordon asked him
the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turnings sober not
youre me some bills governor
eleven hundred fifty credits
you didn't pay up your pledge to a captain fond so id a fill
a thousand interest at ten percent ay standard right
gord had heard of the friendly interest charged on the side here but he sick his head wrongs he
haw is he turned it over and shook his head
now sham me where i signed agree that say i paye back
for ast second iss face went blank then chuckled
he poured out the bills and handed them over
thanks his thanks yourself
the kid pocketed the money cheerfully noting
the little guy new mars as few others did apparently from all sides
and if fy of the other cops had private rackets of their own is he was undoubtedly the man to find it out and ms the informations with a beat such as that even going have and with all the graf to the upper brackets he'd still bee able to make his pile in a matter of months
the captain mook completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped into the bench
go on accept deal it
there was a mean coming from earth on a seconds ship he would see him
the little publisher her was back at the crusader again
only gorden and shaver left
credit had been established again and the businesses were open
gorden came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwelling spilt like the dome but opake for privacy
they had been lucky
show burs volunteers were official now
fats place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped too a stool slipping off his helmet
he reached automatically for the class eat the needle beer
thought he be the chips
thats mars g neck the comment why don she pu off the plan fats you could go back to earthy guess the other nob
guess a man gets us too anything hell may ian higher some bumps to sit around and mooed it up from when the ships come in and bough this is a real old martian den of sin
there was a grin on the other's face
finally got out orders for you you it's mercury
we setch foy others the same way and they failed
let save shifted some ofer the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
can't stay here
there's a rocket waiting to tranship you to the man on the way to mercury right now gord side

but his old eyes were gluing

a i o dread it i'm getting old as e you tell him
he graved gourds hand and wattle down the land in plank is he shook his head
