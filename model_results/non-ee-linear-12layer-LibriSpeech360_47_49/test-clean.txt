test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: stephen leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler listened to the talk about him which heron checked from time to time by singing

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the uncouth faces passed him too by two stained yellow or red or livid by the sea and as he strove to look at them with ease and indifference a faint stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallows swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their top heavy silk hats and humble tape like collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes brother hickey
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: brother ac card brother kiev
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: their piety would be like their names like their faces like their clothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts it might be paid a far richard tribute of devotion than his had ever been a gift ten fold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will find me continually speaking of four men petition whole vine turner an tin cut up in almost the same terms
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they unite every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them his colorists sometimes as cure os crests
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the cure eurus devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing unsparing light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by sign
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some of the touches indeed when the tint has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: does the head of a parrot with a little fler in his beak from a picture of corpus one of his series of the life of sainte george
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then he comes to the beak of it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the brown ground beneath is left for the most part one touch of black is put for the hollow too delicate lines of dark grade to find the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for believe me the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock robin is to be read and of a grass plot to be green and the bestest skill of art is an instantly seizing on the manifold delicious ness of light which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is enclosed properly and harmonize with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of entreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they gr dated justly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in this v yet copied from turner you had the two principles brought out perfectly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they are beyond all other works than i know existing dependent for their effect on low subdued tones their favourite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of great paper
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it may be that a great colorless will use his utmost force of collar as a singer his full power of voice but loud ord lo the virtue is in both cases allays in refinement never in loudness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it must remember be one or the other
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do not therefore think that the gothic schools an easy one
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or at least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden grown
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative than decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in facts you are producing jeweller's work rather than pictures
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in all early gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill drawn figures that is merely child is from failing works of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquillity of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purest painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you must look at him in the face fight him conquer him with what scat you may you needed not think to keep out of the way of him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the colorist says first of all as my delicious parquet was ruby so this nasty viper shall be black and then is the question can i round him off even though he is black and make him slimy and yet springing and close down clotted like a pool of black blood on the earth all the same
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great and spirit and in matter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you know i just been telling you how to school materialism in clay involved itself at last and cloud and fire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: here is an equally typical greek schools landscape by wilson lost wholly and golden mist the trees so slightly drawn that you don't know if they are trees or towers and no care for color whatsoever perfectly deceptive in marvellous effect of sunshine through the mist apollo and the pon
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now here is rat i ow exactly between the two tree still drawn leaf by leaf wholly formal but beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well then last here is turns greek school of the highest class and he defined his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the velma of it with cloud and fire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: only there are two sorts of cloud and fire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he knows them both
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there's one and there's another they dudley in the flinty
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is only a pencil outline by edward burne jones an illustration of the story of psychic it is the introduction of psyli after all her troubles into heaven
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: every plant in the grass is set formally grows perfectly and may be realised completely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: exquisite order and universal with eternal life and light this is the faith and effort of the schools of crystal and you may describe and complete their work quite literally by taking any verses of chaser in his tender mood in observing how he insists on the clearness and brightness first and then on the order
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thus in chosest dream
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature though suffering is still dignified and beautiful
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: every line in which the master traces it even were seemingly negligent as lovely and set down with a meditative calmness which makes these two aching iss capable of being placed beside the most tranquil work of whole vine or dure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but now here is a subject of which you will wonder at first why turner dru it at all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it has no beauty whatsoever no specialty of picturesqueness and all its lines are cramped in poor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the cramp ness in the poverty are all intended
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is a gleam or bringing down her one sheaf of corn to an old water mill itself mossy and rent scarcely able to get its stones to time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the scene is absolutely arcadian
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: see that your lives being nothing worse than a boy's climbing for his entangled kite
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it will be well for you if you join not with those who instead of kit's fly falcons who instead of obeying the last words of the great cloud shepherd defeat his sheep live the lives how much less thane vanity of the war wolf than the gear eagle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: also a popular contrivance whereby love making may be suspended but not stopped during the picnic season
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her ranging l tires and products of a tireless tongue
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: anger heee painful to hear
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hay fever a heart turble caused by falling in love with a grass widow
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: heaven a good place to be raised to
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hedge offence
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: heredity the cause of all our faults
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: horse sense a degree of wisdom that keeps one from betting on the races
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hose mans excuse for wetting the walk

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no matter then although my footed stand upon the fondest earths removed from thee for nimble thought can jump both see and land as soon as think the place where he would be but aha
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thought kills me that i am not bought to leet large lengths of miles when thou art gone but that so much of earth and water wrought i must attend times leisure with my moan receiving naught by elements so snow but heavy tears badges of either's woe
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my heart doth plead that thou in him do lie a closet never pierced with crystal eyes but the defendant doth that thee deny and says in him thy fair appearance lies
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you are my all the world and i must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue none else to me nor i to none alive that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh tis the first tis flattery in my scene and my great mind most kingly drinks it up mine i well knows what with his gust is green and to his palate doth prepare the cup if it be poisoned tis the lesser sin let mine i loves it and doth first begin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but reckoning time whose million accidents creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings tens sacredly beauty blunted the sharpest intense diverts strong minds to the course of altering things alas why fearing of tim's tyranny might i not then say now i love you best when i was certain or in certainty crowning the present doubting of the rest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: love is a babe then might i not say so to give ful growth to that which do doth grow
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so i return rebut to my content then gain by ill thrice more than i have spent
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was this observation that true from douglass not immediately but later on in the evening of reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call attention
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some one else holds storing up particularly effective which i saw he was not following
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cried one of the women he took no notice of her he looked at me but as if instead of me he saw what he spoke of
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was a unanimous groan at this and much reproach after rich in his preoccupied way he explained
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the stories written
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i could right to my man and enclose the key he could send down the packet as he finds it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the others resented postponement but it was just as scruples a charmed me

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she has been dead these twenty years
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she sent me the pages in questioned before she died
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was the most agreeable woman i'd ever known in her position she would have been worthy of any whatever
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ca'n't simply that she said so that that i knew she hadn't i was sure i could see
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you lazily judge why were you here because the thing had been such a scare he continued to fix me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you aw the cute
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he quitted the fire and wrapped back into his cheer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: probably not till the second post
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and was almost the tune of hope everybody we stay
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cried the ladies whose departure have been fixed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: missus griffin however expressed the needed for a little more light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: who was it she was in love with the story will tell i took upon myself to reply oh i can't wad to the story the story won't tell said douglas not in any literal vulgar way more the pity then
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: won't you tell douglas
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for if i don't know who she was loveth i know who he was
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall presently give
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: poor douglas before his death when it was in sight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't of course thank heaven stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a rage of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the first of least touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tail at a point after it had in a manner begun
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he had for his own town residence of big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in essex that he wished her immediately to proceed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up ball's time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i don't anticipate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was young i'm tried nervous it was a vision of serious duties and little company for really great loneliness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but that's just the beauty of her passion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was the beauty of it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it sounded a dull that sounded strange and all the more so because of his nain condition which was
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but was that all her reward one of the lady eked
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became everyday more brilliant and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: god as a directs consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yet these thoughts affected hester pryin less with hope than apprehension
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the child had a native grace which does not invariably coexists with faultless beauty its attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this outwards mutability indicated and did not more than fairly expressed the various properties of her inner life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hester could only account for the child's character and even then most meagrely and imperfectly by recalling which she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hester prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risks of airing on the side of undue severity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits but hester could not have questioning of such moments whether pearl was a human childe
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: beholding it yor was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has evoked d spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if spoken to she would not speak again
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he to pryin wet one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state bore though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest drank he still held an honorable and influential place amongst the colonial magistracy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and ax of state
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only cause a fierce and bitter contests in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have spoken of pearls rich and luxuriant beauty of beauty that shown with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was the scarlett letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the mother herself as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed dids form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the objects of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scar at letter in her appearance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: come therefore and let us fling mud at them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but pearl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they approached the door which was on an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were latticed windows the wooden shutters to close over them that need
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester pryin gave a summons which was answered by one of the governor's bond servants a free born englishman but now a seven years slave
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yea has honourable worship is within but he hath a godly min to with him and likewise a leech
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: y may not see his worship now
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of far estate in his native land
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on the table and token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind stood a large pewter tankard at the bottom of which had hester or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draft of ale
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breast plate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mother cried she i see you here look look
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and imitate tempt at shrubbery
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mister blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that half mythological personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a bull
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pearl seeing the rose bushes began to cry for our bed rose and would not be pacified
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he wore blue silk stockings blue pans with gold bubbles a blue ruffled waist and a jacket and bright blue braided with gold
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his hat had a peaked crown in the flat brim and around the brim with a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: instead of shoes the old man wore boots with turn over tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold bad
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of oz in which they lived
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when they were outside um simply lapsed the door and started up the paths
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the foot of the mountain separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the gill cans the path divided
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unc and ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of doctor piped
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hun cocked at the door of the house and a chubby pleasant faced woman dressed all and blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have come from a fire lonely are place than this alone near place
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and you must be ojo the unlucky she added
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ojo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we're traveling replied ojo and we stop at your house just d resting refresh ourselves
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the woman seemed thoughtful
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and one then stood a great fireplace in which a blue logs was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row all bubbling and steaming at a great rate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment i am please to say it is nearly done you see i am making it for my good wife mar lot who wants to you some of it for a purpose of her own
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you must know said margolotte when they were all seated together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mummy the witch who used to leave in the country of the gleans to the north of here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the first lot we tested on our glass hat which not only began to live but has lived ever since
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think the next glass cap and magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and they prove of some use to us
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm afraid i don't know much you about the lad ino oss
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you see i've lived all my life without nunkie the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that is one reason you are ojo the unlucky said the woman in sympathetic tone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think i must show you my patchwork girl said mara lot laughing at the boy's astonishment for she is rather difficulty explain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but first i will tell you that for many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cope the meals and wash the dishes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yet that tasks was not so easy as you may suppose
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a bed quilt nat of patches of different kinds and collars of cloth all neatly so together
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when i found it i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was wrought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from ty to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the emerald city whereat are princess ozma lives green is the popular color
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ojo examine this curious contrivance with wonder
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: margolotte had first made the girl's formed from the patch work quilt and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same gay material throughout
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck and several neat braids
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: gold is the most common medal in the land of oz and is used for many purposes because it is soften pliable
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no i forgotten about the brains exclaimed the woman
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well that may be true agreed margolotte but on the contrary a servant with too much brains as sure to become independent and high in mighty and feel above her work
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in the servant
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she ran to her husbands side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: their contents had all boiled away leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it altogether in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: odo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he selected a small gold bottle with a pepper boxe top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any objects through the small holes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: most people talked too much so it is a relief to find one who talks too little
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am not allowed to perform magic except for my own amusement he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe where a cook in stem and began to smoke
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the res it of os who used to be a humbug and knew nomadic at all has been taking lessons of glinda and i'm told he is getting to be a pretty good wizard but he is nearly the assistant of the great sorceress
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it truly is asserted the magician
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i now used them as ornamental statuary in my garden
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: dear me what of chatter boxer getting to be unc remarked the magician who was pleased with the compliment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: asked the voice in scornful accents
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince who indulge their passions and promoted their interests
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the edict of milan the great charter of toleration had confirmed to each individual of the roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but this inestimable privilege was soon violated with a knowledge of truth the emperor imbibe the maxims of persecution and the sects which dissented from the catholic church' were afflicted and depressed by the triumph of christianity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: constantine easily believed that the heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts and diocletian and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they asserted with confidence and almost with exultation that the apostolical succession was interrupted that all the bishops of europe and asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism and that the prerogatives of the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the african believers who alone had preserved in violet the integrity of their faith and discipline
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: bishops virgins and even spotless infants were subjected to the disgrace of a publick penance before they could be admitted to the communion of the dom fists
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: proscribed by the civil ecclesiastical powers of the empire the bonist still maintained in some provinces particularly in n media their superior numbers and four hundred bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: since the period of our tale the active spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements though none but the hunter or the savage is ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had dispersed the mists and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest when the travellers resumed their journey
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: after proceeding a few miles the progress of hawkeye who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinion of changeth cuck were frequent and earnest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yet here are we within a short range of the scars and not a sign of a trail had we crossed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: let us re trace our steps and examine as we go with keener eyes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ching gut cook had caught the look and motioning with his hand he bade him speak
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the heir of triumph that the youth assumed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: see said uncas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone towards the forest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if a rock or rivulet or bit of earth harder than common severed the links of the clue they followed the true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: extinguished brands were lying around a spring the offals of a deer were scattered about the place and the trees bore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the examination however resulted in no discovery
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the whole party crowded to the spot where unc pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist alluvium
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: run back uncas and bring me the size of the singer's foot
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: notwithstanding the hi resolution of hawkeye he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in his return to the camps his acute and practised intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of balum's asked to speak he was somewhat skeptical on the subjects of a beare singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was something in his air in the manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the ingenious hawkeye who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well known voice replied
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the truth began to dawn upon him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: come come returned hawkeye un casing his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion you may see a skin which if it be not as white has one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the young man is in bondage and much i fear his death as decreed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i greatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and i have sought a goodly him can you lead me to him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the tasks will not be difficult return david hesitating though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate his unhappy fortunes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very centre of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas wary but close observers of the manner of their captive
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: delivered in a strong tone of assent announced the gratification mis savage would receive and witnessing such an exhibition of weakness and an enemy so long hated and so much feared
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjuror to enter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the bar instead of obeying maintained of the seated had taken and growled
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the cunning man as afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hand he received they must stand further off
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then as if satisfied of their safety th scout left his position and slowly entered the place
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful wits
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and the singer as as good as nothing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the delawares our children of the tortoise and they outstripped the deer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: uncas who had already approached the door and readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but hawkeye who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself than to his companion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so uncas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well what can't be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy and love return david a little nettled that so direct an attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if you are not then knocked on the head your being an noncom poser will protect you and youll then have a good reason to expect to dieing your bed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: s chuse for yourself to make a rush or tarry here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: bravely and generously as he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it h becomes true warriors and trusty friends
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practice myself as one without a cross o blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: god bless your friend i do believe your sent has not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts in the force of temptation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features is he afraid
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will the herons hear his groans
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mohican started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he had no occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: monks cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i will endeavor in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: without his scrap books his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was absent mother more than an hour
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the only due cook at which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the alternate was that someone passing have observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in the chair wh i made a most careful ex sil of the room
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a broken tip of lead was lying there also
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay with smacks of something which looks like sawdust in it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to the best of my belief they were rolled up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door opened
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so it seems to me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now mister songs your disposal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: above were three students one on each story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his neck crane he looked into the room
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is no opening except the one panny said our learned to guide
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm afraid there are no signs here said he
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you left him in a chair you say which chair by the window there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the men entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central table
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as a matter of fact he could not said sums for i entered by the side door
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how long would to take him to do that using every possible contraction a quarter ver now or not less
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then he tossed it down and seized the next
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister palms was someone overwhelmed by this flood of information
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: holmes held out a small ship with the letters n n and the space of clear wood after them you see
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: watson i have always done you and injustice there are others
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was hoping that if the paper which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface no i see nothing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as holmes drew the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and an alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hm turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor hulloa what is this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: holmes ha it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i understand you to say that there are three studs who use this stare and are the habit of passing your door yes there are
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and they are all in for this examination yes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: let us hit suspicions i will look after the proofs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my scholar has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the top floor belongs to miles mc laren
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i dare not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by have occasionally done the same thing at other times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: did you look at these papers on the table
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how came you to leave the key and the door
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: anyone the room could get out yes sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i really don't thinking you much about at mister holmes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: only for a minute or so
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: o i would not venture to says sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you haven't seen any oft them no sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was the indian who dark sad appeared suddenly upon his blind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no names please said holmes as we not at gil her store
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of course he did not realize that it was i who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances runner suspicious
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that is very importance at holmes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you don't seem to realize the position
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to morrow was the examination
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with a situation must be faced
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings thereby
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the foul mouth fellow at the top
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he is the one with the worst record
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why banister a servant what's his game in the matter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no good my dear watson
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think so you have formed a conclusion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: look at that he held out his hand
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on the palm were three little pyramids of black dy clay
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and one more this morning
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in a fewe hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts publick and allowing a culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched think heaven that you have come
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you not him i think so
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no sir certainly not
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was no man sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon banister in the farther corner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: just closed the door said holmes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we want to know mister gil christ how you an honorable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for a moment gil christ with upraised hand tried to control his writhing features
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: come come said holmes kindly it is human to air and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well ill don't trouble to answer listen and see that i do you know injustice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he could examine the papers in his own office
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the india i also thought nothing of
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when i approached your room i examined the window
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no one less than that would have a chance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are where with several sharp spikes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he put his shoes on the table
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: gloves said the young man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how i told the truth mister gil grist
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had a letter here mister psalms which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it would be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if mister slam saw them the game was up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the debate between the senior societies her defend of the fifteenth amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not averse to charleston or new orleans
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: john taylor who had supported her through college was interested in cotton
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: better go he at counsel sententiously
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: might learn something useful down there

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: here she was teaching dirty children and a smell of confused odors and bodily perspiration was to her times unbearable
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies in reforms
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so for the hundredth time she was thinking to day as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cotton she paused
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she had almost forgotten that it was here within touch in sight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her stretching away to the northward
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there might be a bit of for try here and there but most of his place was such desperate prose
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her guards shifted to the green stalks and leaves again and she started to move away
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cotton is a wonderful thing is it not boys she said rather primly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: missus taylor didn know much about cotton but at least one more remarked seem called for
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: don't know will of all things and would re commented missus tailor literally boy and cotton and oh well as much as to ask what's the use she turned again to go

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the honourable charles smith missus sarah's brother was walking swiftly up town from mister easter le's wall steed office and his face was pale
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at last the cotton combine was to all appearances in assured facts and he was slated for the senate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why should he not be as other men
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was not herself un notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence and others

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: missus grey had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in m vividly their cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made her point of introducing forthwith
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister chris well express himself so cordially as approving of negro education
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do believe in some education asked mary taylor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i believe in the training of people to their has capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but crust well added significantly capacity differs enormously between races
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the banda pools were sure this and the englishman instances india became quite eloquent missus gray was mystified but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversations seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest scrutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fs a time hillo wick added dress well avoiding his sister's eyes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but we neither exactly welcome
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mary tao however related the tale of zu to missus grace private ear later
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fortunately said mister van der fool northerners and southerners are alving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he knew the silver fleas his and zis must be ruined
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was the first great sorrow of his life it was not so much the loss of the cotton itself but the phantasy the hopes the dreams built a round it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ah the swamp the cruel swamp
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly till it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was so strange in human a creature
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the world was water veiled in mists
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then of a suddenly midday the sun shot out hot and still no breath of air stirred the sky was like blue steel the earth steam
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where was the use of imagining
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the lagoon had been level with the dikes a week ago and now
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he splashed to step along farther and farther onwards until he nea the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then he looked down the lagoon was dry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green fifth tall wet in willowy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the squares of cotton sharp edged heavy were just about to verse to bowls
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for one long moment he paused stupid a gate with utter amazement then leaned dizzily against a tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he gazed about p flexed astonished
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite working pain someone had dot canal from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by long and cooked way thus allowing it to empty directly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost so
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the years of the days of her dying were ten
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: up in the sick rooms oa lay on the little white bed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the med and wear of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumbs speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strove for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: full while she lay in her chair and happy dreamy pleasure at son and bird and tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she rose with the fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forward wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she had been born within its porters with it his bo as she had lived and groan and within its border she had met her love
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island low the cotton lay before her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the chair was empty when he knew
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he darted through the trees and posted a tall m strongly but slimy made
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is a very fine old place of redd brick softened by appeal powdery lichen which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bringing the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables the windows and the door place
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the windows are patched with wooden tames and the door i think is like the gate it is never opened
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shutting with a sonorous bangs behind the livery lackey who had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pear
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a large open fireplace with rusty dogs in it and a bearer boarded floor at the far end fleeces of wool stacked up in the middle of the floor some empty corn bags
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and what through the left hand window
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: several clots horses a pillon a spinning wheel and an old box white open and stuff ful of colored rags
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the edge of this s box there lies a great wooden doll which so far as mutilation is concerned bears a strong resemblance to the finest greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the history of the house is plain now
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but there is always as stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beams and making sparkles among the wet straw and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cow shed and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow builded ducks who are seizing the a opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it as possible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where the great barn doors are thrown wide open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendence of mister globe the wid oa otherwise saddler who entertains them with a latest treddleston gossiped
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hetty sorrow often took the opportunity when her aunt's back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished services for the oak table was usually turned up like a screen and was more for ornament than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round pewter dishes there were ranged on the shelves above the long deal dinner table or in the hobbs of the grat which always shone like jasper
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do not suppose however that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance she was a good looking woman not more than eight and thirty a fair complexion and sandy hair well shapen like footed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the family likeness between her and her niece dinn morris with a contrast between her keenness and dynasts syphon gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a martha and mary
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a damsel came with a air shot seemed to take up an unfinished lecture as a beryl organ takes up a tune precisely at the point where it had left off
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the fact that it was churning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the widows and why consequently missus poyser should scold molly the housemaid with unusual severity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: towel appearance molly had got through her after in her work in an exemplary manner had cleaned herself with great dispatch and now came to ask submissively if she should sit down to her spinning till milking time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: spinning indeed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i never knew your equals for gallows ness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: who taught you to scrub a floor i should like to know
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: comb the wolf for the wood of indeed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's what you'd like to be doing is it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's the way with you that's the road you'd all like to go head longs to ruin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister at le's indeed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you are a rin p sitting down tor work a little while after its time to put by
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: money irons twit told these put it down to warm
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cold is it my darling bless your sweet face
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she's going to put the ironing things away
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: money i did like to do into the barn to tommy to see the wid od
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no no no totty had git her feet wet said missus poyser carrying away her ire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: did ever anybody see the like screamed missus poyser running towards the table when her i had fallen on the blue stream
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: totty however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run and an amount of fat on the nap her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and she was very fond of you too aunt rachel
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when she had that man illness and i was only eleven years old she used to say you'll have a friend on earth in your aunt rachel if i'm taken from you for she has a kind heart and i'm sure i've found it so
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and there's linen in the house as i could well spare you for i got lots of sheeting and table clothing and towing isn't made up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but not more than what's in the bible and said dana
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ne dear aunt you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work in their families
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we can all be servants of god wherever our lot is cast but he gives us different sorts of work according as he fits us for it and calls us to it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can no more help spending my life in trying to do what i can for the souls of others then you could help running if you heard little totty crying at the other end of the house the voice would go to your heart you would think the dear childe was in trouble or e danger and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i've strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my uncle in the children for anything i have done
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i didn't re reach without direction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: direction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i and a common patience with you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by this time the two gentleman had reached the palings and had got down from their horses it was playing they meant to come in
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: said mister berwin this stately cordiality
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh sir don't mention it said missus poyser
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i delight in your kitchen
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: poyser is not at home missy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: said captain donnithorne sitting himself where he could see along the short passage to the open dairy door
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no sir he isn't he's gone to rossitur to see mister west the factor about the wool
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but they's father and barn sir if he'd be of any use
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no thank you i'll just look at the whelp son leave a message about them with your shepherd
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i must come another day and see your husband i want to have a consultation with him about horses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for if is anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh sir said missus poyser rather alarmed you wouldn't like it at all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but you no more about that than id do sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think i should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know his farm is in better order than any other within ten miles of us and as for the kitchen he added smiling i don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by the bye i've never seen your dairy i must se you darya missus poyser
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this missus poyser said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her milk pans and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh i have no doubt its in capital order
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the paris planned like that at the crystal palace was a temporary exhibit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the london plant was less temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings and the vicinity of holborn boa
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there messrs johnson and hammer put into practise many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been been told
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the dynamo electric machine bo small was robust for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belong it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine seventeen years
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why if we erect station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there seems no good reason for believing that it will change
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: broad as the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them he is idiot sin chronically opposed to loos and wasteful methods to plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: everything he has done has been aimed that the conservation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could it charge storage batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but when it came to be question of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a farm mouse the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and is ideal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: edison was intolerant of cham and shoddy and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope test tube and galvanometer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: unless he could secure an engine of smooth a running and more exactly governor regulated than those evaluing for his dynamo and lamp edison realize that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister edison was a leader far ahead of the time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he obtained the desired speed and load with a friction break also regulator of speed but waited for an indicated to verify it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running and mister edison in formed me that as a reine engines started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: edison had installed his historic first great central station system in new york on the multi arc system covered by his feeder and maine invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against the strait too wire system throughout of the tree kind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success none alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact districts of large cities
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the strong position held by the edison's system under this strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of a three wire system and it gave an immediate emphasis to incandescent lighting
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was specially suited for a trial plat also in the early days when yield of sixth or eight lamps to the horse bower was considered subject for congratulation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the street conductors were of the overhead whole lined construction aver installed by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build an equip central stations
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three whar system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hot gins and mister edison being independent in venous at practically the same time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think he was perhaps more appreciative that i was of the discipline of the edison construction to pardon an fa would be well for us to wait until the morning the fourth before we started up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were later used as reserved bins and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of et assa but they remained in practically as good condition as when installed in eighteen eighty three
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the ark lamped installed outside a customers premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month an was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: edison held that the electricity sol must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a metre
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was infinite scepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject bare thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or wade and only gave secondary evidence of itself that the exact pointed use could not be brought to accurate registration
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hence the addison electrolytic metre is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the principle employed in the edison electrolytic metre is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the standard edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the metre room of the central station company for examination another set beings substituted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in december eighteen eighty eight mister w j jenks read and interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers almost six years of practical experience had up to that time with the metre than more generally in use than any other
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the others having been in operation to short a time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a divide basis
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison metre was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station some in current by metre
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the metre continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he weighed and re weighed the metre plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the problem was salt
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial pin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we had mits in which there were two bottles of liquid
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: here she would stay comforted en sue among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turn at the gardener who since polly's first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: every chance she could steal after practise hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was ceased to fly on the wings of the winds to the flowers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then dear said missus whitney you must be kinder to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if she could only see phronsie for just one moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh she's always that the piano said van she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at this the bundle open suddenly and out popped phronsie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but polly couldn't speak and if jasper hadn't caught hert just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool phronsie and all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: asked phronsie with her little face close a polly's own
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now you'll stay cried van say polly won't you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh you are the dearest and best mister king i ever saws but how did you make mammy let her come
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: isn't he splendid cried jasper and intense pride swelling up father knew how to do it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there there he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know gasped polly controlling her sobs i won't only i can't thank you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: past phronsie in intense interests slipping down out of polly's arms and crowding up close to jasper side
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop there laughing he did now truly phronsie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh now jap ser i must go by li very own self
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there jap you've caught it laughed percy while the others screamed at the side of jasper face
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: don't mind it polly whispered jasper twasn't her fault
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: dear me ejaculated the old gentleman and the utmost amazement and such a time as i've had to get her here too
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how did her mother ever let her go
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she asked impulsively i didn't believe you could persuade her father
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i didn't have any fears if i worked to rightly said the old gentleman complacently
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he cried in high dudgeon just as if he owned the hole of the peppers and could dispose that them all to sooth his fancy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is sixteen years since john berks and died
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his wife now lies beside him and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checker board marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the graveyards gate one can count a dozen gaily painted farmhouses the gilded weather veins on the big red barns ween at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the heir and the earths are curiously mated and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was a splendid figure of a boy tom and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's not much of a job for an athlete here i've been to town and back
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: abd ager you sleepily
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she gathered up her reins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: please wait for me marie an eel coaxed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i never see lose sighed over here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how brown you've got since you came home i wished i hadn't ad only to mam my orchard
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i get wet to my knees when i go down to pick cherries
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: indeed he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they think your proud because you've been away to school are something
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was something individual about the great farms a most unusual trimness and care for detail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall o sage or and cuds their glossy green mocking off the yellow fields
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: any one thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra burgs and
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is even a wide thrill of beehives in the orchard under the walnut trees
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: frank red english slowly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: marie sighed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that invitation decided her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh but i'm glad to get this place mode
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: just smell the wild roses they are always so spicy after a rain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we never had so many of the men here before
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i suppose it's the wet season we you have to cut them to
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i suppose that's the i season two them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if exciting to see everything growing so fast and to get the grass god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: argius flashed look of a spider whips all over the grass
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pail and he began to swing his sigh with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learn
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: marie picked cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering ranch after another shivering when she thought a shower of raindrops on her neck and hair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and am heel mowed his way slowly down toward the jerry trees
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that summer the reigns had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than chivato and his man could do that keep up with the cores the orchard was a neglected wilderness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i don't know all of them but i know b ne bins are
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if i feel that way i feel that way
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit long ivor colored berries tipped with mint pink like light coral that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he dropped a handful into her lap
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes don't you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh ever so much only you seems kind of stay at and schoolteacher
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when she used to tell me about him i always wondered whether she wasn't h little limb love with him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it would serve you all right if she walked off with karl
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i like to talk to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh ariel
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sure are you are and not thinking of going aff there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: marie's face fell under his brooding gaze
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm sure alexander hopes you will stay on here she murmured
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i don't w to stand around and look on
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i want to be doing something on my own account
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sometimes i don't want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the four corners of the divide together he threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerk so like a tablecloth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i get tired of seeing man and horses going up and down up and down
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wish you weren't so restless and didn't get so worked up over things she said sadly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thank you he returned shortly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and you never used to be crossed to me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can't play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly that's what you miss marie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but am il if i understand in all good times are over we can never do nice things together any more
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and anyhow there's nothing to understand
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that won't last it will go away and things will be just as they used too
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i pray for you but that's not the same as if you prayed yourself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can't pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i won't pray not to have them not if i'm damned for it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then all our good dimes are over
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: saturday august fifteenth sea u broken all round no land in sight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the horizon seems extremely distant
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am well his nature has resumed it sway
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you seemed anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye axes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one might be would less reason than now
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am not com playing that the rate is slow but that the sea is so wide
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we are isis in time and the facts is i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he called this sea upon and longed the way taking a little sail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i take this is my answer and i leave the professor divide his lips with impatience
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sunday august sixteenth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nothing knew whether unchanged the wind freshens
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but there's see no reason to fear
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: truly the sea is of infinite width
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it must be as wide as the mediterranean or the atlantic and one nine
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: these thoughts agitated me all day and my imaginations scarcely calm down after several hour sleeve
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i shudder as i recall these monsters to my remembrance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i saw at the hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i suppose professor liedenbrock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pick his eyes traverse to ocean from side to side
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: tuesdays august eighteenth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: during his watch i slept
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the raft was heaved up on a watery mountains and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there's a wale a wale cried the professor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of expressed trains
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: two monsters only re creating all this commotion and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can distinguish the eye of idea sur glowing like a red hot co and as large as a man's head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: its jaw is enormous and according naturalists is art but no less thane hundredth and eighty two teeth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: those huge creatures attack each other with the greatest animosity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: suddenly the idea sauce and the plus source disappear below leaving whar pool eddying in the water
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as for the if thesaurus has he returned whose submarine cavern
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the warns become lost in the distance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the weather if we may use the term will change before law
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the atmospheres charged with vapours pervaded with electricity generated by the evaporation of sailing waters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the electric light can scarcely penetrate to the dense curt which is dropped over the theater on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the air is heavy the sea is calm
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from time to time a fleecy tuft of ms we yet some gleaming light left upon it trumps down upon the dense form gray and loses itself in the opake an impenetrable masses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the atmosphere as evidently charged and surcharged with electricity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wind never lulls but to acquire increase strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir a fearful windy gusts and rushing storms
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there's a heavy storm coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on the mast already i see the light play of a lament saint ails fire the out straight sail catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but if we have now cease to advance why do we at leave that sale loose which at the first shock of a tempest may capsize us in a moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that will be the safest no no number
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the piled up vapours contents int the water and the air puts into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mists rouses itself into a whirlwind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: haran stairs night
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the under surface of the clouds there are continual missions of lurid light electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules the gaseous elements of the air need to be slaked with moisture for innumerable columns of water rushed upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i refer to the thermometer it indicates the figure is obliterated
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: is the atmosphere condition having once reached the density to become final
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the raft bears on still to the south east
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at noon the violence of the storm redoubled
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: each of us is lashed as some part of the raft
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the waves rise above our heads
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they seem to be we are lost but i am not sure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he nods his consent
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the far ball half of its wide half our blue and the size of a ten inch shell moved so it about the raft but revolving on its own axis for astonishing velocity as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: here it comes there it glides now it is up the ragged stump of the mast that's it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just skim the powder magazine horrible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk a mysterious light numbing leaps aside it approaches hans who fixes his blue eye upon it steadily it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a suffocating smell of nitrate fills the air it inns the throat it fills the lungs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we suffer stifling pains
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and how odd the directions will look
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: poor alice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with the pair white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh won't she be savage if i'd kept her waiting
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and yesterday thinks went on just as usual
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wonder if i've been changed in the night
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i almost take i can remember feeling a little different
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'll try if i know all the things i used too knows
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i shall never get touch twenty at that rate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no i've made up my mind about it if i'm mabel i'll stay down here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it'll be no use theyre putting their heads down and saying come up again dear
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm so very tired to being all alone here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and i declare it's too bad that it is
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wish i hadn't cried so much said alice as she swim about trying to find her way out
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that will be a queer thing to be sure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am very tired to swimming about here o mouse
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not we indeed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american stream line him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther unless me make him talk as he would talk today to americans
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: let us begin with that his commentary undulations
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the undertaking which seemed so exacted when viewed as a literary tasks proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was written in latin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the word had to be convinced
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a words should now be said about the origin of luther's commentary anden relations
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: much later when a friend of his was preparing in addition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my relations for instance and
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther addressed to wrists and the course of glens and roar prepared the manuscript for the printer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it presents like no other of luther's writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christ merits alone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the essence of luther's lectures is there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do loop too
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the word of our god shall stand forever
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint paul
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they said to the relations you have no right to think highly of paul
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was the last to turn to christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: paul kim later in as beneath us
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do you suppose that god for the sake of a few bother heretics with this own his entire church
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: against these boasting false apostles pul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person so the minister of christ should exalt his office in order to a gain authority among men
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pal takes pride in his ministry not to his own phrase but to the praise of god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: paul and apostle not of men et cetera
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: either he calls ministers through the agency of men or he calls them directly as he called the prophets and apostles
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: paul declares that the false apostles were call or sent neither by men nor by man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the most they could claim as that they were sent by others
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he mentions the apostles first because they were pointed directed by god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the call is not to be taken lightly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for a person of possess knowledge is not enough
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his spoils one's best work
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his coal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: im know nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were tus sophistry instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this is no sinful pride it is wholly pride
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in god the father who raised him from the dead
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the classing superfluous on first sight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: these perverts of the rightness of christ resists the father and the son and the works of them both
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this whole epistle of pall treats of the resurrection of christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by his resurrection christ w the victory over law sin flesh world devil death hell and every evil
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: first too
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and all the brethren which are with me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this should go far and shedding the mouths of the falsely pass
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: although the brethren with me their not apostles like myself yet they are all of one mind with me think right and teach as i do
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominate they go over the christians are
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why did they not invade the catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to godless princes bishops and doctors as we have done by the help of god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we look for that reward which i hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not all the relations had become perverted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: these means cannot be containin in
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they remained divine regardless of men's opinion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church' even th antichrist reins there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the apostle verse three
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: grace be two you in peace from gods father and from our lord jesus christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the terms of grace and peace are common terms with paul and are now pretty well understood
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the greeting of the apostles refreshing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: grace evolves th the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the world brings this of pernicious doctrine
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: experienced process
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: however the grace and peace of god will
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: men should not speculate about the nature of god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: was it not enough to say from god the father
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to do so as to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and to comprehend his infinite majesty
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: embrace him and forget about the nature of god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: did not christ himself saying i am the way and the truth in the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when you ague about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we are to hear christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at same time paul confirms o creed that christ is very god
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that christ is very god is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power do this spence grace and peace
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to bestows peace and grace lies in the province of god who alone con create these blessings the angels can nod
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and peace for my lord jesus christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the arians took christ for en noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mohammed also speedily of christ
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: paul's thous theme
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he never los his sight of the purpose of his epistle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not gold of her silver or casal lands or an angel but himself what for
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not for a crown or a kingdom or our goodness before sins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: under score these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how may we obtain remission of our sins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pauli seers the man who is name jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our since
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by own efforts
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this sentence also de finds our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single son
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the greatness of the ransom christ the son of god indicates this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but we are careless we make light of sin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we think that by some little work or merit we king dismiss in
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this passage then theres out the fact that all men are solder and d sin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin as a small matter easily taken care of by good works but we must present ourselves int to god with a good conscience though we must feel no sin before may feel that christ was given for ours sins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this attitude is universal in particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on the other hand we are not to regard them is so terrible that we must despair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he passes abruptly from persons the ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to men from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subjects an objects first and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the influence which the antonius has exercised upon austerity is due partly to a misunderstanding
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this supposed depths of this dial of the neal platonists found hidden meanings in connections with the jewish and christians strictures and out of them they elicited doctrine quite at variance with the spirit of plato
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly corrector sic in him his effort to realize in connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there isle danger of the modern commentators owd the tabus fallow unto the absurdities of the neo plat mists
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the present day we are well awar that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the fancies of the mule plad mists are only interesting toss because they exhibit of phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own dy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spit they are opposed to him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we do not knows how player would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the tilities which he has expressly connected was ever present in his mind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the dialogue is primarily concerned with any mal creation including under this t her the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but he has not as yett the find this an immediate territory which lies somewhere between mediciney mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great and impiety in ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with herit he acknowledges the perpetual flux like an exaggerate he asserted the predominance of mine although admitting and element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pits he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: many if not all the aliments of the pris critic philosophy are included in the times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the ideas also remained but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the style and plan of the tus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the features or span
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nothing can exceeded the beauty were art of the introduction in which his using words after his accustomed manner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it could writ in one style but not in another the greek language had not as yet in fashioned by any poet or philosophers to describe physical phenomena
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and hence we find the same sort of quintin in the teas of plato which characterizes to philosophical poem of lucretius
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is a want of flow and often a defect of ribbon the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of that position and more of repetition than occurs in plates earlier writings
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce the perfect work of ar
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: socrates begins totin with a summary of the republic
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and now he desires to see the ideal state set in motion he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and therefore to you i turn to mus citizen of locris whar at once a philosophers in a statesmen and to you courteous whom all athenians knowe to be similarly accomplished and to hermocrates who also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i will atty as it brooms i prove
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: listen then socrates to a tale of solace who being the friend of troves my great grandfather told it to my grandfather courteous and he told me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some poems of solemn were recited by the boys
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and what was the subject of the polar said the person who made the remark
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the subject was a very noble one he described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever engaged
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with the memory of their exploits have passed away owing to the lapse of time in the extinction of the actors
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: tell us said the other the whole story and where solid he the story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in egypts the traditions of our own and other lands are by os registered forever in our temples
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the genealogies we sh have recited to us although your own anal solemn our a mere children's story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for in the times before the great flood athens was the greatest and best of cities and dead the noblest deeds and had the best constitution of any under deface of heaven
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: solemn marvelled and desire to be informed of the particulars
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nine thousand years have e lapsed since she founded yours and eight thousand since she founded ours as are animal's record
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: many laws exists among this which i the counter part of yours as they were in the olden time'
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i will briefly describe them to you and shall read the account of them as your leisure in the sacred registers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: observed again what care a law t hook in the pursuit of wisdom searching out the deed things of the world and applying them to the use of men
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of the plants
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for at the peril of her own existence and when the other howlings had deserted her she repelled invader and off her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this is the explanation of the shallows which are found in that heart of the atlantic ocean
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but i would not speak at the time because i wanted to refresh lay memory
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first genus is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of men and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of one will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost p thean citizens are wh the egyptian records spoke
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but already at pointed economical evolution far and stating the emergence of the lady specialized consumptions of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a moral less elaborate system
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the utility of consumptions as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: such consumption as false to the women is nearly incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labor and not the consumption directed to their own comfort and fullness of life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with a further vance and counter this to bloom changed into simple custom of a mor oral less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it beat a boo or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leger class
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: under the to b certain victuals and m particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free us of stimulants there attend in their turn to become honorific as being remark at the second remove of the superior states of those who are able to afford the indulgence
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the consumption of luxuries in the truce sense his consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with many qualifications if more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradual a weakened the generals rule is fell to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the objection of cause presents itself that expenditure on women's stress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rue but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious and substantial
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of con reality and religion these motives are also present in the later development the they do not continue to be the sole motives
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is moralist elaborate system of ranking grates
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this differentiation is further by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are the same time mess men of substance in their own right so that some of them must scarce let all others only partially to beated as li caroused consumers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: se many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be cas as vicarious consumer without qualification
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: many of these again and also many of the other aristocracy of lest degree having turned attached to the persons amore or less comprehensive group of by car consumer in the persons of their wives and children their servants retainers et cetera
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wearing of uniforms a liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of certitude real are ostensible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wearers of uniforms and liveries may be record divided into two classes the free and the survive or the noble and the ignoble
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so those offices which are by wight the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the car of ams and acquirements and the like in short those which may be class as su ostensibly predatory employments
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: whenever as in these cases the menial serves in question has to do directly with a prime re leisure employments of fighting in hunting it easily acquires a affected honorific character
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the livery becomes obnoxious to meanly all who are required to wear it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in a general way though not wholly all consistently these two groups coin sight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the dependent who was first delegate for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected dilated development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these due accustomary performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of o cius leisure in consumption devolve upon the wife alone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the communities of the western countree this point is at present found among the lower middle class
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if beauty comforted achieved and it is a moralist forte is circumstances fair they must be achieved by means and methods that comme themselves to the great economical law of hoisted effort
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the man of the household also can do something in dis direction and indeedy commonly does that with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence among the margin of the slums the man un presently also the children virtually ceased to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains s virtually the sol exponent of the household's pecuniary decency
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: very much of squalor and discomfort will be endued before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decencies put away
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is no class or no country that as yielded so objected before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual neat
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desire to effect
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: each will there for serve about equally well during the ear neer states of social growth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the modern organizations of industry works in the same direction also bye other line
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of high thing the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is also noticeable that the serviceability consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is that its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individually iss widest and the mobility of the population is greatest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: consumptions becomes larger element in the standard of living in the city on in the country
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: among the country preparation its places to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighbor gossiped sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the result is a great ability of the neighbor employed in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising which should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary elation pretty evenly between them at the outset
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came told the rank ferment above wasteful consumption of goods both as it direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the course i peaceful culture
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: are the circumstance permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and almost ever is of human us
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by resort to make belief men an intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations su found it with some specious object of amelioration and boded in their official stolen title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the ends that the talk is may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economics value of their traffic
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the sailing features of the development of domestics serves have already been indicated
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: throughout the entire revolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods of services or human life runs the obvious invocation that in order to effectually men the consume as goods thing it must be an expenditure of superfluities
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as use in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ance sought by the con humor under this canon of conspicuous waste
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but it is on another grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what dis characterise a wasteful
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste at such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of a invidious pecuniary comparison
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: an art to a maybe useful and wasteful both and its cit lit to consumer may be made of us and waste in the most varying props
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and often has my mother said while on her lap i laid my head she feared for time i was not made but for eternity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why are we to be denyed each other society
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why are a we to be divided
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: surely it must be because we're in danger of loving each other too well of losing sid of the creator and idolatry of the creature
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we used to dispute about politics and religion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she adoring clergyman's daughter was always in a minority of one in our house of violent descent and radicalism
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her feeble health gave her her yielding manner for she could never oppose anyone without gathering up all her strength for the struggle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he spoke french perfectly i been told when need was but delighted usually in talking the broadest yorkshire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent radicals and dissenters into which twenty years ago of a little quiet resolute clergyman's daughter was received and by whom she was truly loved an honoured
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: january and february of eighteen thirty seven had passed away and still there was no reply from selli
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am not depreciating it when i say that in these times it is not rare
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but it is not with of you to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you consul your unhappiness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will say that a woman has no need of such a caution there can be no peril in it for her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the more she is engaged in her proper duties the last leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and the recreation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to those duties you have not yet been called and when you are you will be less eager for celebrity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but do not suppose that i despair to the gifts which you possess nor that i would discord you from exercising it i only exhort you so to think of it and so to use it as to render it conducive to your own permanent good
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: farewell madame
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: though i may be but an ungracious adviser you will allow me therefore to subscribe myself with the best wishes for your happiness here and hereafter your tre offend wile bert selby
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sir march sixteenth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i have not ventured to hope for such reply so considerate in its tone so noble in its spirit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know the first letter i wrote to you is all senseless trash from beginning to end but i am not altogether the idle dreaming being it would seem to denote
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i thought it therefore my duty when i left school to become a governess

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it must be owned and no one was more ready to confess it than himself that his literary attainments were by no means of a high order
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we don't spin tops is a favorite saying amongst artillery officers indicating that they do not shirk their duty by frivolous pursuits but it must be confessed that servadac being naturally idle was very much given to dinning tops

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the bond of union thus effected could never be severed and although ben z's achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement he firmly declined all honours or any pension that might part him from his superior officer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: unlike his master he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power but his inexhaustible memory made him a living encyclopedia and for his stock of anecdotes and trooper's tales he was matchless
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fast as his legs could carry him servadac had made his way to the top of the cliff
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was quite true than a vessel was in sight hardly more than six miles from the shore but owing to the increase in the earth's convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision the rigging of the topmasts alone was visible above the water
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: exclaimed servadac keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she is under sale but she is counted t chefs yacht he was right

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wind being adverse the dobryna did not make very rapid progress but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained calm and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold a steady course
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: servadac took it for granted that the dobryna was endeavouring to put in
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the roughest weather would insure the calmness of its waters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: slightly changing her course she first struck her main sail and an orge of facilitate the movements of her helmsman soon carried nothing but her two topsails brigantine and jib

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nothing more than you knows yourself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: are you certain that this is the mediterranean
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for some moments he seemed perfectly stupified and then recovering himself he began to overwhelmed the count with a torrent of questions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to all these inquiries the count responded in the affirmative
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will take me on board count will you not
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my yacht is at your service sir even should you require to make a tour round the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the count shook his head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: before starting it was indispensible that the engine of the dobryna should be repaired to sail under canvas only would in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficulty
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was on the last day of january that the repairs of the schooner were completed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: doubts now arose and some discussion followed whether or not it was desirable for bends to accompany his master
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her seagoing qualities were excellent and would an amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: after an apprentices ship on a merchantship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the late astounding events however had rendered procope manifestly uneasy and not the last so from his consciousness that the counts secretly partook of his own anxiety
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: steam up and canvas spread the schooner started eastwards
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earths attraction rendering the liquid particle so buoyant that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of algeria but no land appeared to the south
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the log and the compass therefore were able to be called upon to do the work of the sexton which had become utterly useless
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there's no fear of that sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that the earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit but she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipitated on to the sun
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and what demonstration do you offer asked servadac eagerly that it will not happen
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ocean reigned supreme
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts sped away to his native france only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the algerian metropolis
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: is it not impossible he murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: another circumstance was most remarkable
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniformed depth of from fortify fathoms and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the sight of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheatre
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you must see you lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you imagined
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: after pondering a while he said if we were farther away i should expect to find a depth of two or three hundreds fathoms instead of five fathoms five fathoms
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: its depth remained invariable still four or at most five fathoms and although its bottom was assiduously dredged it was only to prove it baron of marine production of any type
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nothing was to be done but to put about and return and disappointment towards the north

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: women can hide their ping better than we men and bear it better too except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but poor rachel lak had more thane that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this transient spring and lighting up are beautiful a glamour beguiling our senses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was something of sweetness and thoughtless in her tones and manner which was new rachel and comforting and she returned the grating as kindly and felt more like her form herself

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i have very few to love me now and i thought you might love me as i have begun to love you

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to game well's chamber
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will cried he softly and steadily who had chose in his count across the door of his young master's chamber sprang up at once in answer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we will go out together to the bower there is a way down to the court from my window
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: rest and be still until i warn you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hours passed wearily by and move it could yet be heard about the hall
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at last all was quiet and blacken the courtyard of gamewell
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will whispered robin opening his doors he spoke are you ready
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they then renewed their journey and under the better light made a save crossing of the stable roofs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: robin entered the hot dragging the unwilling esquire after him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: be not so foolish friend said fifths sooth crossly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they moved thereafter cautiously about the hut groping before an about them to find something to show that the morton had fulfilled his mission
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stuffy had tripped over the edge of the reversed flat mouth of this pit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fitzooth's hand rested at last upon the top wrung of the ladder and slowly the truth came to him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: robin carefully descended the latter and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: stuffily was by his side in the flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and character of this vault
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice warrant ands
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: save me masters but you startled me rarely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cried he waving the lantern before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: inquired robin with his suspicion still upon him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: truly such a horse would be worth much and notting him fare
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: day nay lording answered warrant and with a half laugh
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: warrant and spoke thus with significance to show robin that he was not to thank jeffrey's claims to the estate would be passed by
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: robin fits sooth saw that his doubts of warrant and had been unfair and he became ashamed of himself for harbouring them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his tones rang pleasantly on warrenton's ears and forthwith a good fellowship was heralded between them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gave well that this passageway led from the hut in a pleasant to sherwood and that jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he implores us to be discreet as the grave in this matter for in soothe his life is in the hollow of ours hands
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they regained their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gamewell
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: out in the wood stood a nice little fir tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the place he had was a very good one the sun shone on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as furs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he did not think of the warms sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cotta children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but this was what the tree could not bear to hear
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hair would often come leaping along and jumped right over the little tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh that made him so angry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to grow and grow to get o er and be tall thought the tree f after all is the most of light fulfil in the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in autumn the wood cutters always came and fells of the largest trees
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this happened every year and the young fir tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees felled the earth with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and bare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were lading carts and the horses dragged of them out of the wood
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: have you not met them anyone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: rejoice and th growth said the sunbeams
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and then what happens then
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i would fain now if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where i but al ready on the cart
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where i in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes and something better something still preter will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ornament me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: something better something still grander must follow but what
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with choice in our presents so the air and the sunlight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: rejoice in my own fresh youth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winters in summer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and towards christmas he was l of the first that was caught down
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the axe struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pangs like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful that being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the departure was not at all agreeable
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the tri only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyards with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we won't want the others
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there too were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture box and full of toys worth hundreds in the hundreds of crowns at least the children at so
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this evening they all said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how it will shine mis evening
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: perhaps the other trees from the forests will come to to book at me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it blazed up famously help help
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cried the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but i shall tell only one story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: humpy don't be fell downstairs an yet he married the princess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's the way of the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thought the fir tree and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i won't tremble to morrow thought the firry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the morning the servants and the housemaid came in
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what's the meaning of this thought the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks and a corner out of the way
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: tis now winter out of doors thought the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how kind man is after all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if only we not so dark here and so terribly lonely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sleep s creak
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they snuffed about the fir tree and rustled amongst the branches
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i amby no means old said the fir tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there's many a one considerably older than i am
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were so extremely curious
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i knows no such place said the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: said the fir tree thinking over what he had himself related
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes in reality those more happy times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: who is oi d asked the mice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: only that one answered the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is a very s stupid story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: don't you know one about bacon and tallow candles can'st you tell any larder stories
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no said the tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then goodby said the rats and they went home
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all it was very pleasant when the sleek little my sat round me and listened to what i told them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now that two is over
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but it was not the fir try that they meant
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and metals
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the golden star of tinsel was still on a top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the courtyards some of the married children were playing who had danced at christmas round the fir tree and were so glad at the sight of him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the gardener's boy chopped g tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and its side so deeply
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: goeth them beth refrained from dulling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogers visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned who closely aboute penalty for forging a check
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was a serious crim in deep mister watson told him and on gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in the states prison as a consequence of his rash aft
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i gain see it in that light said the old lawyer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protected girl he loved
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but they could not have proven a gas against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably a mere bluff
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was soft hearted and impetuous said beth and being in love he didn't stop to count the cost
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if the prosecution word withdrawn and the gee settled with the victim of the forged check then the younger man would be allowed his freedom
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but under the circumstances i doubt of such an arrangement could be made
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fair views twelve miles away for by ten o'clock they drew up at the county trail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were received in the little office by a manly markham who was the jailer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we wish to talk with him answered kenneth talk
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm running for representative on the republican ticket said kenneth quietly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'll say that's different observed marken altering his demeanor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: may we see date at once asked kenneth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they followed the jailer along the succession of passages
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sometimes on that yearn than for a smoke a merely crazy ion know which is worse died one way or feather
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he unlocked the door and called here is visitor's tom
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: worse tom horse an error replied the choler clue
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mis de graf said kenneth noticing the boy's face critically as he stood were the light from the passage fell upon it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sorr we have an any reception room in the jail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sit down please said gates and a cheerful pleasant voice there's a pens yer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a threshold some looking boy with tom gates was steady gray eyes have intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have heard something of your story said kenned and are interested in it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i didn't stop to think whether it was foolish y're not i did it and i'm glad i did it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: old well as a fine fellow but poor and helpless since missus rogers h her accident
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then rots wouldn't do anything but lead her around and wait upon her and the place went to rack and ruin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he spoke simply but paced up and down to nero cell in frown of them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: whose name det you signed to the check asked kenneth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concert
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it's a stop company in rich
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was big keeper so it was easy to get a blink check and forge the signature
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved to him a heavy loss one day
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the the plant the martial never even thanked me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm going to see mister marshall said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thank you sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it won't be much but ungrateful su find a friend
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they left him then for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'll seem lals to that kind in my day
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and it ruins man's disposition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he looked up rather a gracious weep but motioned them to be seated
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some girls b in here twice to interview london and i have refused to admit her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'm not electioneering just now
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh well sir what about him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and he deserves su term in states prison
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'll pay all the cause besides
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: your foolish why should you do all this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i have my own reasons mister martial
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: give me a check for the earn fifty and i'll turn over to you the forge check and clash further proceedings
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he detested the grasping dis vicious him that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gates
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: beth uneasy yet as silence munched him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he might have had that forged check for the face of it if he'd been sharp
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundreds and fifty dollars
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so to the surprise at the democratic committee and all his friends mister hopton d's announced that he would oppose forts aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one of sister hoped in's first tasks after calling his faithful henchman around him was to make a careful countess of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the weak need contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from opposition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the democratic committee figured out away to do this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: under ordinary conditions reynolds was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to like hopkins
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the only thing necessary was to fix seth reynolds and this hopton arranged personally
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and this was why kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the description she gave of the coming reception to the women's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle work
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist an electing mister forbes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the fair view band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: tables were spread on the lawn and the dainty but substantial repast was to be served
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given an elmhurst and the only when within the memory of man where the neighbours and country people had been the invited guess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the attendants was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted for seeing great successes for their fight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we ought to have more attent tans beth said louise approaching her cousin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: won't you run into the house and see if martha can't spare one or two more maids
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when aunt jane was their mistress here and beth was her a special favourite
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the housekeeper led the way and beth followed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for a moment bestest stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and of slight smile upon her beautiful face
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at elmhurst a playing black gown with a white apron and cap
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then she gave the little laugh and replied no miss beth i elizabeth parson's
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but it can't be protested the girl
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i attend to a household bending you know and care for the linen
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you speak like an educated person said beth wonderingly where's your home
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for the first time the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rocked slowly back and forth i'm sorry said beth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: elsa parson's shook her head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they they excite me in some way and i i can't bear them you must excuse me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: bath was a beautiful girl the handsom of the three cousins by far yet eliza surpassed herr in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her mater was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well bread composure and calm reliance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her eyes wandered to the maid's hands
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: however her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i b wish i knew myself she cried fiercely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will you leave be alone in my own room or must i go away to escape you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: eliza closed the door behind her with a decided swam and the key clicked in the lock
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: concord returned to its place amidst the tents
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: english fated to the french baskets of flowers of which they had made a pliable provision to gree be arrival of the young princesses the french in return invited the english to a supper which was to be given the next day
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: congratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the respect pain her on all sides she seemed like a queen and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three she appeared in object of worship the queen mother gave the french the most affectionate reception france was her native country and she had suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget friends
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she taught her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had both been hospitably received and where a brilliant future opened for them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the count had thrown himself back on his seat leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remain thus his face buried in his hands with ching chest and restless limbs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this has indeed been a harassing day continued the young man his eyes fixed upon his friend
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will be frank with me away
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: can you imagine my buckingham has been so violent i suspect
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is you wem must taken row i have read his distressing his eyes in his every gesture and action the whole day
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can perceive love clearly enough
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am convinced of what i say said the count
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is annoyed then
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in those very terms i even had more
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but continued row not interrupted by this movement of his friend heaven be praised the french who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet reckless kept him are capable of bringing a calm and sound get ment to bar own matters of such high importance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thus it is that the honor of furious saint our country are masters and our own
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes i mean repose many things i agitated me today both in mine and body when you returned to morrow i shall no longer be the sitting man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in this friendly pressure row could detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the night was clear starlit and splendid the tempest had passed a wish and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life peace and security everywhere
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: upon the large square in front of the hotel the shadows of the tents intersected by the golden moonbeams formed as it were a huge mosaic of jet in yellow flagstones
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: bright on washed for some time the conduct of the two lovers listened to the loud and unseal slumbers of manicamp who snored as impiously as though he was wearing his booming gold instead of his violet suit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the lath makes another discovery
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were subtly no near the solution of their problem
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the poor little things cried sin thea think of them having been turned to the wall all d ears
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now what is the sense of it pinus if babies like that
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but jee had not been listening all at once she put on her candle on the table and faced her companion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the twin brother did something she did' like and she turned his picture to the wall
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hers happened to be on the same frame too but she evidently didn't care about it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now what have you to say said this brag
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i thought we were stumped again when i first saw that picture but it of some us after alla
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do youse suppose the mature was a copy of the same thing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what of the world do it clearly choice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were any terribly am besides i like to see what this lovely furniture looks like without such quantities of dust all over it they it scheme sin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will come and hear this afternoon with old clothes on and happen regular hows clinging
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it can't hurt anything i'm sure for we won't disturb things at all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this thought however did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: smugly in the house cleaning paraphernalia into the cellar window unobserved that afternoon proved no easy task for scythia had added a wis broom and dust pan to the outfit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: v lure proved too much form an he came sporting after a asked frisky as a young kitten much to sins delight when she caught sight of him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh let him come long she urged i de love to see him about be old house
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he makes it sort of poser
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now lets does the furniture and pictures
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yet little as it was it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: surface dus at least have been relieved and the fine old furniture dave the hint of its real elegance c polish
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then she suddenly remarked
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and my pocket poney is kep low again and you have it any left as usual
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they say illumination by candlelight as the purchase in the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why it's g mi ith as usual that both cried peering and
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as that he the greatest r became to odd corners
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: forgetting all their wearin us they see their candles and sturbed int the house finding on occasional paper tucked away in some odd torn her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well unconvinced that the forted up house mystery happened not earlier than april sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probably not much later
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no words were spoken no language was uttered save that of wailing in hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and not in reality
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i heard a noise behind i turned and saw kaffer his black eyes shining wile in his hand held a gleaming knife he lifted above his head as if to strike but a had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: onward set a distant voice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no sound broke the stillness of the night
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the story of its evil influence came back to me and he my bewildered condition i wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what was that
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one then a human hand large and shapely appear distinctly on the surface of the pointed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nothing more not even the wist to which it might be attached
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it did not beckon or indeed move at all it was as still as the hand of death
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i awoke to consciousness fighting at first had seemed as if i was fighting with the phantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was kaffer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a sound of voices a flash of light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a feeling of freedom and i was awake where
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: said another voice which i recognize o full chose kaffer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had scarcely known while i had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke i looked at my hand
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the light of the moon i saw on knife red with blood and my hand too was also discoloured
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i do not know i am dazed bewildered
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but that is caffs life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know he had it this very evening
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: our river saying have we been together
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ole chair picked up something from the ground and looked at it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i say you do know what this means and you must tell us
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a terrible fought lashed into my mind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i had again been acting under the influence of this man's power
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: perchance too calf's death might serve him in good stead
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my tongue refused articulately my power of speech left me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my position was too terrible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my over mought you held to that last
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for some time after that i remembered nothing distinctly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the three modes of management
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by reason an affection
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as the chase drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the doorstep her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatreds of the doctor distrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexation an ill humor surge and swell among those delegate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps and irreparable injury
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the mother as soon as the chase is so far turned that mary can no longer watch the expression of her confidence goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfaction on her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so you will be a good girl i know' not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the mother im managing the case in this way realise partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appealed to her affection
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if you should not be a good girl what should show sides of making us any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but this lasts supposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been habitually managed on mis principle she will not make any trouble
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection cannot be overrated
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: della had a young sister named maria and a cousin whose name was jane
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now gallia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to give an idea of these conversations i will report one of them in f

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for instance one day the children had been plain upon the piazza with blocks and other playthings and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were now plain with their dolls in the parlor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: delia came to the parlor and with an air of great mystery that caned the children aside and said to them in a whisper leave angela and rosalie here and don't say awd to them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the room and round by a circuitous rout to the piazza there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: said she pointing the playthings see
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: puts these plea things all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know anything about your leaving them out
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nature of the effect produced by early impressions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that is comparatively nothing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we not going to any such extreme as this we can easily see on reflection how vast in influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of actions immature years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impressed upon the mind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but ands cared nothing about that
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he made bout so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dum found it i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but ands
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was such a big boy that he were high boots and carried a jack knife
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now this knife was a splendid one though half the blab was gone and the handle was a little cracked an ands knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes why not thought ands
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: seeing that i am so five i may as well go and do it the king
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i am going to the court ball answered ands
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and she took and her's hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every third step and through the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing wherever he went
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: f like as not they must have thought him a prince when they saw is fine cap
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled and glittering decanters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the princess sent down under a blue canopy with bouquets a roses and she let and her sit in a golden chair by her side

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he only shook his head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well but now said the princess and she filled his pocket with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his necks and bent down and kissed him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that is a very fine capt you have he said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so it is said ands
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and it is made of mother's best yarn and she knitted it herself and everybody wants to get it away from me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with one jump ands got out of his chair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he darted lake an arrow threw all the halls down all the stairs and across the yards
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cat for a king's golden crown he said that ands was a stupid
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and her's face grew red
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but his mother hug been close
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no my little son she said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five o'clock the king entered his cabinet for his tailors or awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ah very well
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: let him come in then said the king and as if colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself a kant with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two courtiers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: gentlemen do your posts whereupon saint annon in viler right took their leave
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: certainly sire but i must have money to do that what
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what do you meane inquired louise
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he has given them with too much grace not to have utter still to give if they are required which as the case at the present moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: does your majesty then no longer believe the disloyal attent
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not at all you are on the contrary most agreeable to me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: your majesty's plan then in this affair is
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will take them from my private treasure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the news circulated with the rapidity of lightning during its progress it kindled every variety of coquetry desire and wild ambition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the kan had completed his toilet f nine o'clock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dais or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theatre of wonderful elegance of construction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: suddenly for the purpose of restoring piece in order spring accompanied by his hall court made his appearance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the seasons allies of spring followed him closely to form a quadroon which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the dance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage in flesh coloured silken hose a silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seemed to soar along
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes it is suppressed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: far from it sire your majesty having given no directions about it the musicians have retained it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes sire and ready dressed for the valley
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sire he said your majesty's most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he is already shown on the field of battle
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the king seemed only pleased with everyone present
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the valley began the effect was more than beautiful
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutored pantomime of that period only the more natural on account of the variant different acting of the august actors had reached its culminating point of triumph the theatre shook with tumultuous applause
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgment he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked preference of the princess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupified
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the king who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quad cast a luck upon his vanquished rival
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: everyone could observe his agitation and prostration a prostration which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and his eyes with all their bright intelligence be dimmed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: upon this madame dean to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte observing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do you think so she replied with indifference
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: explain yourself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i allude to the goddess
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the princess inquired no
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theater but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love as thus strangely constituted he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from their presence of one who had broken his heart
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: remaining i implore you the evening is most lovely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in deed pap
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i remember now and i congratulate myself do you love anyone

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how is it laval said mademoiselle d tunic sh and that the vicomte bragg alone spoke of you as louise

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i give my consent
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh i am speaking seriously replied montalais and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the kings i suppose is it not louise
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: let us run then set all three and gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thickest cupboard of the park
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in fact the sound of madam and a queen's carriages could be heard in the distance upon the hard dry ground of the roads followed by the mountain cavaliers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this way the fet of the whole court was a fet also for the mysterious inhabitants of the forest for certainly the deer in the break the pheasant on the branch the fox in its whole were all listening
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: all about him was a tumult of bright and broken color scattered in broads splashes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the merganser had a crested head of iridescent green black a broad collar of lustrous white black back black and white wings white belly sides finely penciled and blacken whit and a breast of rich chestnut red streaked with black
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his feet were read his long narrow beak with its saul toothed edges and sharp hooked tip was bright red
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls hawks and eagles he had no rending falls
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but suddenly straight and swift as a diving cric he shot down her the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: once fairly a winging however he wheeled and made back hurriedly for his perch
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and m have seem that a trout of this size was a fairly substantial meal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but such was his keenness that even while the wide fuchs of his endured to victim were still sticking out of the corns of his beak his fierce red eyes of were once more appearing downward ino the torrent in search of fresh prey
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in despair he hurled himself downward too soon
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the great hawk fouled hurriedly to retrieve his prey from the ground
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the cat growled softly picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted ino the bushes to devour it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in fact he had just finished it the last of the trout's tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strained gullet when the baffled hawk caught sight of him and swooped
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if surprised
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: like his unfortunate little cousin the teel he too had felt the fear of deaths smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge to some dark overhanging bank deep fringe with weeds where the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hawks sat upon the branch and watched his quarries swimming beneath the surface
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: almost instantly you as forced to the top
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but of this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but this frequent of the heights of air for all his savage valor was troubled at the leaping waves in the tossing foam of these mad rapids he did not understand them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as he flewed his down reaching clutching talents were not half a yards ab the fugitive head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where the wayes for an instant sank they came closer but not quite within grasping reach
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but as before the leaping waves at the rapids were too much for his pursuer and you able to flap his way onward in and a clouds of foam o doom hung low above his head yet hesitated to strike
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged and pursuit as a weasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he had a lot of line out and the place was none too free for a long cast but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was speeding
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the last drop fly as luck with habit caught just in the corner of the hawks angrily open beak hooking itself firmly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the sudden sharp sting of it the great bird turned his head and noticed for the first time the fisherman standing on the bank
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the dragged upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then the leader parted from the line
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he is a welcome figure at the garden parties of the elect who were always ready to encourage him by accepting free seats for his play actor managers nod to him ed ears allow him to contribute without charge to his impose yum on the price of golf falls
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his short he becomes a prominent figure inland of society and if he is not careful somebody will say so
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you were plain must be not merely a good play but a successful one
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: frankly i cannot always say
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but suppose you said i'm fond of writing my people always say my letters home or good enough for punch

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: indeed he resolution mean the ken out of hamlets soliloquy a clever player could to some extent indicate be whole thirty lines by a silent working of the jaw but at the same time it would be idle to deny that he would miss the finer shades of the dramatist meaning
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we moderns however see the absurdity of it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if it be granted first that the thoughts of a certain character should be known to the audience and secondly that soliloquy or the habit of thinking aloud is in opposition to modern stage tape pee how shall a solo gree be avoided without damage to the play
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and so one till you get the end when o neil might say ah yes or something non committal of that sort
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this would being easy way of dinging it but it would not be the best way for the reason that it is too easy to call a kitchen to itself
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the old badly made play it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: an the modern well constructed play he simply rings up an imaginary confederate and tells in what he is going to do could anything being more natural

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: while former foretold that the scottish covenanters were secretly forming a union with the english parliament and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking the latter still insisted that every such attempt would precipitate them into measures to which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the king's ears were now open to mon trot's councils who propos'd none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cours and
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: five hundred men more who had been levied by the coon enters were persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combined force he hastened to attack lord alco who lay at perth with an army of sixth thousand men assembled upon the first ms of the irish invasion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: dreading the superior power of argyle who having joined his vessels to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerable army montrose hastened northward in order to rouse again the marquis of hooty and the gordons who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the covenanters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this nobleman's character though celebrated for political courage and conduct was very low for military prowess and after some skirmishes in which he was worsted he here allowed montrose to escape him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by quick marches through these inaccessible mountains that general freed himself from this superior forces of the covenanters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with these and some reinforcements of the ethel men and mc dons whom he had recalled montrose fell suddenly upon ar giles country and let loose upon it all the rage of war carrying off the cattle burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this severity by which montrose sullied his victories was the results of private animosity against the chieftain as much as of zeal for the publick cause agile collecting three thousand men marched in questioned the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at inner locking supposing himself still at a considerable distance from them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by a quick and unexpected march m chose hastened to inner locke and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised but not a frightened covenants
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his conducts and presence of mind in this emergence appeared conspicuous
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: montrose weak in cavalry here lining his troops of horse with infantry and after putting the enemy's horse to route fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cut in pieces th with the loss of the gallant lord gordon on the part of the royalists
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the same men new regiments and new companies were formed different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands as the independence could rely on
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: besides members of parliament who were excluded many officers unwilling to serve under the new generals threw up their commissions and unwarily facilitated the projects of putting the army entirely into the hands of that faction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: though the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible a more exact plan was introduced and rigorously executed by these new commanders
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: valor indeed was very generally diffused over the one party as well as the other during this period discipline also was attained by the forces of the parliament but the perfection of the military art in concerting the general plans of action and the operations of the field scenes still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: historians at least perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience have not remarked anything but a headlong impetuous conducts each party hurrying to a battle were valor unfortunate chiefly determine the success
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he passed through henley see albans and came so near london as harrow on the hill
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the scottish generals and commissioner as affected great surprise on the appearance of the king and though they paid him all the exterior respect due to his dignity they instantly set a guard upon him under colour of protection and made him in reality a prisoner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they informed the english parliament of this unexpected incident and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: or hath he given uses any gift
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the men of israel answered the men of judah and said we have ten parts in the king and we have also more right in david than yee why then did get despise oss that our our advice should not be first had in bringing back ours king
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: another preacher after reproaching him to his face with his misgovernment ordered this sum to be sung
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the king stood up and cold for that sum which begins with these words
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: have mercy lord on me i pray for men with ne devour
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the good natured audience in pity to fall in majesty show for once greater deference to the king thane to the minister than sung the sum which the former had called for
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the parliament than the scots laid their proposals before the king
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: before the settlement of terms the administration must be possessed entirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms and how incompatible that scheme with the liberty of the king is easily imagined
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the english it is evident had they not be previously assured of receiving the king would never have parted with so considerable of some and while they weakened themselves by the same measure have strength and the people with whom they must afterwards have so material an interests to discuss
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if any still retain rancor against him in his present condition they passed in silence while his well wishers more generous than prudent accompanied his march with tears were acclamations and with prayers for his safety
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his death in this conjecture was a public misfortune
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult parts of our whole enterprise
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bringing up habitual associates images in expectations of their usual correlates all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that i do approximately represent impressions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and what sort of evidence is logically possible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with the population that remembered wholly unreal past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: all that i am doing is to use its logical ten nobility as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the behaviourist who attempts to make psychology a record of behavior has to trust his memory in making the record
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist fills confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but i do not think such an inference is warranted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: ours confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yett we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a france face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some images like some sensations fill very familiar while others fill strange
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: familiarity is a filling capable of degrees
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in an image of a well known face for example some parts may fill more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the flinging of greater or less remoteness in some remembered events
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of past ness especially where immediate memory is concerned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relations to the present but it is clear that such fillings must play an essential part in the process of dating remember events
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if we had retained the subjects or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this case as in most others what may be taken a certain in advance is rather v
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the first of our vague that indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we might provisionally that perhaps not quite correctly defined memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in ours knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediately
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a gramophone by the health of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from grandi phones as they like to believe
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can set to workin now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the fact that a man can recite a poems does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: simmons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they give laws according to which images of past occurrence is come into our minds but do not discuss ours belief that these images refer to pas occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is this that is a interests to theory of knowledge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is by no means always reliable almost everybody hash at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at som time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it lees us to search the environment until we are satisfy that we have found the appropriate objects which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the fling a familiarity alone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a further stage is recognition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more that a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first since and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to again with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the definition of my experience is difficulty broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain lynx of which the various forms of memory a among the most important
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thus if i recognize the thing the occasion of its previous existence and virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is single doubt from the rest of the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter and another light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: had eager cress weller not been good looking had jack and still ac college had sir kennington oval remained in england i mister bennet and the barkeeper not succeeded and stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in a ri for the final departure of my old friend
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on arriving at home at my own residence i found that ar slang was filled with a brilliant company
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mode of address that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i have come to your sure as mister president with the purpose of seeing how things of progressing in this disan quarter of the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have our little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rose water
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we are quite satisfied now captain battle ax said my wife
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: quite satisfied said eva
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the ladies and compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic are on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed are on the other
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no doubt in process of time the ladies will follow
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: their master said missus never be
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i did not mean said captain battle ax the touch of upon public subjects at such a moment as this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: missus never been you must indeed be proud of your son
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: jack had been standing in the four corner of the room talking to eva and was now reduced the silence by his praises
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sir kennington oval is a very fine player said my wife
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i and my wife and sun and the two press wells and three or four others agreed to din on b the ship on the next
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this i felt was paid to me as being president other republic and i endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might be fit the occasion but i could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my wife on the spur the moment managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with their
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh yes said jack and i'm nowhere
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but i mean to have my innings before long
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of what missus never been had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her tasks with thorough success
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then went ashore
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how much of evil a real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me during the last few days
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: walk ii do now but just lame myself down and die
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the death of which i dreamt could not alas
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when this captains should have taken himself and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farms which i possessed at the furthers side of the island and there in seclusion what i end my days
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: jack would become even happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: think i of all this i went to sleep
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister never bend began the captain and i observe that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president it cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character in england stands so high
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is a duty said i
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but your power is so superior to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not a doubt but had your force been only double or trouble our own i should have found it my duty to struggle with you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that is all quite true mister never then said sir ferdinand do brown
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can afford to smile because i am absolutely perilous before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have been on board
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then said sir fernando there is nothing for it but that we must take you with him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you hear what sir ferdinand o browne i s replied cap the battle ax
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but what is de delicate mission i asked
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage and mattered not which
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then the republick of britannula was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be a resulted and a british governor installed in the executive chambers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you may be quite short its there said captain battle ax and that i can so use it asked to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you propose a kid not me i said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what will become of your gun where i to kid not be you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: lieutenant cross trees is a very gallant officer
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one of us always remains on boards while the others u sure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crusts them both on my words had it been possible my dislike centered itself on sir ferdinand
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will allow me to suggested he but that is a matter of opinion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where i to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the letter ran as follows
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sir i have an in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crowned colony which is called britannula
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the procured there circumstances of the colony are within your excellencies knowledge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but in their selection of a constitution the briton ells have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has wrung their present difficulties
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but it is surmise that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your govern
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the john break his arm with a weapon of great power against which it is impossible that the people of britain ellis should prevail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you will carry out with you one hundred men of the north northwest birmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own sturdy as it is thought that if mister never been be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits the obedience
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when do you intend that the john bright shust starr
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: to day i shouted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the ar hies of the government
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i shall be happy to take charge of them said sir fernando
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they of course must all be author
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: your power is sufficient i said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if you will give us your promise to meet kept them add ox here at this time to morrow we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the john bright for twenty four hours
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and this plan was adopted too in order to extract for me a promise that i would depart in peace
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this was what to did the mischief so far as the running away was concerned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is hardly necessary to say more of them here
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the manner in which he expressed himself with regarded to robert holland no man in the whole range of his recollections will be longer remembered than he his enthrone ment while under holland will hardly ever be forgotten
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of this party edwards a boy of seventeen call for worth much sympathy he too was claimed by holland
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: john wesley combat jacob tailor and thomas edward skinner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a fewe years back one of their slaves a coachman was kept on the coach box one cold night when they were out at a ball until he became almost frozen to death in fact he did die in the infirmary from the effects of the frost about one week afterwards
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the doctor who attended the injured creature in this case was simply told that she slipped and filed down the stairs as she was coming down
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: another case said john wesley was a little girl half grown who was washing windows up stairs one day and unluckily fell asleep in the window and in this position was found by her mistress in a rage that mistress hid her a heavy slap knocked her out of the window and she fail to the pavement and died in a fewe hours from the effects thereof
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as shes rolled nothing was done in the way of punishment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i never knew love but one man who could ever please him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he worked me very hoard he wanted to be beating me all the time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she was a large homely woman they were common white people with no reputation in the community
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: substantially this was jacob's unvarnished description of his master and mistress
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as to his age and also the name of his master jacobs statement varied somewhat from the advertisement
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of starting i didn't know the way to come
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: its almost beyond conjecture
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this reality begins to explain the dark power and other worldly fascination of twenty thousand leagues under the seas
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: first as a paris thought broker later as a celebrated author and yachtsmen he went on frequent forages to britain america' the mediterranean
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nemo built a fabulous futurists submarine m nautilus than conducts in underwater campaign of fantoms against his imperialist oppressor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in all the novel head a difficulty just in
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: others subtleties occurred inside each episode the textures sparkling with wit information and in sight
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his specifications for an open sea submarine at a self containing diving suit were decades before their time yet modern technology vs them m triumphantly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: even the supporting cast it shrewdly drawn professor aronnax the career scientists caught in an ethical conflict corse the compulsive classifier who supplies humorous tag lines for verne fast facts the harpooner ned land a creature of constant appetites man as heroic animal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but much if the novels brooding power comes from captain nemo
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this compulsion leads nemo into ugly contradictions he a fighter for freedom yet all who bore his ship or imprisoned there for good he works to save lives of human and animal yet he himself creates a hall cost he detests imperialism yet he lays personal claim to the south pull
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and in this last action he falls into the classic sin of pride
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hes swiftly punished
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the nautilus nearly perishes in the antarctic and nemo sinks into a growing depression
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for many then this book has been a source of fascination surely one of the most influential novels ever written and inspiration for such scientists and discoverers as engineer simon lake ocean dat refer william b b polar traveler or earnest shackleton
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: fathom six feet
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: graham roughly one twenty eighth of an ounce
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: milo gram roughly one twenty eight thousand of an ounce
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: leader roughly one court
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: meter roughly one yards three inches
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: millimeter roughly one twenty fifths of an inch
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: chapter three as master wishes
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: three seconds before the arrival of j b hobson's letter i know more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the northwest passage
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: even so i had just returned from an arduous journey exhausted and badly needing arst
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wanted nothing more than to see ab country again of friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved collections
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but now nothing could hold me backs
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: conseil was my man's servant
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the botanical gardens the boy had come to know a thing or two
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: classifying was everything to him so he do nothing else well ver so in a theory of classifications he was poorly first in its practical application and a doubt that he could tell us sperm wale from a blin wale
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and yet what a fine gallanted lad
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of the journey
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: never did he object to buckling up his suit case for any country whatever china or the congo no matter how far off it was
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he went here there and everywhere in perfect contentment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: place forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting that i had turned forty
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was a fanatic on formality and he only addressed me in the third person to the point wor at gat has him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was good reason to stop and think even for the world's most emotionless man
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cosey i called a third tim co appeared
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: dead masters summon me he said entering
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: pack as much into my trunk as you can my traveling kit my suits shirts and socks don't bother counting just squeeze it all in and hurry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will gal with them later what
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: anyhow will leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to france
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes we are certainly i replied evasively but after we make ad tour
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a rout slightly less direct that's all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: relieving on the abraham lincoln
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you see my friend it's issue of the monster the notorious normal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we not know wherein will take us
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but we're going just the same
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have a commander whose game for anything
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to paris france
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the barbarossa and conseil at my heels i jumped into a carriage
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate i rushed aboard
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i asked for commander fer witch
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one of the sailors led me to the after deck where i stood in the presence of a smart looking officer who extended his hand to me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in person welcome aboard professor your cabin is waiting for you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officers mass
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: will be quite comfortable here i toll conseil
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and so if i had been delayed by a quarters of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some scepticism
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wharves of brooklyn and every part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: departing from five hundred thousand throats three cheers burst forth in succession
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hailing the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new yorks city
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then you roche downstairs into the courtyards shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening took catch everybody in his dominions at the sailorman was not recapture
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hold him fast my in and as soon as i had my coffee inn l i'll take him to the room of the great knife and patch him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i wouldn't mind a couple coffee myself said come boo i'd have had considable exerts eis this morin in an i'm or any for breakfasts
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the cap'n bill made no such attempt knowing it would be useless
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boolooroo get a yellow disappointment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the room of the great knife was high and big and a round it ran rose of dines for the spectators the sit upon
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in one place at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant throne chairs for the king and queen and sixth smaller but richly upholstered chairs for the snubs princesses
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: therefore her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as the were haughty and overbearing
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: morning girl so pie feal as well is you look
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: control yourselves and my dears replied the boolooroo the worse punishment i know how toy inflict on anyone this prison is b to suffer you will see a very pretty patching my royal daughters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: suppose its of bring
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the captain shook his head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: why you sick to fetch the firs living creature we met and that was the spirit bote replied the captain panting hard as he held fast to one of the goat's h horns
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the idea of patching cap'n bill to a goat was a vastly amusing to him and a more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter
