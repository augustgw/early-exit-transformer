for or five of the latter only ling it about the door of the prisoner of uncas weary but close observers of the manner of their captive
delivered in a strong tone of assent announced the gratification the savage would receive and witnessing such an exhibition of weakness and an enemy so long hated and so much feared
they drew back a little from the entrance and motion to the supposed conjure to enter
but the bare instead of o being maintained to the seat it had taken and growled
the cunning man as afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage to continued david improving the hend he received they must stand further off
then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place
it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
on jest occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful with
the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
what shall we do with the ms at the door they counts six and the singer as as good as nothing
the delawares are children of the tortoise in the outstrip the deer
uncas who had already approached the door and readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
but hack ey who is too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself into his companion
so uncas he had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speeded
well what can't be done by main encourage and war must be done by circumvention
as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him in his parting instructions
my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy in love returned day that a little n held that so direct and attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have never forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
if you are not then knocked on the head your being an u composer will protect you and you'll then have a good reason to expect toed die in your bed
said choose for yourself to make a rush or tarry here
bravely en generously as he battled in my be half and this and more will i dare in his service
keep silent is longest made be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will served to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
if however they take your scalp as i trust in believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it is become true warriors and trusty friends
holds said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy an humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
then having a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practise myself as one without across a blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
godless you friend i do believe you sent as not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes th much depends on the natural gifts in the force of temptation
the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features is he afraid
will the hearns here his games
mole he can started on his feet and shook his a shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort
he had no occasioned to delay for the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air ran along the whole extent to the village
uncas cast akin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
i will endeavoring my statement to avoid such terms as would served to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrolled the agitation that it was clear something very unusual have had occurred
my friend's temper had not improved since he had been decried of the congenial surroundings of baker street
without his scrap looks his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
i had to rated over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
i was absent mother more than an hour
the only du poo it which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who is looked after my room for ten years and whose honestest is absolutely above suspicion
the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged him on my papers
the proof was in three longing slips i had left them altogether
d turned it was that someone passing had served the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in the chair will i made a most careful examination of the room
a broken tip of bed was lying there also
not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black go were clay with spects of something wish looked track sa us at
above all things by desire to settled matter quietly and discreetly
too the bast at my belief they were rolled up
did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
i was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door open
so its seems to me
now mister stones at your sposa
above were three students one each story
that he approached it and standing on tipt it his that craned he looked into the room
there is no opening except the one paying said our learned guide
i am afraid there' no signs here said he
one could hardly hope for any upon so dy day
you left him an a chair your say which chair by the window there
the man entered and took the papers she by sheet from the central table
as a matter of fac he could not said alms for i entered by the side door
h long would to taken to do that using every possible contraction a quarter an an hour not less
then he tossed it down and seized the next
he was in the minster of that when your return caused him to make a vari hurried retreat very hurried since he had not times to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
mister som was someone overwhelmed by this fled of information
calms how out a small ship with the letters and e and the space of clear wood after them u see
watson ive have always done you an injustice there are others
i was hoping that if the paper which he wrote was thin some trace it it might come through upon his polish surface no i see nothing
as homes through the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and in alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
hm starn away and stooped to suddenly to the floor how what is this
hommes have it out on his open palm in the glare of the elector light
what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into a bedroom to conceal himself
i understand you to say that there are three stood int to use this stair and are on the habit of passing your door yes there are
and they are all in for the examinations yes
one hardly lees of tho suspicion whet are no proofs
let us see a suspicions i will look after the proofs
my skill i has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
the top floor belongs tor moles thecla and
i dare not goes su far as that but of the three he has perhaps the least unlikely
he was still suffering from the sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his lifely
by have occasionally d the same thing at other times
did you look at these papers on the table
how came you to leave the key in the door
anyone the room could get out yes sir
i really don't think hee much bowed at mister homes
only for a minute or so
oh i would not ventured to say sir
you haven't seen any of them no sir
it was the indian who stark soil wat appeared suddenly upon his blind
he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
the set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it do is not unusual for visitors to go over them
no names please said homes as we knocked to go cry door
of course he did not realize that it was eye who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances runs suspicious
th is very importance in homes
you don't seem to realizing a position
to morrow was the examination
i canoun allowed examination to be held if one of the papers been tampered with the situation must be faced
it is possible that i may be an a position then to indicate some course of action
i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings good by
when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
the fou mouse fellow at the top
he is the one with the worst record
why basest a servant what's his game in the matter
he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man
my friend did not appeared to be depressed by his failure re shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation
no good my dear watson
i think so you have form a conclusion
yes my dear watson i have solve the mystery
look at that he held of out his hand
on the palm was threes little pyramids of black di clay
and one more this morning
in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the de loma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to computed for the valuables cols him it
he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched think heaven that he have come up
you know him i think so
if this matter is not to be come publicly must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court marshal
nod sir certainly not
there was no man sir
his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon banister in the farther corner
just close the door said homes
we want to know mister gil christ how you and honorable man ever came to commits such in an action is that yesterday
far a moment grist with upraised hand tried to control his wiving features
come come said hommes kindly it is human to air and at least no one can ac's you of being a callus criminal
well well don't table of to answer listen and see that i do you know injustice
he could examined the papers in his own office
the indian i also fought nothing of
when i approached too room i examined the window
no one less than that would have a chance
i entered and i took you into my confidence as to this suggestions of the side table
he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as aware with several sharp spikes
no harm would have been done had had not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
he putt his shoes on the table
gloves said the young man
suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
have i told the truth mister deil christ
i had a letter here mister sums which i wrote to you early this morning in an the love restless night
it will be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have leet this young man out since she were left in the room and must have locked the door when you w out

the honorable child smith ms sara's brother was walking swiftly up town from mister easter les walled office and his face was pale
at last the cotton combine was to all appearances in assured fact and he was slated for the sinnate

she was not herself un notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence and others

the revelation of his love lighted and righting slowly to it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder
he panted to know if she too knew for knew and cared not for cared and knew not
she was so strange in whom but a creature

he splashed to staff a along farther and farther onwards until he near the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge

everything he has done has been aim that the conservation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
for churn years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously
it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could a charge to lag batteries all of which are easily with am ability of the dire curate

he soon fore saw that still greater economy would be necessary f commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact district of large cities
the strong position held by thetis in system under the strenuous composition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and he gave an immediate impetus to in can descent lighting
it was specially suited for a trial plat also in the early days when a yielded six or eight laps to the horse power was consider subject for congratulation
the street conductors were of the overhead whole lined construction aw installed by the construction cop e that had been organized by addison to build an equipped central stations

there was infinite scepticism a rounding on the subject and while other invents were also giving the subject barefoot the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or way and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact pined use could not be brought to accurate registration

the principle employed in the absent electric mitre is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to dee compose a chemical substance
associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
the standard abed meter practice was to remove the selves once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another set being substituted

in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the attent meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in station sewing current by metre
the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the clots of the century
he waved and re way the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
he felt he was up against an and it perhaps in anther kind of a job would suit him better

mary sighed
a bis wind had come up and was driving pub white clouds across the sky
the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
that invitation decided her

in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pale and he began to swinging his si with that long even stroke that view american boys ever learn
mar picked cherries and saying softly to herself stripping one glittering ranch after her another shivering when she caught a shower of rain drop up her neck and hair
an ami knowe his way slowly down toward the jerry trees
that summer the reins had been so many and opportune that it was almost mor than cha arta and has man could do the few up with the corse the orchard was an neglected wilderness
i don't know all of them but i know b and are
if i feel that way i feeld that way
he reached out up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit long ivory coloured barrys tipped with main pink like white coil that falter the ground unheeded all summer threw
he dropped a handful into her l
yes don't you

when she used to count me about him but always wondered whether she wasn't her little anden love with him
it would serve you all right if she walked off with carle

lars face fall under his brooding gab
i'm sure out at sand your hope you he will stay on here she murmured
i don't not s stand around to look
i want to be doing something on my own account
sometimes i don't wants to do anything at all and sometimes i went to pull the four corners of the divide together he thar out his arm and brought it back with a jerk so like a tablecloth
i get tired of seeing man and horses going up them down up th down
i wish you want so rest us and didn't get so worked up over things she said sadly

i can't play with you like a little boy any more he s slowly that's t you m mary
but almo if i understand then all put times are over we can never do nice things together any more
and anyhow there's nothing to understand
that what last nicholl go away and things will be pas as they used too
i pray for you but that not the same as if you prayed yourself
i can't pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i walked pray not to have him not i damped for it
then our good gins far over
saturday august fifteenth the sea and brok in all round no land in sight
the horizon seems extremely distant
all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of it but now that i am well his nature has resumed it sway
you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye anxious
one might me would less reason the now
i am not playing the rate slow but that the seat is so wide
we arising time and facts i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon pond on a raft
he called the sea a pine and i long wah taking a little sail
therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects
i take this is my answer and i leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience
sunday august sixteenth
nothing knew whether unchanged the wind fishes
but there see no reason a fear
the shadow of the wat was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
truly the sea is of infinite wit
it must be as wide as the mediterranean or the atlantic and why might
these thoughts agitated me all day in my imaginations scarcely c down after several our sleeve
i shure as i recalled these monstrous to my remembrance
i sawed the hampered these the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in lag
i suppose professor leaden brock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examine the pick his eyes tra first ocean from side decide
tuesday august eighteenth
during his watch i sloped
two hours ab towards a terrible shock aw me
the raft was heed up on a wry mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms
there's a well a well cried the professor
fight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they wheeled around our little raft with the rapidity greater than that of expressed trades
two masters only regrating all this commotion and before my eyes are co reptiles of the primitive world
i con distinguish the eye of i thea source glowing like a reed hot co and his large as a man's head
its jaw is enormous and according the naturalist it arm would no less than il hundred and eighty two teeth
those huge creatures attack each other with a greatest animosity
suddenly at the as source and the pleas source disappear below leaving warp eddying in the water
as for the if the a sous has he returned her sub ring cavern
the warns become lost in the distance
the weather if we may use the terra will change before law
the atmosphere is charge with vapours proved with the at chit generated by the evaporation of sailing waters
the electric light conan scarcely penetrate to dance curtain which is dropped over the theatre on which the battle of the elements is ab to be waged
the air is heavy the sea is calm
from time to time a fleecy tuft of ms we yet some gleaming light left upon it crops down upon the dense flour grey and loses itself in the opake an a penetrable mass
the atmosphere as evidently charged and sarch tars with lick hey
the wind never lulls but to acquire increased strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge res far a fearful when guests and rushing storms
there is a head the storm coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon
those cloud seem as if they were going a quest the sea
on the mast already i see the light play of a lament sain awls fire the ostrich's sill catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lad
but if we have now ceased to advance why do we at leave that sail loose which it the first shock of a tempest m caps sis us in a moment
that will be to safest no no numb
the pow up vapors contents in the water and the air put in the violent action to supply the back him left by the commencing of the mist rouses itself into a world win
hon stairs night
from the under surface of the clouds their are continue missions of lud lie electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules the gashes elements of the air me to be slaked with most for in numa will columns of water rushed upwards into the air and fall back again in white fume
i referred to the the meter it indicates a figure isbanir
is the atmosphere condition having once reached the density to become final
the raft bears ar still to the south east
at noon the volts of the storm re doubles
each of us is lashed his some part of the raft
the waves rise above our heads
they seem to be we are lost but i'm not sure
he nods his consent
the far of ball half of it why half uz blue and the size and the ten in show moved so about the raft but revolving on its own axis with astonishing philos hey as if wh round by a force of the whirl winded
here comes there glides now it is up the ragged stump of the mast that's it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light down and just skins the powder magazine horrible
we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious slight nimbly leaps aside it approaches harms who fixes his blue eye upon it steadily it threatened the head of my uncle who falls upon its kneed with his head down to avoided
a suffocating smell of net gate fills the air it enters the throat it fills the lungs
we suffer stifling pains
and odd the directions who look
poor alice
it was the white rabid returning splendidly dressed with the pair wite kid goods in one hand and a large fan and the other he came trotting along in a great hurry mattering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess
oh what she be savage if i kept her waiting
i was tok the fan and gloves and as the hall was veryain hot she kept fann herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is day
and yesterday thanks went on just as usual
i wonder if i been changed in the light
i almost they i can remember feeling a little different
i'll try if i know all the things i used to know
i shall never did to twenty at that rate
how cheerfully he seems to grip how neatly spred his claws and welcome little fishes in would gently smiling jaws
no i'd made at my mind about it if im mabel i'll stay down here
it'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying call up a g e dear
i'm so very tired being all alone here
and i declare it's too b that it is
i wish hadn't cried so much said alice and she swim about trying to fin her way out
i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears
that will be a queer thing to be sure
i am very tied to swimming about here o mouse
cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
we won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not we indeedy
we wanted you to help us published some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american stream lie him c to speak because will never get people whether inn outside the luther and church actually to read luther and must we make con him talk as he would talk to day to americans
let us begin with that his commons hurls
the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed his a literary task proved the most difficult one and at times became oppressive
it was written and latin
the word had to be convinced
the wor should now be set about the origin of luthers common herr ails
much later when a friend of his was preparing in addition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine moles for instance
in other words these three men took down the lectures which li her addressed hiss and the course of galls and rara prepared the mana spirt for the printer
it presents like no other of luthers writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sentner for the sake of christ merits alone
but the essence of luther's lectures is there
the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do luke too
the word of our god shall stand forever
in every way they saw to under miny authority of saint paul
they said to the glens you have no right to thin high of paul
he was the last to turned christ
hacking waiter and is beneath us
indeed he persecuted the church of chris for a long time
do you suppose that god for the sake of a few ruther inherits would disown his entire church
against these boasting false a possums pall boldly defence his appel authority and ministry
as the am bass ere of o government is honored for hiss office and not for his private person so the minister of cries should exalt his office in order again authority among men
pul ties pride his ministry not to his own phase but to the praise of god
paul and apostle not of men it center
git of he call him ministers to the agency of men or he called them directly as he called the prophets in a puss
paw declares that the false a puss were crawler sent neither by men nor by man
the most they could claim is that there were sent by others
he mentions the a possums first because they were pointed directed by god
be call h not to be taken lightly
for person the possess knowledge is not enough
is spoils one's best works
but i was a young man i thought paul this making too much at of is call
i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
i know nothing of the doctrine faith because we were taught so fare instead a certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
this is no sinful pride it is holy prie
and got the father who raised him from the dead
the classing super vales on first sight
these perverts of the richness of christ resist the father and the sun and the works of them both
in this whole pestle pal treats of the resurrection of wise
by his resurrection chris one the victory over law sin flesh world double death hell and every evil
first two
and all the brethren which i with me
this she go far and shutting the mouth of the false of poses
although the bating with not a possesses like myself yet they are all of one mind with me think right and teach as i do
they do not go with the enemies of the gospel piny they go with the cushions are
why th not invaded the calf of provinces and preached their doctrine to gob miss princes bishops and doctors as we have them by the help of god
we looked for that reward which i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man
not all elation had become perverted it
these means cannot be contented in
they remained divine regardless and men's opinion
wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church' even though ant roused rings there
so much for the title of the a pistol now follows the greeting of the opossum verse three
grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
the terms of grace and piece are common terns with paul and are now prey well understood
the greeting of the a pots refreshing
grace involves the remission of sends peace and a happy conscience
the world brance this of permission doctrine
experience profess
however the grace in piece of god will
men should not speculate about the nature of gone
was it not enough to say from god the father
to do so as to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek a measure into comprehend his infinite majesty
he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes me fasten upon him
embrace and forget up the nature of god
did not christ himself say i am the way in the truth in the life no man come them to the father but by me
when you are you about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like
we are to hear christ to has been appointed by the father as our divine teachers
at the same time pal confirms our creek that christ is very god
that christ is very god is apparent in that pal ascribes him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to the spens grace and peace
to the stow piecing grace lies in the province of god who alone com created his blessings the angels cannot
otherwise paul should of written grace from go the father and pace from our lord jesus christ
the alliance took chris for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god treat of heaven and earth
mohammed also spile of christ
pic to theme
he never lose his side of the purpose of his a pestle
not goal over silver or passion lands or an angel but himselfe what four
not for crowned or kingdom were goodness before sins
under score these words for there are full of comfort for sore consciences
how m we obtained remission of or sins
pincers the man who is name jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for a since
since christ was given for our sons is stands to reason that they cannot be put away by own efforts
this sentence aoi finds our sins as great so great in fact that the whole worlds could not make amends for a singing son
the greatness of the ransom christ son of god indicates this
the vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for as sins
but wear careless we make light of sin
we think that by some little work a mer me caning dismiss
this passage then there iss out effect that all man or sold und sein
this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception this san is a small matter easily taken care of by good works but we must present our seals and to god with the good conscience that we must feel nose sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sense
this attitude is universal in and particular developed in those who consider themselves better of than others
but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
on the other hand we're not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair

they then renewed their journey and under the better light made a save crossing of the stable roofs
robin entered the hut dragging the unwilling quire after him
be not so foolish friend set fs tut costly
they moved thereafter cautiously about the hut groping before un about them to find something to show that warrant and it fulfilled his mission
they were upon the verge of an opened trap in the far corner of the hut and stately at tripped over the edge of the revers flap mouth of this pit
fs toot hand rested at last upon the top rung of a latter and slowly the truth came to him
robin carefully descended the latter and found himself soon upon firm rock grounded
studley was by his side in the flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape character of his vault
from the blackness behind light they heard a voice warrants

robin fits youth saw that at his doubts of warrant and had been unfair and he became ashamed himself for harbouring them
his tones rang pleasantly un warrant and' ears and forth with the good fellowship was heralded between them
the olds servant told him quietly as they crept back to gain well with this passageway led from the hut pleasant to sure wood and that jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaw in the forest
he import u to be discreet as the grave th this matter for en sooth his life in the hollow of our hands
they regain their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gan well
out in the wood stood a nice little fur tree
the place he had was a very avery good one the sun shown on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as furs
he did not think of the warms sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage childrens that ran about him prattled when they were in the woods looking for wilds strawberries
but this was what p tree could not bear to hear
in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hair would often come leaping along and jumped right over the little tree
that made him him so angry
to grow and gran to get old er and be tall thought the tree that after awe is the most of might for thing in the world
in autumn the wood cutters always came and fells of the largest trees
this happened every year and the young fir tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earths with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and bare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were lading carps and the horses dragged of them out of the wood
have you not neet them anyone
rejoys in thine growth said the sun beings
i then what happens then
i would fig know if i am destined for so glorious career cried the tree rejoicing
i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last yere oh
where i but own ready on the cart
where i in the m on room with all the splendour and magnificence
yes and something better something still grander will surely followed or wherefore should they thus ornament me
something better something still grander must follow but what
with joyce in our presents said the air and the sunlight
r choice in my own fresh youth
but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter and summer
and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
the ax struck deep into the veryain piffle the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pang there like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
he well you that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
with departure was not at all agreeable
the tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we out walked the others
there too were large easy chairs silken solos large tables full of picture books and full of toys where hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the childrens said so
the servants as well as as the young ladies decorated it
this evening they all said
how it will shine this evening
perhaps the other trees from the forest will con book at me
it blazed up famously hel help
cried the young ladies and m quickly put out the fire
a story
a story cried the children drawing a little fact a man towards the tree
but i shall tell only one story
humpy don't be fell down stirs and yet he married the princess
that's the way of the worlds
thought the fir tree and believe it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
i won't tremble to morrow thought the fir tree
and ha night the trees stood still and in deep thought
in the morning of the servants in the housemate came in
but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here at a dark corner wherein no daylight could enter they left him
whats the meaning of this thought the tree
and he leaned against the wall lost it revery
time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to puts some great trunks in the corner out of the way
is now winter out of doors thought the tree
how kind man is after all
if d only were not so dark here and so terribly lowly
sweet slick
they snuffed about the third tree and rustled amongst the branches
i am bind no means bold said the fir tee
there's maner one considerably older than i am
they were so extremely curious
i know no such place said the tree
and then he told all about his youths and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said
said the fir tree thinking over what he had himself related
yes in reality those more happy times
who hes upp don he asked the ms
ply that one answered the tree
it is a very stupids story
don't you know one of about bacon and cabo cans canst hotel and a loder stories
no said the tree
then garden by said the reaps and they went oh
at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree side after her all it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listened to what i told them
now that too iss over
why one morning that came quantity of people and set too work in the loft
the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shown
but it was not the third tree but b meant
it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
the golden star of tinsel was still on a top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
in the courtyard some of the married children were playing who had danced at christmas round the fir tree and were so glad at the sight of him
and the gardener's boy chopped which tree into small pieces there was a whole heat lying there
the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and it sides so deeply
however that was over now the tree gone the story have an end
dunnet them beat refrained from doling the other girls or uncle john of old will rodgers visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned who closely about the penalty for fortunate check
it was a serious cried indeed mister watson told them and t gates bade fair to serve length fe term in the states prison as a consequence of his rash aft
i can't seek it in that light said the old gayer
it was a deliberate left from his employers to protected girl he loved
but they couldn have prove in the case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of a resting her were probably of mere bluff
he was soft hearted it impetuous said the and being a love heed stopped to count the cost
if the prosecution withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the fort cheat th the young man would be allowed is freedom
but under the circumstances i down of such an age we could be made
fair he was twelve myles away but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county grail
they were received in the little office by man ne markham who was the jailer
we wish to talk with him answered kenneth top
i reading for representative on the republic con ticket said kenneth quietly
how say that's different observed mark altering is deader

they followed the jailer along the succession of passages

mister grath said kenneth noticing the boy's face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it
sorr we ha it any reception room in the jail
the town please said gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice there's a pens y
afresh wholesome looking boy was ton gates was steady gray eyes from intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather wee mouth
we have heard something of you story said kenneth and our interested in it
i didn't stop to think weathers foolish her not i dad it and un glad i did it
hold well as a fine fellow but poor in helpless since missus rodgers had her accident
then rodgers wouldn't do anything but leader around and wait ponder as the place went her rapt and ruin
he spoke simply but pasted up and down to ner o sell in tram of them
whose name did you assign to the check asked kenneth
he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concert
it's a stop company and rich
i was bit keeper so it was easy to get a boy check and forged the signature
as regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved him a heavy lost one day
i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroy them who plant but mar shall never even thanked thee
it was better for him to think the girl un feeling than to the truth
i'm going to see mister marshal said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thank you sir
it won't be much but him grateful have find a friend
they left him then for the jailer arrived to him not the door and the sport them to the office
i'll see him wil at that kind to my day

he detested at the grasping dispersion that would endeavour to take advantage of his evident desire to help young git
beth are easy a silence mug him
there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face
he might have had that fort check for the face of it if he'd been sharp
had to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars
so to the surprise at the democratic committee an all his friends mister hopkins announced that he w would opposed forts aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
one of mister hoped in's first tasks after calling his faint fulham around him was to make a careful cannas of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
the week need contingency must be strengthen and fortified had a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from opposition
the democratic committee figured out away to do this
under ordinary conditions reals was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to lopt ins
the only thing necessary was too fixed sat reno and this hopton arranged personally
and this was why kenneth beat discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy
the description she gave of the coming reception to the women's political leu was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the objecting of the other vehicle were
these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promise to assist in a liking mister forms
louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted

no words were spoken no language was uttered it save d of wing in hissings and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy anna reality
i heard a noise behind i turned in saw caf his black eyes shining wall in is his hand he how a gaming knife he lifted it above his head as if to strike but i had the strength a ten then and i hurled him from me

no sound broke the stillest of the night
the story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition i wondered what it there was not some truth and what had been said

the three modes of management
to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in affecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and designe
by reason and affection
as the chase drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the doorstep her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexations and i humour surge and swell amongst those delegate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps and a reparable injury
the mother as soon as the chase is so far turned that mary can no longer watch the expression of her confidence goes away from the door where a smile of complacency and satisfaction on her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice
so you will be a good girl i know am not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't do you
the mother in managing the case in this way realized partly un convincing the reason of the childs and partly on an appeal to her affection
if you should not be a good girl what should show signs of making us any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone
but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been habitually managed on mis principle she will not make any trouble
it is indeedy true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection can not be rated
to such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
dollah had a young sister nam maria and a cousin whose name was chain
mow ja contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the mindes of the childrens my means of these dolls
to give idea of these conversations i will report one of them in full
you have come and dea and della was the name of jan sta to make rosily a visit
i am very glad
i expect you have been a very avery good gurl and bellah since you were here last
then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has shep a good girl jane
for instance one day the children had been plain upon the pips with blocks and other play things and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor the pia instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
they were now plain with their dolls in the parlour
delia came to the parlor and with an air of great mystery beckoned the children aside in set to them in a whisper leave and them and rosily here and don't say awd them
so saying she led the way u pico followed by the children out of the room and round by sir cruise rote to the piazza there
said she pointing to the plate things see
p these ble things all away quick and carefully and we will not let them mill anything about talon them out
and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct revues or expressions of this pleasure addressed personally to them would have been
nature of the effect produced by early impressions
that is comparatively nothing
they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
we have going to any such extreme is this we can easily see on reflection how vast an influence on the ideas and conceptions as we was on the principles of action in mature years must be exerted by the nature and characters of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impress upon the mind
the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
but ands cared nothing about that
he made about so deep that his back came mere breaking and he was done founded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but ands
he was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried the jack knife
now this knife was a splendid though half to bladed was gone and the handle with a little cracked and ands new that one is all most a man as soon as one has a jack knife

at the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rose
on huge suf platters were permits of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering the canters
the princess sat down under a o blue canny with boots of roses and she let enter sit in a golden chair by her side
what you must not eat with your camp on your head she said and was going to day get all
the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have daily liked to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any commission
he only shook his head
well what now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him
that is a very fine capt you have he said
so it its sin ands
and it is made of mother's best yarn and she knitted in herself and everybody once to get it away from me
with one jump and got out of his chair
he darted lac an arrow through all the halls down all the stairs and a cross the yards
he still held unto it with bot hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open
but when his big brother herd that he had refused to give his cat for a king's golden and crowned he said that ands was a stupid
ands face grew red
but his mother hu been close

if you dressed him silk and gold from top to te you could not look any nicer than in your little red care
at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five o'clock the king erred his cabinet or his taylors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of s much imagination and had caused so many efforts of fought to the designers and or of an workers of the cort
ah very well
let him come in then said the king and as if cul bare had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himselfe ram with the conversations he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two cart years

he has given them with too much grace not to have otter still to give if they are required which h the case at the present moment
it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned

not at all you are on the contrary most agreeable to me
your majesties planned then in this affair is
you will take them from my private treasure
the news circulated with the rapidity lightning during its progressed kindled every varied of coquetry desire and wild ambition
the kan had completed his toilet by nine o'clock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of treats and flows
the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent days or platform erected upon the borders of the lake it a theatre of wonderful elegance of construction
suddenly for the purpose of restoring piece in order spraying accompanied by his whole court made his appearance
the seasons allies spring followed him closely to form quo which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of dance
his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage in flesh colored silken hoes a silks so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flush itself
there was something in his carriage which resembled the boy movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seemed to sore alone

the king seemed only pleased with everyone present
mons was the only wan who did not understand anything about the matter
the valley began the effect was more than beautiful
when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple unto dured pantomime of that period only the more natural on account of the vari in different acting of the august actors had reached its commin ding point of triumphs the theatre shocks with tumultuous applause
disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgment he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the market preference of the princess
by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that as limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his had drooped as though he was stupified
the king who had from this moment become in reality the principle dancer in the que real cast a look upon his van wiv

the hack alighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if of surprised
like his unfortunate little cousin the teale he too had thought the fear of deaths smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refugees some dark over hanging bank deep friends with weeds where the dreadful i of the hawk should not discern him
the hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface
al most instantly you forced to the top
straightway the hope glided from his perch and darted after him

the hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged and pursuit as a weasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived

the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
would is called perceptions differ from sensations by the fact that the sensational indians bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual correlates all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
whether not principal is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly my seem over statement and it m seem more correct to say that i isis approximate wee represent impressions
and what sort of evidence is logically possible
there is no logical impossibility and the hypothesis that the worlds sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as if thin was with the population that remembered and holy unreal passed
all that im doing is to use its logical tina ability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
the behaves to attempts to make psychology a record of behavior has to trust his memory and making the record
habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behavior is fills confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
but i d do not think such an effects is wanted
our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a france's face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
some images like some sensations fill veryain familiar while others fill strange
familiarity is a flinging capable of degrees
in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel mor familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to ac count for our knowledge of the past
they must have some characteristic which makes us regarded as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
in actual fact their a doubtless various factors that can cur in giving us the flinging of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event
there may be a specific flinging which could be call the filling of fastness especially where immediate memory is concerned
there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of to remembered events
it would seem that only rather recent events can be de placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relations to the present but it is clear that such fillings must plate in essential part in the process of dating remember a ace
if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
remembering has to be a present occurrence in someway resembling or lighted too what is remembered
some points may we taken ass fixed and such as any theory of memory must arriv
in this case as it most others what may be taken u certain in advance is rather they
the first of our vague butt indubitable data is set their is knowledge of the past
we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly the fine memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serves to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve that to rank with memory as regards immediate sey
this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out and practice as it is to draw and theory
a gramma hone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its passed and people are not so different from grown ahs as they like to believe
i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to e for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasions on which he has recited or re it
simmons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not toucht knowledge memory at all closely
they give walls according to which images of pasted currencies come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past a currencies which is what constitutes knowledge memory
it is this that is of enterest to theory of knowledge
it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at sometime
whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it lees us to search the environment until we are satisfy that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone
a further stage is recognition
recognition and this sense does not necessarily involve more that a habit of association the kinds of object rear seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cap of the moment
we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sence and may very probably they impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sinse of the word
this knowledge is memory in on sense though in another it is not
there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might sen at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seem as before than as this has existed before
the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory armand the most important
us if i recognize the thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognized it form's part of my experience by definition the recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is single about from the rest of the worlds
of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually halfman's when we form ad judgment of recognition but that is un avoidable words are framed to expressed a level thought which is by no means perimeter and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
i remain there alone for manny hours but i musk knowledge that before ile the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter and another light

this i felt was pay to me as being president other republick and i endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might be fit the occasion but i could not a feeld that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life
my wife on the spur the a moment mana to give the gentleman a very good dinner
this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with there
then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
oh yes said jack and i'm know where
but i mean to have my innings before law
of what missus never been had gone through in providing bird's beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorow success
we sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then when ashore
how much of evil of reel accomplished evil had there not occurred to me ding the last few days
well c do now but just lay myself down and die
an the death of which i drum could not alas
when this captain should have taken himselfe and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the furthest side of the island and m seclusions would i end my days
jack would become e us happy husband and would remain amiss the hurried duties of the either world
think have all this i went slye
mister never bend began the captain and i observed up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president they cannot feed denyed that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
you have received thus with all that curry in hospitality for which you character in england stand so high
it is a duty said i
but your power is so supper to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it
not a doub but had your force been only double or trouble our own i should have found at my duty to shrug with
that is all quite true mister never then said sir ferdinand brown
i can afford to smile because i am absently parlous before you but i do not to less feel than a matter of which the progress of the worlds concerned i or rather we ha been put down by brute force
you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy doe to the servants of a friendly ally
i can as sure you he has not even alowed me to see the trigger since i had been i on bore
then said sir fer nandou there iss nothing for but that we must take you with him
there came upon the a sudden shop when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
you hear what sir ferdinand brown a sad replied captain battleaxes
