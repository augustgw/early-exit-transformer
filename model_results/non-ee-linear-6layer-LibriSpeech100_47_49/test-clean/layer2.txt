let we say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what are i shall presently give
poor das before his death when it was in sight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on a third of these days and that almo same spot with immense effected he began to read to our hush little circle on the knight of the fourth
the departing ladies who it said they would stay didn't of course thank heavens steady they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a rage of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up
the first at these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tail at appoint afterward it had in a manner begun
he had for his own town residence of bigg house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family placing x that he wished immediately to proceed
the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took ca all his time
they were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority
i don't anticipate

she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that went for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded
but was that all her reward one of the ladies asked
how strange it seamed to the sad woman as she watched the growth than the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that through its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
god as a directs consequence of the sine which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonored bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a bless soul in heavens
yet these thoughts affected has her print less with hope than apprehension
the child had a native grace which does not invariably co exist with faultless beauty it's a tire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were a very garbed that precisely became it best
this outwards mutability indicated and did not more than fairly expressed the various properties of her inner life
esther could only account for the child's characters and even then most mealy and imperfectly by recalling which she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was inviting her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earths
they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind
hester print nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was a committed to her charge
as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment
it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits but hester could not have questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human child
beholding it esther was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little ealth in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearls was fleshing blood and not utterly delusive
brooding over all these matters the mother felted like one who as a bote the spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
pearl was born outcast of the infantile world
curls saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance

he stood pined went one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fanged and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state b though the chances of a popular election had caused the s former ruler to descend a step or tu from the highest drank he still held an honorable an influential place amongst the colonial magistracy
another and far more importantly reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hastor at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
at that epoch of pre stine simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and a far less intoxicate than the wealth there of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with a deliberations of legislators and accent state
the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only cause a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the frame work itself of the legislature

it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life
the mother herself as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorns into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of mor bid ingenuity to create an analogy between the objective of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture
but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scar at letter in her appearance
come therefore and let us fling met it them
but pearl who was a daunt was child after a frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them alt to flight
she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caus the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them
it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and dora b for the admiration of after times
they approached the door which was on an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projections of the edifice in both of which were latticed windows the wooden shutters to close over them that need

with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social like governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of farr state in his native land
on the table and token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind stood a large peter tankard at the bottom of which had hester a pearl peeped into it they might have seen the froth they remnant of a recent draft of ale
little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as he had been with the glittering in front as piece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breast plate
mother cried shee i see you here luck luck
and truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it
pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the vesta of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at crabbe
but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english chastely ornamental gardening
there were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees probably the descendant s of those planted by the reverend of mister blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that half mythological personage who rides through are early annals seeded on the back of the bull
pearl seeing the rose bushes began to cry for a bed rows and would not be passio
he wore blue soap stockings gloomy pants with gold buckles a blue ruffled waist and a jacket and bright blue breaded with gold
his hat had a peaked crowning the flat brim and around the brim was a row of timely golden bells the tinkled when he moved
instead of shoes the old men war boots with turn over tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid
for a long time he had wished to explored the beautiful land of os in which they lived
when they were outside un simply lapsed the door and started up the path
no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
at the foot of the mountain separated the country the munchkins from the country of the gil cans the path divided
he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbor
all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unc an ojo sat on the fallen tree trunk and atee the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket
then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of doctor pied
un cannot at the door of the house and a chubby pleasant faced woman dressed all l blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile
i am my dear and all strangers are welcomed to my home
we have come from the fire lone me a place than this lone ne your place
and you must be ojo thei unlucky she added
odo had never eaten such a fine meal and all his life

the woman seem thoughtful
and one then stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row all bubbling and steaming at a great rat
it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment i am pleased to stay it is nearly done you see im making it for my goodwife margot who wants to you some of it for a purpose of her own

the first lot we detected on our glass cat which not only began to live but has leaved ever since

i think i must show you my patch hor girl said marvel laughing the boy's astonishment for she is rather difficult to explain
but first iver will tell you that from many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the house work and to co form was and wash the dishes
yet that task was th not so easy as you may suppose
a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and collars of cloth only le so together
sometimes it is called a craze ley quilt because the patches and colors or so mixed upo
when i founded did i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colours would discourage her from time to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are
at the emerald city where o princess agate lives green is a popular color
i will show you what a go job i did and she went too it tall covered and threw open the doors
oh youll examined this curious contrivance with wonder
margot had first made the girl's formed from the patch were quilted and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same gay material three out
the head of the patch oor girl was the most curious part of her
the hair was of brown yarn and hung downs on her neckin several neat braids
gold is the most common metal in the land of os and is used for many purposes because it is soft im pliable
no i f gott on about the brains exclaimed the woman
well that may be true agreed margot but on the contrary a servant with too much brains assured to become in dependent in high and mighty and feel above her work
she poured into the dito quantity from each of these bottles
i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in the servant
she ran to her husband side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire
their contents had all a boiled away leaving in the bond of each kettle a fewe grains of fine white powder
very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it altogether in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon
no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
odo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
he selected a small gold of bottle with a pepper box top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any objects through the small holes
most people talk too much so it is a relieved to find one who talks too little
im know allowed to perform magics except for my own amusement he told her visitors as he lighted a pipe where the cookin stem and began to smoke
thews it of os who used to be a humbug and knew no mat tic at all has been taking lessons of glinda and untold the he is getting to be a pretty good wizard but he is merely the assistant to of the great sources

after proceeding a few miles the progress of hock eye who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters

notwithstanding the high resolution of hock eye he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur
in his return to the camp his acute him practised intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of bailing ass asked speaking he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bear singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the a testimony of his own exquisite organs
there was something in his air in the manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind

delivered in a strong tone of ascent announced the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an exhibition of weakness and an enemy so longed hated and so much feared
they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the suppose it conjure to enter
but the bar instead of ban maintain of the seated had taken and growled
the cunning mann as afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the he he received they must stand further off
then as have satisfied of their safety the scout left as position and slowly entered the place
it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
rankest occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful whiffs
the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
what shall we do with the fingers at the door they count six and the singers as good as nothing
the delawares are children of the tortoise and the outstripped the deer
uncas who had already approached the door and readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
but hack eye who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself into his companions
so uncas you'd better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
well what can't be done by main courage in war must be done my circumvention
as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to dave and and gave him his parting instructions
my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust as greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little now that so directly attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
if youre are not then knocked on the head youre being and on compost you will protective you and youll then have a good reasons to expected dieing in your bed
said choose for yourself to make a rush or tarry here
bravely in generously as he battled in my be half and this and more will i dare in his service
keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will served to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
if however they take you her scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
hold s david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i amon unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew and pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practice myself as one without across a blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
god bless you friend i do believe your sein h is not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes don't much depends on the natural gifts in the force of temptation
the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim like to catch the expression of the others features is he afraid
will the hers here his groans
th he can started on his feet and shook a shaggy covering as though the animal he counter fitted was about to make some desperate effort
he had no occasioned to delay for eap a next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
uncas cast his skin and stepped fourth in his own beautiful proportions
i will endeavor in my statement to avoids such terms as would serve to limit the events to an particular place or give a col as to the people concerned
i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasioned he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
without his scrap books his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
i had to read over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
i was absent mother more than an hour
the only du pate which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who has looked after to my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion
the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers
the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together
they'll turner was that someone passing observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
i gave him little brand and left and colled in a chair will i made a most careful samad of the room
a broken tip of glad was lying they also
not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black door or clay with spects of something which would t like saw us dead
above all things i desired to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
to the best of my belief they were rolled up
did anyone knowe that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
i was in such a hur it to come to you you left your door opened
so it seems to me
now mister stones at your sposa
above were three students one on each story
then he approached it and standing on tipt with his net crane he looked into the room
there is no opening except the one paint said are learned guide
i am afraid theyre no signs here said he
one could hardly hope for anny upon so dry a day
you left him a chair you say which caher by the windows there
the man entered and took the papers she by sheet from the central table
as a matter fact he could not said sols for i entered by the side door
how long would to taken to do that using every possible contraction a quarter an h or not less
then he tossed it down and seize the next
he was in the midst of that when your returned caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not times replaced the papers which would tell you that he had been there
misters songs were was someone overwhelmed by this flood of information
coles held out a small ship with the letters and the e and the space of clear wood
whats and i have always done you and injustice there are others
i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished service no i see nothing
as homes tow the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and in alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
hommes turned away and stooped to suddenly to the floor hullo what is this
homes have it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light
what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
i understand you to say that there are three studs use this stair and are the habit of passing your door yes there are
and they are all in for this examination yes
one highly likes to prow suspicion whether no proofs
let usin suspicions i will look
my scull i has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
the top floor belongs tom's the clar
i d not go so far as that but of the three he has perhaps the least unlikely
he was still suffering from the sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life
by ha occasionally on the same thing at over times
did you look at these papers on the tablet
how came you to leave the key in the door
anyone the room could get out yes sir
i really don't think can me much bowed at mister homes
only for a minute are so
o i would not enter to says sir
you haven't seen any of them no sir
it was the indian stark claw appeared suddenly upon his blind
he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
the set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
no names please said homes as we not d gil cry store
of of course he did not realise that it was eye who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances runner suspicious
those very importance homes
you don't seem to realize a position
to morrow was the examination
i cannot be allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been timbered with the situation must be faced
it is possible though i may be an a position then to indicate some course of actions
i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings tre by
when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked at up at the windows
the fou mouse fellow at the top
he is the one with the worst record
why banister a servant whats his game in the matter
he impressed me his being a perfectly honest man
my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders and half humorous resignation
no good my dear watson
i think so you have formed a conclusions
yes my dear wots and i have save the mystery
look at that he held out his hand
on the palm were threes l a pyramids of black dolly clay
and one more this morning
in a fewe hours the examination would commence and he was still int the d lima between making the facts public and allowing the corporate to compute for the value b scholarship
he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched thinkin that you have come
you know him i think so
if this matter is not to be come public we must get ourself certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court marshal
no sir certainly not
there was no man sir
his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon banister in the farther corn
just close the oor said homes
we wanted to know mister gil christ how you an honorable man ever came to commit such an actions out of yesterday
far a moment gil christ with upraised hand tried to control his riding features
come come said homes kindly it is human into air and at least no u concision you of being a callous criminal
well ill don't trouble d answer listen and see that i do you know injustice
he could examine the papers in his own office
but indian i also thought nothing of
when i approached room i examined the windowed
no one less than that would have a chance
i entered and i took you into my confidence as to suggestions of the side table
he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as aware with several sharp spikes
no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the prusse
he put his shoes on the table
gloves said the young man
suddenly you heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
have i told the truth mister deil curs
i had a letter hear misters sam's which i wrote to you early this morning in the it ever restless night
it will be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since she were left in the room and must have locked the door when you w out
it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know
if mister son saw then the game was up
in debate between the senor societies her defence of the fifteenth the ment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
the south she had not thought of of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not averse to charles in or new orleans
john tailor who had supported her thwough college was f interested in cotton
better go he had counsels intent sly

you ought to knowe john if i teach me negroes oll scarcely seen much of people in my own class
at any rate i say go
here she was teach dirty childrens and the smell of confused odors and bodily perspiration was to her times unbearable
she wanted a glance of the new looks in periodicals and talk of great f lant of pies in the forms
so for the hundred time she was thinking to days as she walked alone up the laying back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms
cut she lost
she had almost forgotten that it was here with intent in sight
the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered a murmured before her such away to the northward
it might be a bit of forty here and there but most of this place was such desperate pose
her gard shifted to the green stocks and leaves again and she started to move away
cotton is o wonderful thing is it not boys she said rather primly
miss taylor did that know much about cotton but at least one more remarked seem called for
don't no we'll of all things in would re commented miss taylor litter re bore a cotton and oh well as much as to ask was the use she turned again to go
i those go its too early for them then can the exclusions

now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even that she had been talking just talking there were no persons in the conversation just things one thing c
the honorable charles smiths miss sara's brother was walking swiftly up town from mister easter le's wall steed office and his face was pale
at last the cotton combine was to all a hearses in assured fact and he was slated for the sinnet
why should he not be as other men
she was not herself un notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence and others
as she awaited her guess shes survey the table with both satisfaction andes quietude for her social functions were fewe to night there were she checked them off on her fingers sir james carting the rich english manufacturer and lady citing misters missus banda bull mister harry crest well in his sisters john tailor and his sister and mister charles smith in the evening papers mentioned as likely to be you i state sin itor from new jersey a selection of guess that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of cotton interest earlier in the day
missus grey had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in min vividly their cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith
she was there foremost agreeably surprised to hear mister crest well express himself so cordially as approving of negro education
do believe in some education asked merry taylor
ab beloved in the train in the people to their hasp capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
but crest added significantly capacity defers in nous lay between races
the banda pools were sure this and the englishman instances india became quite eloquent missus grey was mystified but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversations seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharper scrutiny before being allowed much education as and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
whilst of to me hoi added cress well avoiding his sister's eyes
but we a matter exactly welcome
marry t however related the tale of zoah to missus grace private ear later
fortunately said mister ber fool northers in southerners all alarming at that are mutual understanding on most of these matters
he knew the silver fleece his oz as must be ruined
it was the first great sorrow his life it was not so much the loss of a cotton itself but the fantasy the hopes the dreams bil around it
a the swat of the cruel swam
the revelation of his love lighted and right and slowly till at flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in running wonder
he panted to knowe if she too noon or new and cared not or cared and knew not
she was so strange in whom that a creature
the world was water veiled in mists
then it was sudden amid day the sun shot of hot and still no bot of air stirred the sky was like blue steal the earth steam
where was the use of imagining
the lug had been level with the did' to of week ago and now
perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
he started at the thought he hurried fore sadly
he splashed to step the law farther and farther onward until he near the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
then he looked down the look room was dry
he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of all of green f tall wet and willowy
the squares of cotton sharped edge heavy were just about to verse to bows
for one long moment he paused stupid a gate with utter amazement then leaned dizzily against a tree
he gazed about with flexed astonished
here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite worken pain some one had dot can now from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and cooked of way thus allowing it to empty directly
he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was up a most sola
the years of the days of her dinging or ten
the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
up in the sicker rooms or a lay on the little white bed
then met and well of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled and dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that stroll for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weekly she opened her eyes and questioned
for while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at son e bird and tree
she rose with a fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forward wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
she had been borne within its borders within as bor as she had lived and groaned and within its borders she had met her love
on she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island low the cotton lay before her
the chair was empty when he knew
he darted through the trees and caused a tall man strongly but slimily made

hetty soul often took the opportunity when her ant's back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished services for the oaken tablet was usually turned up like a scream and was more for ornament than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round peter dishes there were ranged on the shelves above the longbill dinner table or in the hobbs of the great which always shown like jasper

owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers addison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current

everything he has done has been aimed that the conservation of energy the contractions of space the intensification of culture
for saw years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously
it could not be used for elector plating or deposition nor could it charge stage batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current
but one it came to be a questions of lighting u scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a far mouse the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and is ideal

unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly government regulated than those available for his dio and lamp addison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give us steady light
mister edison was a leader far ahead of the time
he obtained the desired speeded and lord but a friction break also regulator speed but waited for an indicated to verified it
then again thereas was no known way two lubricate an engine for continuous running and mis jades in formed me that as a marne engines started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine for his his purposes mus produced light at all times
addison had in stalled his his stork first great central station system the new york on the multiple arch system covered by his feeder and maine invention which resulted in unable saving in the cost of conductors as against the straight t w system throughout out of the tree kind
he soon for sawing that still greater economy would be necessary fore commercial success not alone for the larger cheerily opening but for the compact district of large cities
the strong position held by the ed sen system under the strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wi assistant and had gave an immediate impidence to incessant lighting
it wast specially suited for a trial plan also in the early days when a yielded six or eight lamps to the horse power was consider subject for congratulation
the street conductors were of the overhead hole line construction adoring stalled by the construction in company that had been organized by edison to build and equip central stations
meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three whar system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor johns hopkinson and mister edison being independent in vents at practically the same time
i thinking was perhaps more appreciative than i was of the discipline of the edison construction department and fought it would be well for us to wait until the morning the fourth before we started th

they were later years as reserved machines on finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection live at asia but they remained in practically as good conditions as when installed in eighteen eighty three
the arc lamp and stalled outside a customs premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate four hours when the lamp might be out through res of it
et soon held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gasp or water any proceeded to develop a meter
there was infinite skepticism around him on the subjects and while other inventors were also giving the subject bere thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or wig and only gave secondary evidence of itself that the exact pointed use could not be brought to accurate registration
hence the attis and electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
the principle employed in the attis and electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to dee impose a chemical substance
associated with the simple forms of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tempering as would permit theft of current or damage
the standard edison neither practice was to remove the selves once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another sat being substituted
in december eighteen eighty eight mister wu j jenks red an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practically experience had up to that time with the meter than more generally in use than any other
the others having been an operation too short at time to show definite results although they also w quickly to a divide and basis
in this connections it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effects that the edison meet was occurred and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station semen current by meter
the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century
he wait and re away the meter plates and pursued everye investigation imaginable but all in vain
he felt he was up against it and it perhaps other kind of a job would soon him better
the problem was soled
we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part
we had meters in which they were two bottles of liquid

he cried in high dudgeon just as if he owned a whole at the fevers and could dispose at them all to suit his fancy

mur sighed
a b s quinn had come up and was driving puppy white clouds across the sky
the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
that invitation decided her

if exciting was everything growing so fast and to get the grass cot

in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pale and he began to swing his side with that long even stroke that view american boys sever learned
very pick cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering ranch after matter shivering when she thought a shower of rain drop on her neck and hair
and aim meal moee his way slowly down towards the cherry trees
that summer the reins had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than chauta and his man could do kep up with the corse the orchard was an neglected wilderness
i don't know all of them but i no b nance are
if i feel that way ideal that way
he reached up amongst the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit long ivor coloured berries tipped with mint pink like white carl but fall to the ground unheeded all summer through
he dropped a handful into her lap
yes don't youre
oh ever soon match only you seems kind of stay at and school teacher
when shes to tell me about him what always wondered whether she wasn't for little and love with him

mar's face fell under his brooding gaze
i am sure alexander hope he you will say on here she murmured
i don't not to stand around i look on

then all our good times are over
saturday august fifteen the sea unbroken all round no land in sight
the horizon seems extremely distant
all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am will his nature has resumed it sway
you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye anxious
one might be would bless reason than now
i am not com playing that the rainest slow but that the seat is so wide
we are is in time and the fact is i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on her brett
he called the sea a prawn at longed the wag taking a little sail
therefore don't talk me about views and prospects
i take this is my answer and i leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience
sunday august sixteenth
nothing knew whether unchanged the wind freshens
but there's seen no reason a fear
the shadow of the wat was clearly outline upon the surface of the waves
truly the sea is of infinite wit
it lust be as wide as a mediterranean or the atlantic and one right
these thoughts agitated me all day in my imagination scarcely calm down after several outsleep
i shudder as i recall these monstrous to my remembrance
i sawed the hammer muse the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length
i suppose professor leading brack was of my opinion too and even shared my fears after having examined the pick his eyes traversed the ocean from side the side
tuesday august eighteenth
daring his watch i slim
two hours afterwards a terrible shock of lo me
the raft was heated up on a watry mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms
there's a wale awa cried the professor
flight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they willed around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of expressed trains
two monster's only retreating all this commotion and before my eyes are too reptiles of the primitive world
i can distinguish the eye of it the assist glowing like a red hot cove and as large as a man's head
its jaws enormous and according naturalist is ad with no less than one hundred and eighty two teeth
those huge creatures attack each other with a greatest animosity
suddenly the it dia assist and the planty source disappear below leaving war pole eddying in the water
as for that if the as source as he returned to suma in cavern
the wings become lost in the distance
the weather if we may use the ter will change before law
the atmospheres charge with vapors provided with the at triced generated by the evaporation of sailing waters
the electric light con scarcely penetrate to the dance curtain which is dropped over the theatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged
the air as is heavy the sea is calm
from time to time a fleecy tuft of mins we yet some gaming light left upon it pros down upon the dense fu of grey and loses itself in the oa and impenetrable mass
the atmosphere as evidently charged and sir charge with chu city
the wind never lowes but to acquire increase strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge res vor a fearful windy gusts and rushing storms
there's a heavy stormed coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon
those clouds seem as if they were going to quest the sea
on the mast already i see the light play of lament the saint ails fire the ostrich still catches not a breath of wind and hangs like sheet of led
but if we have now ceased to advance why do we leave that sale loose which it the firsts shock of a tempest may caps us us in a moment
that will be the safe this no no never
the pounded up vapors contents in the water and the air put in the violent action to supply the bacon left by the cons s of the mist rouses itself into a whirlwind
harm stairs nighte
from the under surface of the clouds there are continuous missions of lurid light electric matter is in continual evolution from their component moles is the gashes elements of the air and to be slight with moisture for amble columns of water rushed upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam
i referred of the the mommet it indicates a figure is obliterated
is the atmosphere condition having once reached sensitive to become final
the raft bears ar still to the south east
at noon de valance of a stormy doubles
each of us is lashed to some part of the raft
the waves rise above our heads
they seem to be we are lost but i'm not sure
he nods his consent
the farm half of it wipe half azure blue and the size of a ten inch show love sol it about a raft but revolving on its own axis for astonishing philos as if whipped round by a force of the whirlwind
here comes they it glides now its up the ragged stump of the mast thence it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just skins the powder magic heine horrible
we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disc of mysterious light nimbly leaps side it approaches harms who fixes his blue eye upon its steadily it threats the head of my uncle who falls upon its knees but his head down to avoided
a suffocating smell of knight g had fills the air it enters the throat it fills the lungs
we suffer styling pains
and now odd the directions for look
poor alice
it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed the pair wite kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering tor himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess
oh what she be savage if i'm kept her waiting
i was took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hut she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day
and yesterday thinks we unjust is usual
i would have i've been changed in the night
i almost stake i can remember feeling a little different
i'll try if i knows all the things i used to know
i shall never to t t twenty at that rate
how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome a little fishes in would gently smiling jaws
no i've made up my mind about it if i'm mabel i'll stay down here
it'll be noe use there're putting their heads down and saying come up again dear
i'm so very tired being all alone here
and i declare its too bab that it is
i wish i han cried so much said alice and she swim about trying to flat her way out
i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears
that will be a queer thing to be sure
i am very tar to swinging about here oh mouse
cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
we won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not we indeed
we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
the conditions that i will be permitted to make lo her talk american stream light him s to speaks because you will never get people whether anne outside the luther in church actually to read luther unless we make him talk as he would talk to day to americans
let us begin with that his commons hy undulations
the undertaking which seems so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved the most difficult one and at times became oppressive
it was written in luton
the word had to be convinced
or word should now be set about the origin of l thur's commentary undulations
much later one a friend of his was preparing additions of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine mats for instance
in other words these three men took down the lectures which loo her a addresses guns in the course of gits and roar prepared the man spurred for the printer
it presents like no other of lu thur's writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the center for the sake of cric merits alone
but the essence of l d's lectures is there
the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do loop too

in every way they sought to undermine authority of sein paul
they said to the glass youre have no right to thinkingly of paw
he was the last to turn the christ
cock him waiter and as beneath us
indeed he persecuted the church a christ for a long time
do you suppose that god for the sake of a fewer thur inherits would disown his entire church
against these boasting false apostles p boldly defence his apostolic authority in ministry
as the ambassador a government is honoured for his office and not first private person so the minister off cry should exalt his office in order to again authority among men
pul takes pride his ministry not to his own phrase but to the praise of god
paul and apostle not of men et cetera
heather he called ministers to the agency of men or he calls them directly as he called the prophets and apostles
pa declares that the false of pistoles were crawled their sent neither by men nor by men
the most they could claim as if they were sent by others
he mentions the apostles first because they re appointed directly by god
be ca was not to be taken lightly
for person of possess knowledge is not enough
is spoils on's best work
when i was younger man i thought pall as making too much of his call
i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
i knew nothing of the doctrine f because i retz sofa stream stead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
this is no sinful pride it is wholly pride
and god the father who raised him from the dead
the classing superfluous on first side
these perverts of the richness of christ resist the father and the sun and the works of them both
in this whole whistle pall treats of the resurrection of chris
by his resurrection christ one the victory over laws sin flesh world devil death hell and every evil
first two
and all the brethren in which are wist me
they sh go far and shutting the mouse of the false possums
although the bothering with be they not apostles like myself yet there all of one mind with me thinkin and teach as i do
they do not go with the enemies of the gospel predominate they go over the christians are
why then not invade the calf of provinces and preached their doctrine to godness princes bishops and doctors as we have them by the help of god
we look for that rewards which i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man
not all the gits had become prevert it
these means cannot be continent
they remained divine regardless of men' opinion
wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church even th ant criest rooms there
so much for the title of the a pistol now follows the greeting of the apostle first three
grace be too you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
the terms of grace and piece are common turns with paul and are now pretty well understood
the greeting of the apostles refreshing
grace involves though mission of sends peace and a happy conscience
the world wrens this a pernicious doctrine
experience process
however the grace and piece of gods will
men should not speculate ab the nature of gone
was it not enough to say from god the fathers
to do so as to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure into comprehend his infinite majesty
he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes me fasten upon him
embrace him and forget up in nature her god
did not chris himself say i am the way in the truth and the life no man cometh into the father but by me
when you are you about the the tre god apart from the question of justification you mayas profound as you like
we are to hear christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teachers
at the same time pal confirms our creek that christ is very god
that christ is very god is apparent in that pul scribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to the spens grace and peace
to bestow peace and grace lies in the province of gods who alone com create these pleasance the angels cannot
otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and pans from my lord jesus christ
theer ands took chris for a noble and perfect creatures superior evened the angels because by him god created heaven and earth

the greatness of the ransom christ some of god indicates this
the vicious characters of sin has brought out by the words who gave himself for u sins
will we are careless we make light of sin
we think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss
this passage then there is out effect that all man are sold andersen
this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sand as a small matter easily taken care of by good works but we must present ourselves e to god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before m feel that christ was given for our sins
this attitudes universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon their

tabby had lived with them for ten or told years and was as charlotte expressed it one of the family
he refuse at first to listens to the careful advice it was repugnant to his liberal nature
this decision was communicated to the girls
tabby had tented them in their childhood they and none others should tended her in her infirmity an age
at tea time there were sad and silent and the meal went to way and touched by any of the three
she had another weight on her mind this christmas

to celebrate the arrival of her son sylvia gave a splendid supper to which she had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance
without saying it positively she made me understand that being herself an illustrious number of the republic of letters she was as well aware that she was speaking to an insect
in order to please her i spoke to her of the abbey conti and i had occasioned to quoth to lines of that profound writer

slum was the adoration of france and her talent was the real supports of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her especially of the plays of mara lu for without her h his commodities would never have gone to posterity
sylvia did not think that her good conduct was a merit for she knew that she was as virtuous only because herself love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any pride or assumed many s peri towards her theatrical sisters all those satisfied the shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue
two years before her deathly i sawing her performed the characters of merry anne in the comedy of mirabel an in spite of her age and declining health the og was complete

the strollers took their part in it with hardy ses now that they had some chance of beating off their foes
robin in the little tumbler between them ty to force the squire to stand back and very valiantly did these two comport themselves
the head and chiefly the riot bingham apprentice with clench fists threatened montfichet
the squire helped to thrust them all in and entered swiftly himself
now be silent on your lives he began but the capture apprentice set up an instant chou
silence you knave cried month bouchet
he felt fern found the wise it's black cloth the squire was quite out of breaths
thrusting opened the proper entrance of the tent robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden with a great shout
a mohun a looky s gan well to the rescue
taking advantage of this the squires fewe men redoubled their efforts and encouraged by robins in the little strollers cries fought their wait to him
george montier will never forget this day

he made an effort to hide his condition from them all and robin felt his fingers tighten upon his arm
begged ne a room of the sheriff child quickly
but who is his fellow plucky at into speak
he is my esquire excellency returned robin with dignity
mistress fut had been carried off for the serf's daughter in her maids soon as they had entered the house to that robin alone had the care of moony sh
robin was glad wind at length they were left to their own devices
the wind d had certainly bring back the color to the squatters cheeks
these escapades are not for old gain will lad his day has come to twilight
with you forgive me now
itll will be no disappointment to me
no thanks i am glad to give you such easy happiness
you are worthy you lead you will presently whispered groin the whine is worked a marfa
i and show you some pretty tricks
young fits had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his congress with the squire
there be fell an anxious interview mistress fs arguing four and against the squire's projecting breaths
most of all robin thought of his father what would he counsel
if fer w you beggar yourself i cannot stay you
but take it whilst d i live and where mony chase shield in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so brave a sight for you will narrow disgrace our stutter and i warrant me
the wat ejected then
never that s he said
he was in deep conversed with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arms
now to bedad boy
tis late and i go myself within a short space
dismissed your squire robin and bide good een
as any in england i would say said came well proudly that is in his day
yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come
there was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to game those chamber
presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided steps
will cried he softly and studley who had chosen his coun across the door of his young master's chamber sprang up at once an answer
we will go out together to the bower theres a way down to the course for my window
rest and be still until they warn you
the hours passed we ely by and move it could get be heard about the hall
at last all was quiet in blacken the courtyard of gamewell
will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready
they then renewed their journey and under the better light made a save crossing of the stable roofs
robin entered the hut dragging the unwilling esquire after him
be not so foolish friend s f tooth crossly
they moved thereafter cautiously about the hut groping before about them to find something to show that moreton it fulfilled his mission
they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stoutly had tripped over the edge of the reversed flat mouth of this pit
f sooth sa hand rested it at last upon the toper run of the latter and slowly the truth came to him
robin fearfully descended the later and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground
stoutly was by his side in the flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape in characters of his vaults
from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice war wantons
safely masters but you startled me rarely
cried he waving the lane before him to make sure that these were no ghost in front of him
inquired robin with his suspicion still upon him
truly such a horse would be worth much in nodding him there
day n lording answered warrant and with a half laugh
warrington spoke thus with significance to show robin that he was not to think jeff's claimed to the estate willy passed by
robin fits sooth saw that his doubts of warr won had been unfair and he became ashamed to themself for harbouring them
his tones ran pleasantly on warrenton's ears and forthwith a good fellowship was heralded between them
the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gave weve that this passageway led from the hut and of pleasance to sure wood and that jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
he implores us to be discreet as the grave and this matter for in sooth his life is in the hollow of our hands
they regained their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gamewell
out in the woods stood a nice little fur tree
the place he had was a very good one the sun shone on him as a fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as furs
he did not thinking of the warms sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cotta children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
but this was what be tree could not bear to hear
in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hair would often come leaping along and jumped right over the little tree
that made him so angry
to grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most of light ful thing in the worlds
in autumn the woodcutters always came and fells and of the largest trees
this happened every year and the young firry that had now grown to a very comely sized trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earths with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and bare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were lid in carts and the horses dragged of them out of the wood
have you not met them anywhere
re joy s in thin growth said the sunbeams
and been what happens then
i would thing no if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last ear oh
where i but al ready on the carts
where i in the more room with all the splendor in magnificence
yes and something better something still pandar will surely follow or where for should they bus ornament me
something betters something still grander must follow but what
we joy s in our presents said the air and the sunlight
re choice in my own fresh youth
but p tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter and summer
and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
the acts struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pangs like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful at being separating from his home from the place where he had sprung up
he well you that he should never see his dear olds comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
the departure was not at all agreeable
the tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyards with the other trees and heard a man say that one splendent we don't want the others
there two were large easy chairs silken sols large tables full of picture bucks and full of toys were hundreds and the hundreds of crowns at loosed the childrens and so
the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
this evening they al said
how it will shine this evening
perhaps the other trees from the forest will conge look at me
a blazed up famously out help
cried the young ladies i they quickly put out the fire
a story
a story cried the childrens drawing a little fatted man towards the tree
but i shall tell only one story
humpy don't be fell downstairs and yet he married the princess
that's the way of the world
thought the fur trye and believe it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
i wont trembled to moro thought the fir tree
and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought
in the morning the servants and the housemaid came in
but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here it a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
what the meaning of this bought be tree
and he leaned against the wall lost and revery
time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did comely it was only to puts some great trunks in a corner out of the way
it is now winter out of doors thought the tree
how kind man is after all
if d they were not so dark here and so terribly lonely
sleep slick
they snuffed about the fir tree and rustled amongst the branches
i am by no meanes old said the fir tree
there's mo one considerably older than i am
they were so extremely curious
i know no such place said the tree
and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said
said the fur tree thinking over what he had himself related
yes in reality those were happy times
h is humpy don't p asked the mice
only that one answered the tree
it is a very s stupid story
don't you know one about bacon and tello candles canst you te andy lu stories
no said the tree
then g by said the rats and they went o
at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listened to what i told them
now that too was over
why one morning there came e quantity of people and set tow work in the loft
the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs whereat the daylight shone
but it was not the fir tree that big meant
it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
the gold and star of tins was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
in the courtyards some of the merry children were playing who had danced a christmas round the fir tree and were so glad at the sight of him
and the gardeners boy chopped tree to small pieces there was a whole heat lying there
the wood flam ups splendidly under the large brewing copper and its side so te ply
however that was over and now the tree gone the story as an end
an if them beth refrained from doing the other girls or uncle john of old will rogers visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned you closely about the penalty for fortune e check
it was a serious crib indeed mister watson told them and d gates bade fared to serve length the termed in the states prison as a consequence of his rash aft
i gan see it if that light said the old lawyer
it was a deliberate c left from his employers to protected girl he loved
but they could not have prove the gee against lucy if she was innocent and all their threads of arresting her were prob'ly a mere bluff
he was soft hearted and impetuous said b and being in love hed and stopped to count the cost
if the prosecution were withdrawn and the c settled with the victor of the forge check then the younger man would be allow as freedom
but under the circumstances i doubt of such an argent could be made
fair view was twelve miles away put by tense o'clock they drew up at the county trail
they were received in the little office by a man ne markham who was the jailor
we wish to talk with him answered kenneth talk
i'm wading for representative on their republican ticket said kenneth quietly
how say that's different observed markham alter is demeter
may be see gates at once asked kenneth
they followed the jailor along the succession of passages
sometimes on that year and for a smoke on merely crazy and not though which is gorse dined one ware or ether
he un locked the doorin called here's visitor's tom
worse tom or sin error replied the jailor cloy
mister graft said kenneth noticing the boy's face critically as he stood were the light from the passage fell upon it
sire we have an any reception room and the jail
satou pleas se gates nature ful in pleasant voice there's a pins yure
a fresh wholesome looking boys tom gates with was steady gray eyes and intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather week mouth
we have heard something of your story said kenn ith and are interested in it
i didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and i'm glad i did it
hold well as a fine fellow but poor in helpless since missus roger's had her accident
then rogers wouldn't do anything but leader around and wait upon her and the place went or racked in ruin
he spoke simply but paced up and down to narrow cell inn of them
whose nam did your sign to the check asked kenneth
he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concert
its a stop company in rich
i was bit keeper so it was easy a get appoint check and forced the signature
as regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved to him a heavy loss one day
i discovered and put out afire that would have destroyed the whole plant the marshall never e them thanked me
it was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than know the truth
i'm going to see mister marshal said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thanky sir
it won't be much but am grateful to fine a friend
they left him them for the jailer arrived to a lock the door and escort them to the office
i'll see wots to that kind to my day
and it ruins of ann's dispositions
he looked up rather and gracious sweep at motion them to be seated
some girls that in here twice to inter view m men and i have refused to admit her

i'll pale all the caus besides
you're foolish why should you do of this
i have mail reason's mister mercia
give me a check for under fifty had i'll turn over to you the fort check and est fur the proceedings
he detested the grasping dispiteous that would endeavour to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gates
beth uneasy at his twen matched him
there was a grin smile of amusement on his shrewd face
he might have had that forge check for the face of it if he been sharper
had to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars
so to the surprise of the democratic committee ana his friends mister hopkins's announced that he would oppose forts aggress of campaign with an equals aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
one of f miser hoped in's first tasks after calling his faithful henchman around him was to make a careful countess of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
the weak need contingency must be strengthen and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from oppositions
the democratic committee figured out away to do this
under ordinary conditions rebels was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to a i cop gins
the only thing necessary was too fix seth renal and this hoped ands arranged personally
and this was why kenneth and bath discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy
the descriptions she gave of the coming receptions to the women's political wee was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the object of the other vehicle were
these women were flattered by the attentions of the young lady and had promised to assist in a ling mister forts
louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so affective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted
the fair view pound was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the res horses of the great house were tax to entertain the guests
tables were spreads on the al and the dainty but subs repast was to be served
this was the first occasions within a generation when such an entertainment had been given at elmhurst and the only when within the memory of man where the neighbours and country people had been me invited guess

for the first time the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor
she sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rob slowly back and forth i'm sorry said beth
eliza parsons shook her head
they they excite me in some way and i i can't bear them you must excuse me
she even seemed mildly amused at the attentions she attracted
beth was a beautiful girl the handsomest of the three cousins by far yet eliza surpassed her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact
her matter was neither independent nor corti but rather one of well bread composure and calm relies
her eyes wonder to the maids hands

the story of its ev influence came back to me and in my bewildered conditions i wondered what it there was not some truth and what had been said

my tong worth used to are tak my power of speech laughed me
my position was too terrible
my over roc yur she d n last
for some time after die i remembered nothing distinctly
the three modes of management
to suppose that the objects of this work is to aid in affecting such a substitution is that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
by reason and affections
as the chase drives away merry stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step her mind in a tumults of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexation and ill a humor serge and swell amongst those delicate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps and a reparable injury
the mother as soon as the chase iss so far turned that marry can no longer watch the expression of her confidence goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and sis faction on her face at the ingenuity an su excess of her little artifice
so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but well stay at home contentedly won't you
the mother managing the case in this way realised partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection
if you should not be a good girl what should show sides of making us any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house untill we are gone
but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been habitually managed on miss principle she will not make any trouble
it is indeed true that the importance of tacked and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection cannot be overrated
to such persons these intellect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
deah had a younger sister nam mara and a cousin whose name was jane
now delia contrived to obtain a great influence and simonson over the minds of the children by means of these dolls
to give idea of these conversations i will will report one of them in full
you have come and della and bela was the name re jan stall to make rosily a visit
i am very glad
i expected you have been a very good girl and tela since you were here last
then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has shep been a good girl jane
for instance one days the childrens had been plain upon the pax with blocks and other play things and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of v piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
they were now plaining with their dolls in the parlour
dell he it came to the parlor and with an air of great mystery that can the children aside and set to them in a whisper leave and della and rosy here and don't say awards them
so saying she led away on tito followed by the children out of the room and round by a sir cours roof to the piazza there
said she pointing with the play things see
p these plea things all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know anything of aboute them about
and this method of tree the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any directly rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been
nature of the effects produced by early impressions
that is comparatively nothing
they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
we have going to any such extreme as this we can easily see on reflection how vast in influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action in mature years must be exerted by the nature and characters of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impress upon the mind
the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
but ands cared nothing about that
he made a bout so deep that his back came near breaking and he was done founded i can tell you when he sawn it was nobody but ands
he was such a bigg boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife
now this knife was a splendid though half the blab was gone and the handle was a little cracked and ands knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife
yes why not thought enters
see that i ams so fi i may as wells it the king
i'm going to the court ball answered landers
and she took enters hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every thirds step and through the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk anden velvet stood bowing wherever he went
for like as not they must have thought him a prince when they saws fine cap
at the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rose
on hu silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wines sparkled in glittering de canters
the princess sat down under a blue canopy with bookcase of roses and she lit and her sit in a golden chair by her side
but you must not eat with your count on your head she said and was going today get off
the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kiss by he but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any commission
he only shook his head
well what now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his necks and bent down and kissed him
that is a very fine cap you have he said
so its sents
and it is made of mother's best yarn and she knitted it herself and everybody wants to get it away from me
with one jump enters get out of his chair
he darted lake an arrow through all the halls down all the stairs and across the yards
he still held on too it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open
but when his big brother hed that he had refused to give his count for a king's golden crown he said that ands was a stupid
and' his face grew red
but his mother hug been close
no my little son she said
if you dressed in soil and gold from top to to you could not look any nicer th in your little red cap
at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five o'clock the king entered his cabinet were his tailors or were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the resulted so much imagination and had caused so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the corpse
ahhh very well
blood him come in them said the king and as if cold bere had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself okochee as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two cartier's
gentle a dear posts whereupon sayed annon and few lor right too thir leave
certainly sire but i must have money to do that what
what do you you mean inquired louise
he has given them with too much grace not to have ur still to give if they are required which as the case at the present moment
it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned
does your majesty then no longer believe the dis royal attent
not at all you are on the contrary most agreeable to me
your majesty's planned then in this affair is
you will take him from my private treasure
the news circulated with the rapidity lightning during its progress had kindled every vari of coquetry desire and wild ambitions
the kan had completed his toilet by nine o'clock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flows
the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent das or platforms erected upon the borders of the lake it a theatre of wonderful elegance of constructions
suddenly for the purpose of restoring piece in order springing accompanied by his whole court made his appearance
the seasons allies of spring followed him closely to form a quad real which after many words of more or less flattering important was the commencement of the ants
his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to grat advantage in flesh colored silken hoes a silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flush itself
there was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seemed to sore along
yes it is suppressed
far from its sire your majesty had in given no not directions about it the musicians have retained
yes s and ready dressed for the valley
sire he said your majesty's most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasioned with similar zeal that he is already shown on the field of battle
the king seemed only pleased with everyone present
monsieur was the only wand who didn not understand anything about the matter
the valley began the effected was more than beautiful
when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutored pantin of that period only the more natural on account of the van different acting of the august actors had reached its commin hating point of triumphant the theatre shook with tumultuous applause
disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgment he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the mark preference of the princess

the king who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quad reel cast a look upon his vanquish rival
everyone could observe his agitation and prostration a prostration which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and his eyes with all their bright intelligence be domned

and would have seemed that a trout of this size will a fairly substantial meal
but such was his keenness that even wh the wide flecks of his endured to victim were still sticking out of the cars of his beak his fierce redd eyes of were once more appearing downward into be torrent and search of fresh prey

in fact he had just finish ship the lass of the trout's tail had just finished with a spasm down hiss strained g it when the baffled hawk called sight of him and swooped
the hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as a surprised

the hawk sat upon the branch and walked his quar swimming beneath the surface

but as before the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer and ely able to flap his way onward and a cloud of foam old doom hung low above his head get hesitated to strike
the hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged and pursuit as a weasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived
he had a lot of line out and the place was none too free for a long cast but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was speeding
the last drop fly as luck with hab it caught just in the corner of the hawks angrily opened beak hooking itself firmly

the analysis of knowledge will were occupies until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficulty part of our whole enterprise
what is called perception difference from sensation by the facts that the sensational andre hands bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual courts all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
whether not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly my seem it overstatement and it my seem more corrects to say that i does approximately represent impressions
and what sort of evidence is logically possible
there is no logical impossibility and the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it there was with the population that remembered a wholly unreal past
all that i dinging is to use its logical ta ability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
the the horus to attempts to make psychology e record of behavior has to trust his memory in making the record
habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the the haig rest fills confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
but i do not thinks such an inference is warranted
our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself sinse we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a france face vividly and clearly but poorly distorted
some images like some sensations fill very familiar while others full strange
familiarity as a filling capable of degree
in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel mor familiar than others when dis happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the flinging of greater or less remoteness in some remembered if that
there may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of pastes especially where immediate memory is concerned
there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such fillings must play an essential part in the process of dating remember advance
if we had retained the subjects or acte in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or later to what is remembered
some points may be taken as as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive out at
in this case as a most others what may be taken a certain and advance is rather they
the first of our vague good but indubitable data set there is knowledge of the past
we might provisionally that perhaps not quite correctly to fine memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serves to mark the problems with which we are concerned those some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediate sey
this distinction is vile to understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draws in theory
i gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from grandi pens as they like to believe
i can sit to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
the fact that a man can recite the poem does not show to he remembers any previous occasions on which he has recited or read it
simmons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
they give walls according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our believe for these image is refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
it is this that is a vent interest to theory a knowledge
it is by no means always were liable almost everybody has at som time experienced the well known illusion that all that has happening now happened before at some time
whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite obstinate it res us to search the environment until we are satisfy that we have found the appropriate objects which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone
a further stage is recognition
the recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more that a habit of association the kind of objects we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize and objects that we have seen it before but this judgment is as something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word
this knowledge is memory and once sense though another it is not
there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to again with it might seen at first sight more corrected to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
the definition of my experience is difficulty broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory ar among the most important
thus if i recognize the thing the occasion of its previous existence and virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition the recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is single out from the rest of the world
of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form ad judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level thought which is by no m means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as it recognition
i remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter and another light

missus never b you mustn't indeed be proud of your son
jack had been standing in the four corner of the room talking too either and was now reduced the silenced by his praises

this i felt was pay to me as being president other republic and i endeavoured to behave myself such mingled humility and dignity as might be fit the occasion but i couldn a feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my winny life
my wife on the spur the moment managed to give the gentlemen a very good dinner
this she said was true hospitality but i am not sure id did not agree with there
then never three y or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
oh yes s said jack and i'm nowhere
but i mean to have my innings before long
of what missus never ben had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and gales for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished tasks with thorough success
we sat with the officers some little time after dinner and then went ashore
how much of evil of reel accomplished evil had there not occur to be during the last few days
well cow do now but just lay him myself down and die
in a death of which i drip could not alas
when this captains should have taken himself and as vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the furthest side of the island and m seclusions what i end my days
jack would become e as happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world
thinking of all this i went to slep
mister never ben began a captain and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president there cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
you have received us with all that courses and hospitality for which your characters in england stands so high
it is a duty said i
but your power iss so su appeared to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it
not a del but had your force been only double or trouble our own i should have found at my duty to struggle with you
that is all quite true mister never ben said sir ferdinand brown
i can afford to smile because i am absently parlous before you but i do the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the worlds concerned i or rather we have been put downs by brute force
you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have had been on boor
then said sir fernando there's nothing for it but that we must take you with him
there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
you hear what sir fer men oll brown a sad replied captain battle axe

lieutenant crosstrees is a very gallant offers sir

what world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crush them both by my words had it been possible my dislike centered itself on sir fer and mow

and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose cue story might well meet with some skepticism

before any good stop him he butted his majesty so furiously that the king sorts farn into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay mony and grown
de goats warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack

the combine bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served
rider than early dawns most brilliant die ar blown clear bands of color through the sky that swirl and sleep and meat to break and foam like rainbow veils upon a bugles done
guided by you howl we might stroll towards stiff our only music one another's breath through a gardens intimate with hollyhocks where silent poppies burn between the rocks by pools where birches been to confidence above green waters strummed with a lily plants
ven is
in a sunset glowing of crimson and gold she lies the glory of the world a beached king's galley who sails are furrowed he was hung with tapestries rich and old
the pity that we must come and go
while the old gold and the marble stays forever gleaming is soft strong blaze calmed and early evening glow
they pleasant graveyard of my souls with sentimental cyprus trees and flowers is filled that i m stroll and meditation at my ease
it is my heart hung in the sky and no clouds ever fluted between the grave flowers than my heart on high
over the track lin city street the young men the grinning men pass
h knee sails that seemed to wonder and dram filled mens say is the shore where i stand the only filled of struggle or are y hit and battered out there by waves and windus as hede over a question sea of watery echoes
owned dances are simplified at their yearning breached by time
he had got into her courtyard
threw the black night rain he sang to her window bars
that was but rustling of dripping plants in a dark
she was alone net night
he had broken into her courtyard
to fay away like morning beauty from her mortal vay down by the river a abdon ea her softe voices heard and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning due
own life of this our spring
why fads the lotus of the water
why fad these children of the springing
fell is like a watry bow and like a parking cloud like a reflections in a glass like shadows in the water like dreams of infants likely a smile upon it an infants face
like the do's voice like transient day like music in the air ahhh
and gentle sleep the sleep of deaths and gently hear the voice of him that walked it in the garden in the evening time
the willy of the valley breathing in the humble grass answered the lovely maid and said i am a watry weed and i am very small and loved to dwell in lowly veils so weak the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head yet i am visited from heavens and he that smiles on all walks in the valley and each morn over me spreads his hand saying rejoiced thou humble grass thou newborn g lily flower
thou gentle made of silent valleys and of modest brooks for thou shall be clothed in the light and fed with morning manna till summers heat melts le a side the fountains and the springs to flourish in eternal veils they whys should fell complain
why should the mistress of the veils of par but to a sigh
she ceased and smiled and tears then sat down in her silver shrine
which thou dust scatter on every little blade of grass that springs revives the milked cow and tames the fire breathing steed
but thou is like a fain cloud kindle that the rising sun i vanish from my pearly throne and who shall find my place
and why it scatters its bright beauty through the human air
descended a little clown and hovered before the eyes of fell
o little clouds the virgins said i charged thee to tell me why thou complain as now when in one hour thou fat away then we shall seek thee but not finde ah thou is like to thee
i pass away yet i complain and no one hears my voice
the clouds showed his golden head and his bright form emerged
and fierce thou because im vanish and im see no more
it is too ten full of life to love to peace and raptures wholly unseen descending way my light wings upon balmy flours and court the fair are do to take me to her shining intent the weeping virgin trembling meals before the risen son
till we arise linked in a cold and band and never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flower
lives not alone nor of itself fear not and i will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice
come fourth warm and the silent valley to th ae pensive queen
the helpless worm a rose and sat upon the lilies leif and the bride clouds sail on to find his partner in the veil
image of weakness art thou but a worm
i see they way helpless and ma weeping and none to answer none to cherish thee with mother's smiles
and says thou mothers of my children i have loved thee and i have given the a crown that none can take away
and lay me down in thy cold bed and leave my shining locked
or an i of gifts and graces showering fruits and coined gold
why a tongue impressed with honey from every wind
why an ear a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in
always said a word
i sent beneath thy looks as childrens do in the noon son with souls that tremble through their happy irelands from an una verd yet prodigal inward joy
i did not wrong myself so but i placed a wrong on thee
when called before i told how hastily i dropped my flowers or break off from a gain
shall i never miss home talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each in turn nor counted strange when i look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this
alas i have grieved so i am hard to love
oe the thy hart wide and fold within the wet wings of thy doth
cood it mean two last a love set handles between sorrow in sorrow
nay i rather thrilled distrusting everyone white that seemed to gi the onward path and fear to over lean a finger even
and though i have grown serene and strong since then i think that got his will a still rena fear
oh love oh troughs
and love be faults
if he to keep one oath must lose one joy by his life's star fort
slow to world greetings quick with its o list when the angel speaks
a ring of amethyst i could not wear here plainer to my side then that first kiss
that was the chrism of love which loves owned crown with sink to finde sweetness did proceeded the third upon my wits was folded down in perfect purple stay since when indeed i have been proud and said my love my owne
dearest teach me so to poor out gratitude as thou gust good
mus elman's and guyers though courts at a smile and half no ruth for any weeping
but thou art not such a lover my beloved
thou canst wait through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch and think it soon w others cry too le
i thinks all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine
oh to shoot my souls ful meaning into future ears that they should lend it utterance and salute love that endure from life that disappears
then i long tried by natural lals received the comfort fast while budding at thy sight my pilgrims staff gave out green lease with morning des impel
i love bee freely as men strive for right i love bee purely as they turned from preys
i love thee with the passion p to use in my old breeks in with my childhood's faith
i love the with a love i seemed to loon with my lost saints i loved the with the breath smile tears of all my life's his i show but love thee better
