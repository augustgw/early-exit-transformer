test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then it was sudden amid day the sun shot of hot and still no bot of air stirred the sky was like blue steal the earth steam
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where was the use of imagining
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the lug had been level with the did' to of week ago and now
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he started at the thought he hurried fore sadly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he splashed to step the law farther and farther onward until he near the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then he looked down the look room was dry
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of all of green f tall wet and willowy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the squares of cotton sharped edge heavy were just about to verse to bows
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for one long moment he paused stupid a gate with utter amazement then leaned dizzily against a tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he gazed about with flexed astonished
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite worken pain some one had dot can now from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and cooked of way thus allowing it to empty directly
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was up a most sola
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the years of the days of her dinging or ten
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: up in the sicker rooms or a lay on the little white bed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then met and well of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled and dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that stroll for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weekly she opened her eyes and questioned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at son e bird and tree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she rose with a fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forward wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she had been borne within its borders within as bor as she had lived and groaned and within its borders she had met her love
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island low the cotton lay before her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the chair was empty when he knew
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he darted through the trees and caused a tall man strongly but slimily made

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at the edge of the s box their lies a great wooden all which so far as mutilation is concerned theres a strong resemblance to the finest breeks sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the austrey of the house is plain no
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beams and making sparkles amongst the wet straws and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cow shed and turning even in the money water that this hurrying along the channel to the drain into am mirror for the yellow build ducks who are seizing the a opportunity of getting a drink with su much body in it as possible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: were the great barn doors are thrown wide open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendents of mister goby the wid of otherwise saddler who entertains them with a latest treadles and gossip
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hetty soul often took the opportunity when her ant's back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished services for the oaken tablet was usually turned up like a scream and was more for ornament than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round peter dishes there were ranged on the shelves above the longbill dinner table or in the hobbs of the great which always shown like jasper
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: do not suppose however that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish and her appearance she was a good looking woman not more than ate in thirty a fair complexion and sandy hair well shapen like footed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the vainly likeness between her and hern niece danaus with a contrast between her keenness and dynes sur rice gentleness of expression might have serve the peter as an excellent suggestions for a martha and mary
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: her tongue was not less king than her eye and whenever a dame sol came with the ar shot seemed to take up an unfinished look sure as a barrel organ takes up a tune precisely at the point where it had left off
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the wood was and why consequently missus poyser should scold molly the housemaid with unusual severity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: d alle appearance molly had gott through her afterward in her work in an exemplary manner had cleans herself with great dispatch and now came to ask submissively if she should sit down to her spinning till milking time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: spitting indeed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i never new your equals for gallows ness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: who taught you to scribe a floor i should like to know
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: come the wolf for that w us indeed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's she'd like to be doings it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's the ways with you that's the road you'd all like to go had longs to ruin
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister's indeed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you are awar and pre sitting down to your work a little while after its time to put by
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: money my irons tripe told these put it down to warm
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: cold is it my darling bless your sweet face
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she's going to put the ironing things away
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: money i did lie to do into the barn and to tom me to see the wid odd
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no no no tully of did her feet wet said missus poyser carrying away her iron
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: did ever anybody's see the like screamed to missus poyser running towards the table when her i had fallen on the blue stream
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: paddy however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run and an amount of fat on the nap of herne which made her looked like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pigg
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and she was very found of you two lant rachel

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for if is anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh sir said missus poyser rather alarmed you wouldn't like it at all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but you she know more about that than i you sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i think i she'd be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i knows farm is in better order than any other with ten miles of us and asked for the kitchen he added smiling i don't believe there's w in the kingdom to beat it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: by the by i never see your dairy am a sere dairy missus poyser
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this missus poyser said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her note pans and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh i've no doubt its and capital order
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the paris plan like that at the crystal palace was a temporary exhibit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the london flat was less temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings and the vicinity of holborn by the
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there mess year's johnson and hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art an secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just m been told
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the dam electric machine tho small was robust four under all the very in speeds of water power and the necessities of the plant to which it the longed it continued in active us until eighteen ninety mine seventeen years
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers addison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: whys if we erect station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up through the city
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there seems no good reason for believing that it were change
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: broad as the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them he is idiosyncrasy oppose to lose and wasteful methods the plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: everything he has done has been aimed that the conservation of energy the contractions of space the intensification of culture
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: for saw years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it could not be used for elector plating or deposition nor could it charge stage batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but one it came to be a questions of lighting u scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a far mouse the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and is ideal
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: bedizen was in intolerant of sham and shoddy and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by like crisco test tube and gallon o
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly government regulated than those available for his dio and lamp addison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give us steady light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister edison was a leader far ahead of the time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he obtained the desired speeded and lord but a friction break also regulator speed but waited for an indicated to verified it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then again thereas was no known way two lubricate an engine for continuous running and mis jades in formed me that as a marne engines started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine for his his purposes mus produced light at all times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: addison had in stalled his his stork first great central station system the new york on the multiple arch system covered by his feeder and maine invention which resulted in unable saving in the cost of conductors as against the straight t w system throughout out of the tree kind
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he soon for sawing that still greater economy would be necessary fore commercial success not alone for the larger cheerily opening but for the compact district of large cities
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the strong position held by the ed sen system under the strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wi assistant and had gave an immediate impidence to incessant lighting
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it wast specially suited for a trial plan also in the early days when a yielded six or eight lamps to the horse power was consider subject for congratulation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the street conductors were of the overhead hole line construction adoring stalled by the construction in company that had been organized by edison to build and equip central stations
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three whar system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor johns hopkinson and mister edison being independent in vents at practically the same time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i thinking was perhaps more appreciative than i was of the discipline of the edison construction department and fought it would be well for us to wait until the morning the fourth before we started th
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but the plant ran and it was the first three wire stationed in this country
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they were later years as reserved machines on finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection live at asia but they remained in practically as good conditions as when installed in eighteen eighty three
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the arc lamp and stalled outside a customs premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate four hours when the lamp might be out through res of it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: et soon held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gasp or water any proceeded to develop a meter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was infinite skepticism around him on the subjects and while other inventors were also giving the subject bere thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or wig and only gave secondary evidence of itself that the exact pointed use could not be brought to accurate registration
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: hence the attis and electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the principle employed in the attis and electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to dee impose a chemical substance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: associated with the simple forms of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tempering as would permit theft of current or damage
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the standard edison neither practice was to remove the selves once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another sat being substituted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in december eighteen eighty eight mister wu j jenks red an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practically experience had up to that time with the meter than more generally in use than any other
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the others having been an operation too short at time to show definite results although they also w quickly to a divide and basis
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this connections it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effects that the edison meet was occurred and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station semen current by meter
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he wait and re away the meter plates and pursued everye investigation imaginable but all in vain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he felt he was up against it and it perhaps other kind of a job would soon him better
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the problem was soled
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we had meters in which they were two bottles of liquid
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: here she would stay comforted en so among the lovely plans and rich exotics rejoicingly hard of old turn at the gardener who since polly's first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: every chance she could steel after practis hours were over and after the clamorous the mans of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then dear said missus whitney you must be kind to to he than ever thinks what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friend's
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear at no longer

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh she's always at p piano said mane she must be there now' somewhere and then somebody laughed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at this the bundle open suddenly and out popped phronsie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but polly couldn't speaking and had jasper hadn't caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool dons and all
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: asked phronsie with her little face close the polly's own
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: now' stay cried man say polly wold you

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i know gasped polly controlling her sobs i won't only i can't think youre
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: asked phronsie in intense interest slipping down of polly's arms and crowding up close to dresser side
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truly phronsie
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh knowledge ser i must go by my very own self
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there jap you've cot it laughed percy while the others screamed at a side of jasper s face
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: don't mind it polly whispered jasper pleas n't her fault
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: dear me ejaculated the old gentlemen and the utmost amazement and such a time as i've had to get her here too
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how it her mother ever l her go
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: she asked impulsively i didn't believe you could persuade her father
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i didn't ha man any fears if i work to rightly said the old gentleman complacently
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he cried in high dudgeon just as if he owned a whole at the fevers and could dispose at them all to suit his fancy
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits at laughter that occupied quite a s face a time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: at last he came out of them and white his face vigorously
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is sixteen years sent john books and died
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his wife now eyes beside him and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the nor region brave yard one looks out over a vast checker board marked offing squares of wheat and corns light and dark dark and light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the graveyards gate one can count the dozen gaily painted farmhouses the gilded weather veins on the big red bonds winked at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the air and the earth the curiously mated and intermingled as if be one with a breaths of the other
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that's not much of a job for an athlete here i've been to town and back

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they think your proud because you've been away to school or something
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there was something in did you of about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on either side of the road for a mile before y reached the foot of the hill stood tall o sage oar and cadges their glossy green mocking off the yellow fields
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: any one d about would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandre burgs and
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is evening a white through of feet hives in the orchards under the walnut trees
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: frank red english spill and the more he read about mister boy's case the angrier he
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mur sighed
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a b s quinn had come up and was driving puppy white clouds across the sky
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that invitation decided her
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i'll but i'm glad to get this place mode
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: just smell the wild roses they are always so spicy after a rain
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we another had s many up them in hair before

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pale and he began to swing his side with that long even stroke that view american boys sever learned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: very pick cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering ranch after matter shivering when she thought a shower of rain drop on her neck and hair
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and aim meal moee his way slowly down towards the cherry trees
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that summer the reins had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than chauta and his man could do kep up with the corse the orchard was an neglected wilderness
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i don't know all of them but i no b nance are
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if i feel that way ideal that way
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he reached up amongst the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit long ivor coloured berries tipped with mint pink like white carl but fall to the ground unheeded all summer through

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he called the sea a prawn at longed the wag taking a little sail
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: therefore don't talk me about views and prospects
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i take this is my answer and i leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sunday august sixteenth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: nothing knew whether unchanged the wind freshens
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but there's seen no reason a fear
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the shadow of the wat was clearly outline upon the surface of the waves
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: truly the sea is of infinite wit
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it lust be as wide as a mediterranean or the atlantic and one right
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: these thoughts agitated me all day in my imagination scarcely calm down after several outsleep
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i shudder as i recall these monstrous to my remembrance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i sawed the hammer muse the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i suppose professor leading brack was of my opinion too and even shared my fears after having examined the pick his eyes traversed the ocean from side the side
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: tuesday august eighteenth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: daring his watch i slim
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: two hours afterwards a terrible shock of lo me
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the raft was heated up on a watry mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there's a wale awa cried the professor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: flight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they willed around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of expressed trains
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: two monster's only retreating all this commotion and before my eyes are too reptiles of the primitive world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can distinguish the eye of it the assist glowing like a red hot cove and as large as a man's head
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: its jaws enormous and according naturalist is ad with no less than one hundred and eighty two teeth
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: those huge creatures attack each other with a greatest animosity
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: suddenly the it dia assist and the planty source disappear below leaving war pole eddying in the water
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as for that if the as source as he returned to suma in cavern
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the wings become lost in the distance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the weather if we may use the ter will change before law
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the atmospheres charge with vapors provided with the at triced generated by the evaporation of sailing waters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the electric light con scarcely penetrate to the dance curtain which is dropped over the theatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the air as is heavy the sea is calm
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from time to time a fleecy tuft of mins we yet some gaming light left upon it pros down upon the dense fu of grey and loses itself in the oa and impenetrable mass

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the mother as soon as the chase iss so far turned that marry can no longer watch the expression of her confidence goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and sis faction on her face at the ingenuity an su excess of her little artifice
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but well stay at home contentedly won't you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the mother managing the case in this way realised partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if you should not be a good girl what should show sides of making us any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house untill we are gone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been habitually managed on miss principle she will not make any trouble
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is indeed true that the importance of tacked and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection cannot be overrated

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in the early morning of the next day may twenty nine accompany of dragons with one empty saddle came down from the fort and while the pros labor men still slept the prisoner and his escort were on their way across the prairies to accompli in the charge of officers of the united states army
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: though throwing to prison for this enterprise and detained some time he was not discouraged but still continued by his countenance and protection to infused spirit into the distressed royalists
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: among other press ins of distinction who united themselves to him was the lord may par of marc stan some of the famous inventor of the lery shon to whom the title of a great man is more justly de than to any other whom his country ever produced
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: while former f told that the scottish caven e tars were secretly forming a union with the english parliament them inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking latter still insisted that every such at tempt with precipitate them into measures to which otherwise they were not perhaps inclining
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the king's ears were now opened to mont roses councils who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cals and scotland
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: five hundred men more who had been levied by the cover enters were persuaded to embrace the royal calos and w this combined force he hastened to attack lord elk who lay it parfit with an army of six thousands men assembled upon the first years of the irish invasions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: dreading the superior power of our dle who having joined his vassals to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerable army montes hastened northwards in order to rouse again the mock of hope the u the gordons who havings before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the covers
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: miss nobleman's character though celebrated for political courage and conducted was very lo for military prowess after some skirmishes in which he was worsted he here aloud montrose to escape him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i quick marches through these inaccessible mountains that general freed himself from the superior forces of the governors
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: with these and some reenforcements of the ethel men and boo olds whom he had recoil montes fou suddenly upon our giles country and let loose upon it all the rage of war carrying off the cattle burning their houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this severity by which montes sued his victories was the results of private animosity against the chieftain as much as of zeal for the public cause agile collecting three thousand men marched in question the enemy who had retired with their plunder than he lay at inner lucky supposing himself still at a considerable distance from them
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my a quick and unexpected march m trots hastened to inner lucky and presented himself an order of battle before the surprised but not af frightened cover enters
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his conduct and presence of mind in the se emergence appeared conspicuous
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: montrose weak in cavalry here lined his troops of horse with infantry and after putting the enemies horse to rout fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cuts in pieces th with the loss of the gallant lord gorden on the part of the royalists
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: from the same men newe regiments and newe companies were formed different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands asked the independence could rely on
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: besides members of parliament who were excluded many officers unwilling to serve under the newe generals threw up their commissions but done warily facilitated the projects of putting me army and tore into the hands of that faction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that the discipline of the former plenty army was not contemptible a more exact plan was introduced than rigorously executed by these new commanders
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: valor indeed was very generally diffused over the one party as well as the other during this period discipline also was attained by the forces of the parliament but the perfections of the military art in concerting the general plans of actions and the operations of the field scenes still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: historians at least perhaps from their owne ignorance and inexperience have not remarked an thing but headlong impetuous pollux each party hurrying two battle were valor and fortune chiefly determine the success
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: he passed through henry see albans and came so nears london as harrow on the hill
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the spotty should generals and commission as affected great surprise on the appearance of the king and though they paid him on the exterior respected due to his dignity they instantly sit a guard upon him under color of protection and made him in reality a prisoner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they informed the english parliament of this unexpected incident and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: or have he given us any gift
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and the men of is ryle outs the men of judah and said we have ten parts in king and we have also of more right in david than y why then did g despise us that hurd vice should not be first had in br back our king
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: another preacher off reproaching him to his face with his mis government ordered this song to be some
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the king was stood up and cold for that song which begins with these words
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: have nursy lord c le i pry for men would me devour
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the good natured ordinance in pity to full and majesty showed for on scite or difference to the king than to the minister and some the sal which the former had cold for
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the parliament and the scots laid their proposes before the king
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: before the settlement of terms the administration must be possessed en toy by the pons of both kingdoms and how incompatible that scheme with the liberty of the king is easily imagined
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the english it is evident had they not being previously issued of receiving the king would never have parted with so considerable some and while they weakened themselves by the sing measure have strength and de people with whom they must of to ones have so material and interest to discuss
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if any still retaining rank against him in his present condition they passed in silence while his well wishers more generous than prudent accompanied his march with tears with that pam nations than with prayers for his safety
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: his deaths in this conjuncture was a public misfortune
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the analysis of knowledge will were occupies until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficulty part of our whole enterprise
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what is called perception difference from sensation by the facts that the sensational andre hands bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual courts all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: whether not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly my seem it overstatement and it my seem more corrects to say that i does approximately represent impressions
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: and what sort of evidence is logically possible
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is no logical impossibility and the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it there was with the population that remembered a wholly unreal past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: all that i dinging is to use its logical ta ability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the the horus to attempts to make psychology e record of behavior has to trust his memory in making the record
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the the haig rest fills confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but i do not thinks such an inference is warranted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself sinse we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a france face vividly and clearly but poorly distorted
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some images like some sensations fill very familiar while others full strange
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: familiarity as a filling capable of degree
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel mor familiar than others when dis happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the flinging of greater or less remoteness in some remembered if that
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of pastes especially where immediate memory is concerned
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such fillings must play an essential part in the process of dating remember advance
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: if we had retained the subjects or acte in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or later to what is remembered
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: some points may be taken as as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive out at
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in this case as a most others what may be taken a certain and advance is rather they
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the first of our vague good but indubitable data set there is knowledge of the past
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we might provisionally that perhaps not quite correctly to fine memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serves to mark the problems with which we are concerned those some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediate sey
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this distinction is vile to understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draws in theory
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from grandi pens as they like to believe
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can sit to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the fact that a man can recite the poem does not show to he remembers any previous occasions on which he has recited or read it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: simmons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: they give walls according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our believe for these image is refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is this that is a vent interest to theory a knowledge
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is by no means always were liable almost everybody has at som time experienced the well known illusion that all that has happening now happened before at some time
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite obstinate it res us to search the environment until we are satisfy that we have found the appropriate objects which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: a further stage is recognition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more that a habit of association the kind of objects we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize and objects that we have seen it before but this judgment is as something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this knowledge is memory and once sense though another it is not
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to again with it might seen at first sight more corrected to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the definition of my experience is difficulty broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory ar among the most important
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thus if i recognize the thing the occasion of its previous existence and virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition the recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is single out from the rest of the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form ad judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level thought which is by no m means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as it recognition
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter and another light
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: had either cress weller not been good looking had jack and still a college had sir k anton oo remained in england i mister bonnet and the barkeeper not succeeded and stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in a ring for the final the pure of my old friend
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: on arriving at home and my own residence i shown that marshall alarm was filled with a brilliant company
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mode of address that i did not bear any grudge asked to my individual self
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i have come to your shores mister president with the purpose of seeing how things of progressing in this distant quarter of the world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we have our little struggles yere as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rose wor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we are quite satisfied now captain battle axe said my wife
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: quite satisfied said either
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: the ladies in compliance with that softness of hard which is their characteristic or on one side and the men by whom the world pas th rely managed or on the other
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: no doubt in process of time the ladies will follow
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: their masters said missus never b
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i did not mean said captain b ages the toucht upon public subjects at such a moment has this
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: missus never b you mustn't indeed be proud of your son
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: jack had been standing in the four corner of the room talking too either and was now reduced the silenced by his praises
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: sir kennington oval is a very fine player said my wife
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i a my wife and sung and the two press wells and three ye or four others agreed to dine eh the ship on the next
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this i felt was pay to me as being president other republic and i endeavoured to behave myself such mingled humility and dignity as might be fit the occasion but i couldn a feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my winny life
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: my wife on the spur the moment managed to give the gentlemen a very good dinner
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: this she said was true hospitality but i am not sure id did not agree with there
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then never three y or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: oh yes s said jack and i'm nowhere
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but i mean to have my innings before long
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: of what missus never ben had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and gales for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished tasks with thorough success
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: we sat with the officers some little time after dinner and then went ashore
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: how much of evil of reel accomplished evil had there not occur to be during the last few days
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well cow do now but just lay him myself down and die
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: in a death of which i drip could not alas
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: when this captains should have taken himself and as vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the furthest side of the island and m seclusions what i end my days
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: jack would become e as happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: thinking of all this i went to slep
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: mister never ben began a captain and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president there cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you have received us with all that courses and hospitality for which your characters in england stands so high
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: it is a duty said i
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but your power iss so su appeared to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: not a del but had your force been only double or trouble our own i should have found at my duty to struggle with you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: that is all quite true mister never ben said sir ferdinand brown
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can afford to smile because i am absently parlous before you but i do the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the worlds concerned i or rather we have been put downs by brute force
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have had been on boor
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: then said sir fernando there's nothing for it but that we must take you with him
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you hear what sir fer men oll brown a sad replied captain battle axe
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: but one a de delicate mission i asked
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: i was to be taken away and carried to england were elsewhere or j around upon the voyage and mattered not which

test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you may be quite shorts there said captain battle axe and that i can so use it as to half a b literate your town within two minutes of my return on borg
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you proposed to kid not me i said
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: well we become of your gun where i to cannot you
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: lieutenant crosstrees is a very gallant offers sir
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: one of us always remains on board while the others u sure
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: what world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crush them both by my words had it been possible my dislike centered itself on sir fer and mow
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: you'll allow me to suggest said he but that is a matter of opinion
test-clean BEAM_OUT_1: where i to comply with your orders with that expressing my own opinion i shall seem to have done so willingly hereafter
