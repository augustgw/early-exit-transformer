how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became everyday more brilliant and the intelligence that through its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
gods as a directed consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonored bosom to connected her parent f ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
yet these thoughts affected hester print less with hope than apprehensions
the child had a native grace which does not invariably co exist with bot less beauty it's attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were a very garb that precisely became it bestest
this outward mobility indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inter life
hester could only account for the child's characters and even then most magi end imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that moment dis period while pearl was imbibing her soul for from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earths
they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's dispositions but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolifick of the storm and whirlwind
hester print nevertheless the loving mother' of this one child ran little risk of airing on the side of undo severity
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge
as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that rolled the moment
it was a look so intelligent yet it explicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that hester couldn not have questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human child
beholding it heer was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little alp in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much r from overflowing love as to ashore herself that pearl was fleshing blood and not utterly delusive
brooding over all these matters the mother' felt like one who h a bo the spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjurations has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world
pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance

heer print went one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be warned on some great occasion of state bore though the chances of a popular elections had caused this former ruler to descend a stepper too from the highest rank he still held and honourable and influential place among the colonial magistracy
another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek and interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
at that ef of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter publick interests and a far less intrinsic wit than the welfare of hester er child were strangely mixed up with a deliberations of legislators and acts of state
the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only cause a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modifications of the frame work itself of the legislature

the mother herself as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorch into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its forme had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of more bid ingenuity to create an analogy between the objects of her affections and the emblem of her guilt and torture
but in truth pearl was the one as well as the others and only and consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scar at letter in her appearance
come therefore and let us spling m at them
but pearl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the not of her enemies and put them all to flight
she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless cause the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them

no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so so far into the thick forest while they were gone

he knew it would take them too the house of the crooked at magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbour
all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unc in ojo sat on the fallen tre trunk and at the last of the bread which the old munchkin had pled in his pocket

it takes me several years to make this magic powder pin at this moment i am pleased to say is nearly done you see im making it for my goodwife margare lot who once to you some of it for a purpose of her own

yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose
a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and colors of claw on neatly so together
sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up
when i founded it i said to myself that he would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proude nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colours would discourage her from tinge to be dignified as the blue munchkins
at the emerald city where our princess os m lives green is the popular colour
i will show you what a good job i did and she went to it tall covered and through open the doors
ojo examined this curious contrivance with wonder
maraud had first made the girls formed fromage quilted and then she had dressed it with the patch works skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same game material throughout out
the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her
the hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat braids
gold is the most common medal in the land of os and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable

shep poured into the dish quantity from each of these bottles
i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in the servant
she ran to her husband side at once and helped him lift the four cals from the fire
their contents had all boiled away leaving in the bottom of each cattle a few grains of fine white powder
very carefully the magian removed this powder placing it altogether in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon
no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
ojo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
he selected a small gold bottle with the pepper box top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any objects through the small holes

but the beare instead of obeying maintained of the seated had taken and growled
the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the h he received they must stand further off
then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his positions and slowly entered the place
it was silent and gloomy being ten sole by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
lon just occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bounded both hands and feet by strong and painful wits
the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and the singers as good as nothing
the delawares are children of the tots and they outstrip the dear
uncas who had already approached the door and readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
but hark i who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himselfe into his companions
so incas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust cunning for want of speeded
well what can't be done by main encourage and war must be done by circumvention
as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions
my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy in love returned david a little n ho that so directed and attack on his manhoode but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord evening in the greatest straits
if you are were not then knocked on the head your being annon composer will protective and you'll then have a good reason tod expect to dieing in your bed
su chuse for yourself to make a rush or tarry here
bravely and generously as he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in hiss service
kep silent as longest made be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
ifs however they take scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for conditions he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practice myself as one without across a blooded though it does not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
god bless you friend i do believe your sent has not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural of gifts in the force of temptations
the delaware dogs he said leaning forward and peering through the dim like to catch the expressions of the others features is he afraid
with the hers here his groans
the mo he can started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counter fitted was about to make some desperate effort
he had no occasion to delay fret next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
mc as cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would served to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitations that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
without his scrapbooks his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an in comfortable man
i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correction
i was absent rather more than an hour
the only duplicate which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion
the moment i looked at my tablet i was aware that someone had raged among my papers
the proof was in three longed slips i had left them all together
the etna was that someone passing observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
i gave him a little brandy left him collapsed in a char will im meade a most carefully sish of the room
a broken tip of lad was lying there also
not only this but on the tablet i found a small ball of black dull or clay with spects of something which looked like sawdust in it
above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
to the best of my belief they were rolled out up
did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
i was in such a hurry to come toy you you left you door open
so it seems to me
now mister salons at your sposa
above her three students one each story
then here approached it and standing on tipt with his n crain he looked into the room
there is no opening except the one paining said our learned guide
i am afraid there are no signs here said he
one could hardly hope for any upon so dry day
you left him in a chair you say which chair by the windowed there
the man entered and took the papers she by sheet from the central tablet
as a matter of fact he could not sums for i entered by the side door
along with a taken to do that using every possible contraction the quarter an hour not less
then he tossed it down and seized the next
he was in the midst of that when your returned caused him to make a very hurried retreat veryain hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been
mister psalms was someone overwhelmed by this fl of informations
comes held out a smalls chip with the letters and in and the space of clear wood
watson i have always done you and injustice there are others
i was hoping that if the paper i which he wrote was thin some traced it might come through upon this polished surface n i see nothing
as hommes d the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and in larn of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
hm turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor hallo it is this
homes h out on his open palm in the glare of the elector light
what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
i understanding to say that there are three students to use this stair and are the habit of passing your door yes there are
and they are all in for examinations yes
one hotly likes to throw suspicions whet there are no proofs
let us the suspicions i will look after the proofs
my scholar has been left a very revery poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
the top floor belongs to mesa c learn
i donn not go su so far as that but of the three he has perhaps the least unlikely
he was still suffering from from the sudden disturbance of the quiet retain of his life
by have occasionally thon the same thing at other times
did you look at these papers on the tablet
how came you to leave the key in the door
anyone the room could get out yes sir
i really don't think heee much aboute at mister homes
only f for a minute are so
oh i wouldn not venture to say sir
you haven't seen any of them no sir
it was the indian whose dark sad appeared suddenly upon his blind
he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
the set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
no name's please said homes as we knocked g christo
of course he did not realize that it was e who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances rather suspicious
that is veryain importance at homes
you don't seem to realize the positions
t morrow was the examinations
i cannot be allow the examinations to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situations must be faced
it is possible that i may be an a position then too indicate some course of actions
i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings good by
when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
the fou mouse fellow at the top
hes the one with the worst record
why banister the servant whats his game in the matter
he impressed me as being a perfectly honest men
my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders and half humorous resignations
no goods my dear watson
i think so you have formed conclusion
yes my dear watson i have so the mystery
look at that he held ab out his hand
on the palm three little pyramids of black do clay
and one more this morning
in a few hours the examinations would commence and he was still in the delaid between making the facts public and allowing the culpable s cols ship
he could hardly stand stills so great was his mental agitations and he ran towards holes with two eager hands outstretched think heaven that you have come
you know him i think so
if this matter is not to become publick we must give ourself certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial
no sir certainly not
there was no mans sir
his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon bannister in the farther corner
just close the door said homes
we want to know mister gil christ how you and honorable man ever came to commit such an actions that of yesterday'
for a moment gil christ with upraised hands tried to control his riving features
come come said said homes kindly it is human to air and at least no one can accuse you being a cals criminal
well well don't trouble to answer listen and see that i do you know injustice
he could examine the papers in his ow office
the indian i also thought nothing of
when i approached your room i examine the windowed
no one less than that would have a chance
i entered and i took you into my confidence to this suggestions of the side tablet
he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are weare with several sharps spikes
no harm would have been done had it not been that he pass your door he perceived the key which hadn been left by the carelessness of your servant
a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
he put his shoes on the tablet
gloves saide the young man
suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
h i told the truth mister go christ
i have a letter here mister sols which i wrote to you ely this morning in the middle of a restless night
it would be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since she were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out
it was simple enough sir if you only had known but without your cleverness it was impossible you couldn know
if misters soul saw then them the game was up
in the debate between the signor societies her defense of the fifteenth moment had been not only notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
the south she had not thought of seriously in yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate shee was not verse to charleston or newland's
john tao who had supported her thwough college was interested in cotton
better girl he had council sententiously
might learned something useful down there
but john is no society just elementary work
then looking up toes county
some curs wells there b plantations rad two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
some others too big cotton county
you ought to know john if i teach negros ell scarcely see much of people in my own glass
at any rate i say go
here she was teaching dirty childrens and the smell of confused orders and bodily p aspirations was to her times un babble
she wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great vil thro piece in reforms
sop for the hundred time she was thinking too day as she walked alone up the laying back of the barn and then slowly downed through the bottoms
cut she posed
she had almost forgotten that it was here within touch in sight
the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her stretching away to the northward
it m be a bit of port here and there but most of place was such desperate pros
her regards shifted to the green stocks and leaves again and she started to move away
cotton is a wonderful thing is in not voice she said rather primly
miss tailor did that know much aboute cotton but at least one more remarked seem called four
don't know will of all things in would re commented miss tailor lit ary born and cotton and o well as much as to asks the use she turned again to go
i suppose go its too early for them then came the explosion
good was don't grow on the tops vans but on the ground on the rots l cams is he so
the golden fleece it's the silver fleas hearkened
sim you term o please won't you
now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even that she had been talking just talking there were no persons in the conversations just things one thing cotton
the honourable child smiths missa's brother was walking swiftly up town for from mister easter le's wall street office and his face was pale
at last the cotton combine was to all appearances in assured facts and he was slated for the sin it
why should he not be as other men
she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to herr like intelligence in others
as she awaited her guest serve the tablet with both satisfaction and is quiet for her social functions were few to night there were she check them off on her fingers sir james cried the rich english manufacturer and lady cit and mister missus banda pool mister harry cress well in hiss sister john tailor and his his sister and mister charles smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be you d dis senator from new jersey a selection of guests had been determine unknowns to the hostess by the meeting of coon interest earlier in the day
missus grey had met suns before but not intimately and she always had in m vividly their cruelty to poor negros a subject she made a point of introducing fork with
she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister cress well express himself so cordially as approving of negro educational
do believe in some educational asked mary tailor
i believe in the train in of people to the has capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
but cress well added significantly capacity differs in no mos l between races
the bandon pools were sure this and the englishman instant singing india became quite eloquent missus grey was mystify but hardly dared amid it the general trend of the conversations seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharper scrutiny before being loud much educational and as forth the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
positive the hick added cress well avoiding hiss sister's eyes
but we nother exactly welcome
mary tao however related the tale of absorb to missus grace private ear later
fortunately said mister v ful northers in sobs all roving better mutual understanding on most of these matters
he knew the silver flees parsons as must be ruined
it was the first great sorrow his life it was not so much the loss of the carton itself but the fantasy the hopes the dreams built a rounded
ah the swamp the cools swam
the revelations of his love lighted and brightened slowly to it flinging like a sun rise over him and left him and burning wonder
he panted to know ifs she too new or new and cared not or cared and knew not
she was so strange in human creature
the world was water veiled in mists
then of a sudden that midday the sun shot out hot and stills nob worth of air stirred the sky was like lose steel of the earth steam
where was the use of imagining
the lag had been level with the des awe togo and now
perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly
he splashed to stem long farther and farther onward until he near the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
then he looked down the lagoon was dry
he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of all of green they tall wet and willowy
the squares of cotton sharp edged cavy were just about to burst to bowls
for one longed moment he passed stupid a gate with utter amazement then ling dis against the tree
he gazed about re flexed astonished
here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite working pains someone had dug can now from the l leg to the creek into which the former had drained by longing and cook it way thus allowing it to empty directly
he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost so
the years of the days of her ding were ten
the hope and dream of harvest was upon the lands
up in the sick rooms or a lay on the little white bed
the ned and web ab endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that stroll for her life with knowed in creeping fingers but now at last weakly she open her eyes and questioned
for while shell lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at son and bird and tree
she rose with the fleeting glance gathered the shawl rounder then gliding forwards wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
she had been born within its porters within his bo she had lived and grown and with in its border shed met her love
on she hurried until sweeping down to the lag and the island lo the cotton lay before her
the cha was empty when he knew
he darted through the trees and pasted a tall man strongly but slimily made
it is a very revery fin old place of redd brick softened by appeal powdery liken which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bringing the redd brick into terms of friendly con companionship with the lin stone ornaments surrounding the three gables the windows and the door place
but the windows are patched with wooden pains and the door i think is like the gate it is never opened
for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shedding with a sonorous bang behinde the liber lackey who had just seen his master and m misters off the grounds in a carriage and pare
a large open fire place with rusty dogs in it and a barer boarded floor at the far end fleeces of w stacked up in the middle of the floor some empty corned bags
and what through the left hand windows
several clots horses a pillion a spinning wheel in an old box white open and stuff full of coloured rights
at the edge of the s box their lies a great wooden doll which so bars mutations concern bears a stronger resemblance to the finest s greek sculptor and especially in the total loss of its nose
the history of the house is plain now
but there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant afternoon he is pouring down his beams in making sparkles among the wet straw and lighting up everye patch of vivid green moss and the red tiles of the couched and turning even the mod water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for yellow build ducks are seizing the opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it is possible
were the great barn doors are thrown white open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendence of mister goby the wow otherwise saddler who entertains them with a latest treadles and gossip
hey sor often took the opportunity when an back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflections of herself in those polished services for the oak tablet was usually turned up like a screen and was more for ornament than for use and she could see you herself sometimes in the great round put dishes there were a ranged on the shelves above the longed deal diner tablet in thebes of the great which always shone like jasper
do not suppose however that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish and her appearance she was a goodlooking women not more than eight in thirty a fair complexions and sandy here well shapen lightfooted
the vainly like between her and her knees din more with the contrasts between her keenness and dinas sirrah gentleness of expressions might have served the painter as an excellent suggestions for a martha in mary
her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a damsel came with air shot seemed to take up an unfinished lure as a barrel organ take sub tune precisely at the point where it had left off
the fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the wows and why consequently missus poyser should scold molly the housemaid with unusual severity
towel appearance molly had got through her afterwards exemplary manner had cleaned herself with great despatch and now came to as submissively if she should sit down to her spinning till ming time
spinning indeedy
i never knew your equals for galls ness
who t you describe floor i should like to know
come the wall for the wows indeedy
that's were you'd like toy dinging is it
that's away with you that's the road you all like to go he longs to ruin
mister o lees indeed
you are a rein for sitting down he work a little while after its time to put by
money my and strike told these put it down to warm
cold as it my darling blesses your sweete face
she's going to put the ironing things away
money i did like to do into the barn to tim me to see the wad
no no no ty had get her feet wet said missus poyser carrying away her iron
did ever anybody see the like screamed missus poyser running towards the tablet when her ey had fallen on the blue stream
tidy however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the deary with a sort of wadding run and in amount of fat on the neap of her neck which made her look like the metamorphoses of a white suckling pigg
and she was rey found of view two a rachel
i often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way
when he had that ban illness and i was only eleven years old she used to say you'll have a friend on earth in your aunt rachel if i'm taken from for you for she has a kind heart and i'm sure i've found it so
and there's linen in the house as i could well spare you for i got lots a sheeting and tablecloth in twinges isn't mad up
but not more than whats in the babble end said dinah
mad dear and you never'd me say that all people are call to forsake their work in their families
we can all be servants of god were ever our lot is cast but he gives us different sorts of work accordingly he fits us for it and cuss to it
i can no more helped spending my life and trying to do what i can for the souls of others then you could help running if you heard little ty crying at the other into the house the voice would go to your heart you would think the dear child was in trouble in danger and you couldn't rest without running to helper and comfort her
i've strong assurance that no evil will happed you in my uncle in the childrens for anything i have done
i didn't peach without directions

by this time the two gentleman had reached the pilings and had got down from their horses it was plainly meant to come in
said mister irwine with his stately cordiality
oh ser don mentioned saide his poyser

i must come another day and see your husband i won to have a consultation with him about horses
for if is anywhere on the farm wee can send for him an a minute
oh sir said missus poyser rather alarmed he wouldn't like it at all
but you knew more about that that i doe sir
i think i as should be doing you a service to turn you out of such place
i knows farm is in better order than any other within ten miles of us and as for the kitchen he added smiling i don't believe theres one in the kingdom to beat it
by the bye i never see your dairy it must se your da missus poyser
this missus poyser said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in arme pans and would adjust his opinions of her to the appearance of herder
oh i've no doubts in capital order
the paris plant like that of the crystal palace was a temporary exhibit
the london plant was less temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings in the vicinity of holborn vida
there mess y's johnson in hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told
the dial electric machine tho small was robust for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen nighty nine seventeen years
owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to of the consumers edison has been frequently spoken as an upon it of the alternating current

everything he is done has been aim that the conservation of energy the contractions of space the intensification of culture
for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously
it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could charge storage batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the d
but when it came to be questioned of lighting a scattered sub a group of dwellings on the outskirts amon country residence or a far mouse the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and his ideal
edison was in intolerant of sham and shod and nothing would satisfy him that couldn not stand cross examinations by microscope test tube and galvanometer
unless he could secure and engine of smother running and more exactly governed regulated th those eva be foras dio and lamp edison realize that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady l
mister edison was a leader far ahead of the time
he obtained the desired speeded and load with a friction break also regulator of speeded but waited four an indicator to verified
then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running and mister edison inform me that as amen engine started before the ship left the york and continued running until it reached its home port so and engine forth his purpose is must produce light at all times
edison had install his stork first great central stations system new york on the multi ark system covered by his feet and maine invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against the straight too wire system threw out of the tree kinds
he soon fore saw that still greater economy would be necessary f for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact district of large cities
the strong position held by the edison system under the strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and he gave an immediate emphasis of lighting
it was specially suited for a trial plat also in the early days when yield six or eight lamps to the horse power was consider subject for congratulations
the street conductors were of the overhead pull line construction and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by anson to builded and equip central stations
meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three w system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent invents at practically the same time
i think he was perhaps more appreciative that i was of the discipline of the edison construction to pard and fought it would be well for us to wait until the morning the fourth before we started up
but the plant ran and it was the first three wire stationed in this country
they were later used as reserved machines and finally with the engine retired for from service as part of the collections of at sonia but they remained in practically as goods conditions as one installed in eighteen e ey th

there was infinite skepticism a rounded him on the subjects and while other invents were also giving the subject bethought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or wee and only gave secondary evidence if of itself at the exact pointed use could not be brought to accurate registration
hence the edison electric neet is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
the principle employed in the edison electric met is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose chemical substance
associated with the simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operations freedom from in accuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
the standard edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central stationed company for examinations another sat beings substituted
in december eighteen eighty eight mister due je jenks re interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers al theo six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use then any others
the others having been in operations too short at timed to showed definite results although they also went quickly to a div and basis
in this connections it should be mentioned that the associations of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison meter was a it and that its use was not expensive fore stations above one thousand lights and that the best fatal results were invariably secured in a stations sem curt by meter
the meter continued in generals service during eighteen ninety mind and probably up to the clothes of the century
he weighed and rew the meter plates and pursued every line of investigations imaginable but all in vain
he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
the problem was sorted
we are were more interested in the technical conditions of the stations that in the commercial part
we had neither sin which there were two bottles of liquid
here she would stay comforted soot among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turn of the gardener whose sence polly's first rapturous entrance had taken her into his goode graces for all time
every chance she could steel after practis hours were over and after the clamorous a mans of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
then dear said missus whitney youll must be kindly to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
somehow of all the days when the home feeling with the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear at no longer
ifs she gould only see phronsie for just one moment
oh she's always at the piano said man she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
at this the bundle opened suddenly and out pop phronsie

yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truely pons
oh no chapter i must go by my veryain own self
they jap you've cot it laud percy while the others screamed the side of a jasper's face
don't mind it polly whispered jasper pent her fall
dear me ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost amazement and such a time as i've had to get her here two
hued her mother' ever let her go
she asked impulsively i didn't believe you could persuade her fathers
i didn't ha any fear as if i worked rightly said the old gentleman complacently
he cried and high dagon just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose that them all to sooth his fancy
and the old gentlemen was so delighted with hiss success that he had to burst out int a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time
at last he came out of them and wife his face vigorously
it his sixteen years since john burs and died
his wife now lies beside him and the whit shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields
from from the nor regin graveyard one looks out over a vast jack bard marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light
from from the grave yard gate one can count that does gaily painted farmhouses the yielded weather veins on the big red barns wee g at each others across the green and browns and yellow fields
but air and the earth th curiously mated and intermingle as if the one r the breath of the others
he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow
that's not much of a job for an ale here i've been a town and back

indeedy he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it
they think your are proud because you've been away to school are something
there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail
on either side of the road for a mile before he reached the foot of the hill stood tall o sage oran sheds their glassy green marking off the yellow fields
any one there about would have told you that this was one of her richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra bergs and
there is even a white r of be hips and the orchard under the wall trees

two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me
the raft was heeded up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of tway fathoms

poor alice
it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed the pair white kid gloves in one ha and a large fan in the others he came trotting along and a great hurry muttering to himselfe he came oh the duchess the duchess
oh what she be savage if i've kept her waiting
alice tok up the fan and gloves and as the hall was veryain hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is today
and yesterday thinks w on just usual
i wonder i've been changed in the night
i almost i can remember feeling a little different
i'll try if im know all the things i used to know
i shall never g to twenty at that rate
how cheerfully he seems to grand how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws

itll be no use their putting their heads down and san come up again dere
i'm so veryain tired to being all alone here
and i declare it's too pad that it is
i wish i hadn cried so much said alice as shes swim about trying to find her way out
i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned my own tears
that will be a queer thing to be sure
i am very revery tired to swimming about here o mouse

we won't talk about her any more if he'd rather no we indeedy
we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
the conditions that i will be permitted to make lo her talk american stream wh him so to speak because you will never get people whether in outside the luther in church actually to read luther and must we make him talk as he would talk today to americans
let us begin with that his commons agitations
the undertaking which seemed so attractively viewed as literary task proved the most difficult one and it times became oppressive
it was written in and latin
the word hadad to be convinced
for wor should n be set about the origin of luther's common initiations
much later when a friend of his was preparing in additions of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way aboute its they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my delians for instance and
in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther a dressed stance and the course of glaciers and ro prepared the man scrip for the printer
it presents like no other of luthers writings the central thought of christianity the justifications of the sinner for the sake of chris merits alone
but the essence of luthers lectures is there
the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do loo too

in everywhere they so to undermining authority of seen paul
they said to the relations you have no right to think highly of paul
he was the last to turned christ
poking later in his beneath us
indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
do you suppose that god for the sake of a few mut threats would theon his entire church
against these boasting false apostles boldly defence his apostolic authority and ministry
as the ambassador of a government is honoured for his office and not for his private person so the minister of cric should exult his office in order to gain authority among m
paul t's prim his ministry not to his own phase but to the praise of god
paul and apostle not of men et cetera
either he called ministers to the agency of men or he cost them directly as he called the profits in apostles
pa the clays that the false apostles were call her sent neither by men nor by man
the most they could clime is that they were simple others
he mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by god
because not to be taken lightly
for persona possess knowledge is not enough
is spoils one's best work
when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his c
i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
i knew nothing of the doctrine faith because we re t so facer instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
this is no sinful pride it is holly pride

these perverts of the rightness of christ resist the father the sun and the works of them both
in this whole epistle paul treats of the resurrection of christ
by his resurrection christ one the victory over law son flesh worl devil death hell and every evil
first too
and all the breth roman which are withan me
this should go far and shutting the mouse of the false or poses
although the breadth with me your not apostles like myself yet there all one mind with me think right in teaches id do
they do not go with the enemies of the gospel predominant they go with the questions are

navigation ands had become perverted
these means cannot be continent
they remained divine regardless of men's opinions
wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church even though an into grist reams there
so much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the apostle verse three
grace be too you in peace from from god the fathers and from our lo jesus christ
the terms of grace and peace are common terms with paul in are now pretty well under stooder
the greeting of the apostles refreshing
grace and vs remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
the world brands this of permission doctrine

however the grace in piece of god will
m should not speculate about the nature of god
was it not enough to say from god the fathers
to do so is to lose goot altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek a measure int comprehend is infinite majesty
he came down to earths lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us soir that our hearts and eyes m fasten upon him
embrace him and forget about the nature of god
did not christ himself say i am the way in the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
when you are you about the nature of god apart for from the questions of justifications you may be as profound as you like
we are to hear christ to has been appointed by the fathers as our divine teacher
at the same time pal confirms are creed that christ is very god
that christ is very revery gods apparent in that pul scribes him divine powers equally with the fathers as for instance the power to the spens grace and peace
to bestow piecing grace lies in the province of god who along concrete his blessings the angels cannot
otherwise pul should of written grace from god the fathering peace from lord jesus christ
the carians took cric for a noble in perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created hevening earth

not gold silvers or passion lambs or an angel but himself what fore
not for a crown were kingdom or a goodness before sins
under score these words for there they are full of comfort for sore consciences
how m we obtained remission of over since
pianers the man whose nan jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for since
since christ was given for our sons it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by own efforts
this sentence also to finds our sins as great so great in fact that the whole worlds could not make ams for single son
the greatness of the ransom christ some of god indicates this
the vicious character of sein is brought out by the words who gave himself for sins
but we are careless we make light of sin
we think that by some little worker merit we can dismiss
this passage then theres out the fact that all maner solder sin
this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin as a small matter easily taken care of by good works that we must present oursel them to gob with a good conscience that we must feel no son before may feel that christ was given for our sins
this atitudes is universal in particularly developed in those who consider themselves better of than others
but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
on the other hand we're not to regard them is so terrible that we must despair

the influence which the tus has exercised upon bit is due partly to a misunderstanding
in the suppose depths of the dial the newe platonists found hidden means in connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly corrects in him his efforts realized in connect ostriches was not understood by them at all
the is danger of the modern com teachers on t y falling into theses of neal platonists
in the present day we are well awar that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
the fancies of the new plat mists are only interesting to us because they exhibit of fs of the human mind which pre veiled wily in the first centuries of the christian ear and is not wholly extinct in our o bay
but they have nothing to do with the interpretations of polo and in spit they are oppose to him

the dio is primarily concerned with the animal creations including under dree the heavily bodies and with man only as one among the animals
what he has not as yet the fin this immediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and let mats and he would have felt that there was as great and impiety in winking furies of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul

many if not all the elements of the priest cric philosophy are included in the ten is
it is probable that the relations of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently we conceived by him at different times of his life
the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
the style and plan of the tears different greatly from that of any other of the plutonic dials
but plato has not the same mar over his instrument which he exhibits e the fates or sposi him
nothing in exceeded the beauty were a of introductions in which his using words after his accustomed manner
but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
he could ride in one style but not in another the greek language had not as y been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
and hence we findin the same sort of cosiness in the timers of plato which care rises to plows officer p of l crashes
there is a w of flow and often a defect of rid them the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater us of apposition and more of repetition then occurs and platts earlier wits

but already at pointed in economic evolution far ant dating the emergence of the lady specialized consumption of goods as in evidence of pecuniary strength had began to worke out in a mor oral less labor system
the utility of consumption as in evidence of wealth is to be classed as a giv of growth
such consumption as false to the women is merely incidental to their wor it is a means to their continued labour and not consumption directed to their own comfort and fullness of life
with a further advance and culture this to b m changed into simple custom of a mor or less regis character but what ever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it bea bo or a large of conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leasure class
under the to bo certain victuals and m particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the f us of stimulants therefore tent in their turned to become horrific as being a mark at the second remove of the superior states of those who are able to af for it the indulgence
it has even happened that the name for certain disease conditions of the body arising from for from such an origin has passed into every day speech as a synonym for nobles or gentle
the consumption of luxuries in the true sense his consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
with many qualifications with more qualifications u as the patriarchal tradition has gradual weakened the general ru is fell to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters
the objections of course presents itself that expenditure and women's dress and household prefer is an obvious exceptions to this ro but it will appearing the secretions much m obvious ands of essential

the wearing of uniforms lives implies a considerable degree of dependance and they evenly said to be amar of servitude real or ostensible
the wearers of uniforms liberius may be redly div did int two classes the free and the curvin or the nobles and the ignoble
but the general distinctions not the mc count to be overlooked
so those offices which are by wight the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms an equants and like in short those which mad be class a su ostensibly predatory employments
whenever as in these cases the menial service questions has to do directly with a prim re leasure employments of fighting in hunting it easily requires a reflected on aff characters

the dependent to was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected lat develop of the institutions when the number of persons by whom these du toy sar customary performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last
but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of v cares leisure in consumptions devolve upon the wife alow
in the communities of the weston culture this points at present found among the lower middle class
if beauty comfort as achieved and it is amore less for tu to circumstance if they they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economical of voice at efforts
the man of the household also cond something in d diction an indeedy commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slams the man and presently also the children virtual cased to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sol exponent of a households pecuniary decency
very much of squall and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket by the last pretense of pecuniary decencies put away
there is no class and no country that yielded so objected before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratifications of this higher or spiritual needed
the questions which of the two methods almost effectively reachd the persons whose convictions it is desired to affects
each will therefore serve about equally well dinging the earner stages of social growth
the mon organizations of industry works in the same directional also v other line
it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direct of height thing the utility conspicuous consumptions as compared with leisure
it des also noticeable that the sus ability consumptions a means of repute as well as the insistance on it as an element of decency is at its bestest in those portions of the community with human contact of the individuals widest and the ma ability of the populations greatest
consumption be comes large at element in the stander of living in the city th in the country

the result is a great ma ability of the labor employing printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined in considerable body of workman
under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary e relations pretty evenly between them at the outset
but the actual course of development has been somewhat different for from this ideal scheme leisure held the first pace at the start and came told the rank firm above wasteful consumption of goods both the direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the course i peaceful culture
other circumstance permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon protective efficiency and on whatever is of humans
a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is affected by resorted to make believe men intricate polite observances and social duties of a sermon neal nature are developed many organizations founded with some specious object of ameliorations boded in their official stand title there is much coming in going and a deal of talk to the end that the talk is may not ha occasion to reflect on what is the effect choral economic value of their craft
the sailor features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
throughout the entire revolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods of services or human life rends the obvious implications that in order effectually men the consumes goodest been an expatiate of superfluities
as use in the speech of every day life the word carries an undertone of depreciation
the use of the word wast as a technical turned therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by consumer under this cannon of conspicuous wist
but it is another grounds worth noting that the turn waste in the language of everyday life in implied depreciation of what is characters s wasteful
in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste at such expenditure as his incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
and to go may be useful and wasteful both and its tiled to consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most fairing proportions

to celebrate the arrival of hers son sylvia gave a splendid supper to which she had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance
without saying it positively she made me understand that being herself and illustrious member of the republic of letters she was well aware that she was speaking to an insect
in order to please her i spoke to her of the abbey conti and i had occasioned to quote two lines of that profound writer
madame corrected me with a patronising air for by pronunciation of the word scored which means divided saying that it ought to be pronounced scare and she added that i ought to be veryain glad to have learn so much on the first day of of my arrival in paris telling me that it would be an important day in my life
her face was an ae ma ford inspired everyone with the warmest sympathy and yet if you examined it attentively there was not one beautiful feature she could not be called handsome but no one could have thoughte her ugly
sylvia was the add orations of france and her talent was the real supports of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her especially of the plays of marya o for without herr his comedies would never have gone to posterity
silvia did not think that her good conduct was a merit for she knew that she was virtuous only because herself love compelled her to be so and she nevers exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority tows theatrical sisters although satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by virtue
two years before her death i saw her performed the characters of mary anne in the comedy of mero and in spite of her age and declining health the illusion was complete
she was honorably buried in the church of saints of her without the slightest oppositions from the venerable priest who far from sharing the ant christian intolerance of the clergy and general said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good christian and at the earths was a common mother of all human beings as jesus christ had been the saviour of all mankind
you will forgive me dear reader if i have made you attend the funeral of sylvia ten years before her death believe me i have no intention of performing a miracle you may console yourself with the idea that i shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor sylvia dies
i never had any family
i had a name i belie even in my young days but i have forgotten it since i have been in service
i shall calle you spree
youll to me a great
he go d me change for a louis i have it s

i see a quantity of chairs for higher at the rate of one su men reading the newspaper under the shade of the trees girls and men breakfasting either alone more in company waiters who were rapidly going up and down a narrow staircase hidden the foliage
i sit down at a small table a waiter comes immediately to inquire my wishes
i done to give me some coffee if it is good'
then turning towards me he says that i looked like a foreigner and would when i say that i am m italian he begs to speak tom me of the cort the city of the theatres and at last he office to accompany me everywhere
i thank him and take my leave
i addressed him in italian and he answers veryain but his way of speaking makes me smile and i tell him why
my remark pleases him but i soon proved to him that it is not the right way to speak however perfects m have been the language of an ancient writer
i see a crowd and one corner of the garden everybody standing still on looking up
is there not a meridian everywhere
yes but the midian of the play royal is the most exacts
that is true bad gree
all these honest persons are waiting their turned to get their snuff boxes filled
it is sold everywhere but for the last three weeks nobody will use any snuff but that sold at the suve cat
is it better than any were else
but how did she managed to render it so fashionable
simply i stopping her carriage two or three times before the shop to have hers n box filled and by saying allow to the young girl who handed back the box that h sough was the veryain best in paris
you are now in the only country in the world where wit can make a fortune by selling either a genuine or of false article in the first case it receives the well go of intelligent and talented people and in the second fools are always ready too reward it for silliness is truly a characteristic of the people here and however wonderful it may appear sills is the daughter of wit
let a man run and everybody will run after him the crowd will not stop unless the man is proved to be mad but to prove it' is indeed a difficult task because we have a crowd of men who mad from from their birth are still considered wise
it seems to me i replied that such approval such ratifications of the opinion expressed by the king the princes of the blooded cetera is rather reproof of the affections felt forth them by the nations for the french carry that affection to such an extent that they believe them in fallible
when the king comes to paris everybody calls out val a roy
shem introduced me to all her guests and gave me some particulars respecting everyone of them
what so i saide to him and my fortunate enough to see you
he himself resided at the same passage in french and politely pointed out the parts in which he thoughted that i had improved on the original
for the first days sir i think that what you have done gives great hopes of you and without any doubt you will make rapid progress
i believe it sir and that his what i fear therefore the principle objective my visit here is to devote myself entirely to the study of the french language
i am veryain unpleasant pupil always asking questions curious troublesome insatiable and even supposing that i couldn't meet with the teacher i require i am afraid i have not rich enough to pay him

he had a good appetite could tell it good story without laughing with celebrated for his w rebs in his sociable manners but he spent his life at home seldom going out and seeing hardly anyone because he always had a pipe in his mouth and was surrounded by at least twenty cats with which he would amuse himself all day
his housekeeper had the management of everything she never allowed him to be in needed of anything and she gave no accounted of his money which she kept altogether because he never asked her to render any accounts
on the sixth of april eighteen thirty the church of jesus christ of latter day saints was formerly organized and thus took on a legal existence
its origin was small a germ and insignificant seeded hardly to be thought of as likely too arouse oppositions
in sad of but six regularly affiliated members and at most two scour of adherence the organizations today many hundred thousand souls
in place up a single hamlet in the smallest corner of which the members could have congregated there now are about seventy stakes of zion and about seven hundred organized words each ward and stake with its full compliment of officers and preceded organizations
the practice of gathering its pros lit into one place prevents the billing up and strengthening of foreign branches and inasmuch as extensive and strong organizations are seldom that with broad very erroneous ideas exist concerning the strength of the church
nevertheless the muster seed among the smallest of all seeds has attain the proportions of a tree and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches the acorn is now in oak offering protections and the sweets of satisfactions to every earnest pogrom journeying its way fir truth
their eyes were from from the first turned in anticipations toward the evening sun not mealy that the work of pros ling should be carried on in the west but that the head quarters of the church should be there established
the book moment had taught the people the true origin and destiny of the american indians and towards this dark skin remnant of once mighty people the missionaries of mormonism early turned their eyes and with her eyes went their hearts and their hopes
it is notable that the indian tribes have gaily regarded the religion of the latter day saints with favor singing in the book mormon striking agreement with her their own traditions
the first well established seat of the church was in the pretty little town of curt land ohio almost within sight of l deary and here soon rose the first temple of modern times
to the fervent latter day saint a temple is not simply e church building a house for relies assembly
soon thousands of converts had rented or purchased to home toes to miserie in dependence jackson counting being their center but from the first they were unpopular among the missions
the lieutenant governor little brent the bew boggs afterward governor was a pronounced warm in hater and throughout the period of the troubles he mad ifs is sympathy with the persecutes
their sufferings have never yet been fitly chronicle by human scribe
making that way across the river those the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of clay county and afterward established themselves in called well county they founding the city of far west
a small settlement had been founded by mormon families u show creek and here on the thirties of october eighteen thirty eight accompany of two hundred and forty fell upon the hapless settlers and butcher a score
be it said to the honour of some of the officers intrusted with a terrible commission that when they le its true significance they resign their authority rather than have anything to do with what they des in a cold blooded butchery
oh what are record to read what a pictured the gaze upon how awful the fact
american schoolboys read with emotions of horror of be albigenses driven beaten and killed with a papal legate directing the butcher and nevah du hunted and hou like beasts as the effective a rail decree and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as these in the exhibitions of injustice and inhuman hate
who began the quarrel was at the mormons
as dabble of the press comments against at the brutality of the meran's i quote a paragraph from from the quincy argus marched sixteenth eighteen thirty nine
it will be observed that in organized mob aided by many of the civil and military officers of missouri governor bogs at their head have been the prominent actors in this business incited too it appears against the moments by political hatred and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge
the army found the people in poverty and left them in comparative wealth
but awd further concerning the expeditions in general
it was through voids advised that became in order the military expedition to you ostensibly to install certain federal officials and to repress an leg infant tow valiant which in fact had never come into existence but in reality to further the interest of the successions
moreover had the people been inclined to rebellion wh gat her opportunity could they have wished
already and north and his south were talk do wh not c a boss a west
they knew no north no south th east no they stood positively by the constitution and when have nothing tod in the bloody strife between brothers unless indeed they were summoned by the authority too which they had already once lery responded to furnish men in arms for the countries needed
what the latter day sides calls less marriage his characteristic up the church and is in veryain general practice but of c less to marriage plurality of wives was an incident never and essential
we believe in a literal resurrections and an actual hereafterward feature state shall be recognized every sanctified an authorize relationship existing here on ef of par and child brother in sister husband and wifely
it has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands to observe the customs and studied the habits of more nations one and i yet to finde the place in meet to people wearing with whom the purity of man and woman his held more precious then among the mind mormons in the mountain valleys of the west
at the inception of bor marriage among the latter day saints there no long national or state against s practice
in eighteen sixty two a law was act with a purpose of suppressing bal marriage and as had been predicted in the national sate per to its passage it lay for many years a dead letter
feeder judges and united states attornies and muta who were not warms nor lovers of moan ism refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the lawk because of its manifest injustice end inadequacy
this m that for ledge mister meaner for which congress prescribed and maxim pity of six months imprisonment and a find of three hundred dollars a man might be a prison for life i for many terms of a men's natural life to the courts power to enforce it sentences extend so far and might be findin millions of dollars
before this travesty on the administrations of law could be brought before the cort of last resort and there met with the reversal in rebuke it deserved m were imprison under sentence of many years duration
the people contested these measures one by one in the courts presenting in case after case the different faces of the subjects and urging the unconstitutional ey of the measure
than the church was disan cooperated and its property real and personal confiscated and aged to the government of the united states and although the personal property was soon restored re state of grat value long lay in the hands of the courts receiver and the moran church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property
and so the story of moment ism runs on its finally has not y had been written the current press presents continuously new sties of its progress new developments of its plan

what she wanted from us was neither o flowers nor our francs but just our youth
they were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money c give you a happy love

bartle started when held a ran a little bell beside her dear me why did you do that

alexander went over and opened the window for her

he stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said it's soften misty see how white the stars are
for long time he the hill a nor bartle spoke
he felt a trimmer run through the slender yellow figure at front of him
bartle le over her shoulder without touching her and whispered in her ear you are giving me a chance yes
alexander clutched the two hands at his sides
the stop at queen's town the tedious passage up the mercy or things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience
she blushed in smiled and followed his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs
alexander paced up and downy hallway but ning unbuttoning his overcoat until she returned and took him up to hild his living room
the room was empty way entered
alexander did not sit down
i felted in my bones when i woke a s morning that something splendid was going to turn up
i th it might be sister cat her cousin like would be happening
she pushed him towards the big chair by the fire and sat down on a stool of the opposite side of the hearth her knees drawn up to her chin laughing like a happy little girl
when you you come bartle and how did it happen you haven't spoken a word
i got in about ten minutes ago
alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze
bartle bent lowered over the fire
she looked at his heavy shoulders and bigg determined head rust ford like a catapult and leach
i'll doe anything you wish me too barley shes said tryest l

he pulled up a windows if the air were heavy
hill to watched him for from the corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes it

what is slinging
we have never understood this' sword of objections
slang is odious
slang makes one shudder
who did nice that of course it does
when it is a questioned of probing a wound a go a society since one has it been considered wrong to go too far to going to the bottom
we have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and at least is simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted in fulfilled merits
why should one night explore everything and study everything
why should one halt on the way
nothings is more lugubrious than the contemplations thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang
now when has horror ever excluded study
since when has malady banished medicine
can one imagine an naturalist refusing to study the viper the bat the scorpion the speede the tanta and one who would cast them back into their darkness saying oh how ugly that is
he would be like a philologist refusing to examine e fact in language if philosopher hesitating to scrutinise aft in humanity
what is slang properly speaking
it is the language of wretchedness
we may be stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms which is one way of attenuating it we may be told that al tat professions it may be added all the accidents of the social higher orkan all forms of intelligence have their own sling
the painter who says my grinder the notary whose says my skip of a getter the ha dresser whose says my meal back the cobler who he says my cube talks slang
there is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the presses
the char manufacturer who says lo clarified lumps bastard common burnt this honest many factor talk slang
algebra medicine bony have each their sling
to meet the means of this conflict wretchedness has invented language of combat which withes sling
to keep a float and to rescue from oblivion to hold above the goff where it but a fragments of some language which men has spoken and which would otherwise be lost that is to say one of the elements goode or bad of which civilizations composed or by which it is complicated to extend the records of social observations is to serve civilizations itself
phoenician veryain goode
even dii what let that pass
to this we reply in one word only
assuredly if the tongue which nations or province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is stilled more worthy of attentions and study
and then we insist upon it the study of social deformities and infirmities and the task of pointing them out with the view to remedy is not a business in which choices permitted

do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern
they cones d two different orders of facts which correspond to each others which are always into lac and which often bring forth results
true history being a mixture of all things the true historian mingles in everything
fs form one of these and ideas the other
there it clothes itself in word masks in ma f rags
in the skies it becomes horrible
one perceives without understanding it a hideous murmur sounding almost like human accents but more nearly resembling a howel than inarticulate word
one things one here's high dress talking
it is unintelligible in the dark
it is blacking in misfortune it is blacker stilled crime these two blackness is amalgamated compose sling
the earths not devoid of resemblance to a jail
look closely at life
it is is so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment
each day has its own great gree fords little care
yesterday were trembling for health that his dear to you to day you fear for your own to morrowed will be anxiety about money the day aftermath the slanderer the day after that the misfortune of some friend then the prevailing weather then something that has been broken n lost thin a pleasure with which your conscience and youre verb cums rep hou you again the course of publick affairs

the real human divisions this for luminous and the shady
to diminish the member of the shady to augment the number of the lines that is the objects
that is why we cried educational science
to teach reading means to like the fire everye out sparkles
however he who says light does not necessarily say joy

ruth sat quite still for aimee with face intent and flushed it was out now
the sights years returned in high spirits from the city
ruth asked the enthusiast if they were by to live in such a as sounding muzzle with its great halls and echoing rooms and no comfortable place in it for the accommodations of anybody
and then there was broad street
there certainly was no int it and evened ruth was philadelphian enough to believe that a street ought not have any end or arch dur boa upon which the weary eye could rest
but neither sain gerard nor broad street neither wonders of the me nor the glories of the hall where the ghosts of our fathers si always signing the declarations impressed the visitors so much as the splendors of the chestnut street windows and the bargains on aid street

miss woodley was too little verst in the subjects to know this would have been not to love at all at least not to the extent of baking through engagements and all the vari sob stakes that stills mitigated against their unions

it was quite true that a basle was in sight hardly more than six miles from from the shore but owing to the increase in the earths convexity and the consequent limitations of the range of visions the rigging of the top masts alone was visible above the water

it was on the last day of january that the repairs of the schooner were completed
a slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alterations in the earths orbit was a questioned which would still require several days to decide

the late astounding events however had rendered procope manifestly uneasy and not less so from his consciousness that the counts secretly partook of his own anxiety

he made an effort to hide this conditions from them all and robin felt his fingers tighten upon his arm
begged me a room of the share off child quickly
but who isis fellow plucking at steve
he is my esquire excellency returned robin with dignity
mistress fitzooth had been carried off by the serfs daughter in her maids as soon as they had entered the house so that robin alone have the care of mony shay
robin was glad when at length they were left her their own devices
the win did certainly bringing back the color to the squats cheeks
these escapades are not for old game well lad his day has come to twilight
will you forgive me now
it' will be no disappointment to me
no thanks i am glad to give you such easy happiness
youre are worthy le will presently whispered robin the wine has worked to marvel
i and show u some pretty tricks
young fitz had beene commanded to his mother's chamber so as soon as he had come out from his converts with the squire
there be fell an anxious interview mistress ssh arguing foreign against the squires projected a breath
most of all robin thought of his father what would he counsel
if for w you beggar yourself i cannot stay you
but take it whilst live and where month fe chase shielded in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so brave sight for you will never disgrace oc touch and i warn at me
the lad eject and

he was in deep converts with the clerk and enter the hall holding him by the arms
now to bed boyd

dismiss squire robin and bidd me good een
as any an england i would say said came well proudly that is in his day
yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come
there was no chance to altered his sleeping room to one nearer to gain wells chamber
presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step
will cried he softly and stoutly who which chosen his count across the door of his young master's chamber sprang up at once at answer
we will go out together to the bower there is away down to the court for from my window
rest and be still until they warn you
the hours passed wearily by and move it could yet be heard about the hall
at last all was quiet and black in the courtyard of gamewell
will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready
they then renewed their journey and under the better light meade to save crossing of the stable roofs
robin entered to hot dragging the unwilling quire
be not so foolish friend said fitz crossly
they moved there after cautiously about the hut groping before an about them to find something to show that the wanton had fulfilled his mission
they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stoutly had tripped over the edge of the reversed flat mouth of pit
fitz ohs hand rested at last upon the top run of a latter and slowly the truth came to him
robin carefully descended the latter and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground
studley was by his side in the flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and characters of his vault
from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice warrenton's
safely masters but you startled me rarely
cried he waving the lanthorn before him to make sure that these were no ghosts and front of him
inquired robin with his suspicions still upon him
truly such a horse would be worth much in notting him fair
nay lording answered warrenton with a half laugh
warrenton spoke thus with significance to show robin that he was not think jeffreys claims to the estate will be passed by
robin fitz saw that his doubts of warrington had been unfair and he became ashamed himself for harboring them
his tones ran pleasantly unworn tens ears and forthwith the goodfellow ship was harald it between them
the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gain wil this passageway led from the hut in a pleasance to sure wood and that jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
he implores as to be discreet as the grave in this matter forsooth his life is in the hollow of our hands
they regain their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gain well
out in the woods stood a nice little fer tee
the place he had was a veryain good one the sun shown on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and rounded him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as furs
he did not think of the warms son and of the fresh air he did not care fort the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
but this was what the tree couldn not bear to hear
in winter when the snow lag glittering on the ground a hair would often come leaping along and jumped right over the little tree
oh that made him so angry
to growl and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that aftermost delight ful thing in the worlds
in autumn the woodcutters always came and felled some of the largest trees
this happened everye year and the young fir trey that had now grown too a veryain c sizes trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earths with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked longed and beare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were lading carts and the horses dragged of them out of the wood
have you not neet them many with
rejoice in thy growth saide the sunbeams
then what happens them
i would fain now if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
i am now tall in my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh
where i but al ready on the carts
where i in the wm room with all the splendor in magnificence
yes and something better something still pre will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ornament me
something better something still grander must follow but what
re choice in our presence said the air and the sunlight
rejoice in my owne fresh youths
but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winters in summer
and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut downs
the ax struck deep into the veryain pip the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pangs like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful that being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
the departure was not at all agreeable
the tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we don't want the others
there two were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture box and full of toys were hundreds and the hundreds of crowns at least the childrens and so a
the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
this evening they all said
howe it will shinin this evening
perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to lookit me
it blazed up famously help help
cried the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire
a story
a story cried the children drawing the little fat man towards the tree
but i shall tell only one story
h be don't be fell downstairs and yet he married the princess
that's the way of the world
thought the fur tree and believed all because the man who told the story was so good looking well weller
i won't trembled to morrow thought the fir trey
and the whole night the tree stood still and indeed thought
in the morning the servants and the house maine came in
but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
wh the meaning of this thought the tree
and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie
time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in the corner out of the way
t is now winter out of doors thought the tree
how kind man us after alla
if only would not so dark here and so terribly lonely
squeak squak
they snuffed about the fur tree and rustled among the branches
i am by no means old said the fur tree
there's many o one considerably older than i am
they were so extremely curious
i know no such place said the tree
and then he told all aboute his youths and the little mice had never heard the light before and they listened and said
said the fur tree thinking over what he had himself related
yes in reality those more happy times
who he's upon't pe asked the mice
only that one answered the tree
it is a veryain stupids story
don't you know one about bacon and ca cans can't shot any lars stories
no said the tree
then good b said the rats and they went home
at last the little ms state away also and the tree side after all it was veryain pleasant when the sleep little m sat rounded me and listened to what i told theme
now that too was over
why one morning there came a quantity of people and s to work in the loft
the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and throne rather hard it is true downs on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
but it was not the fur tree that they mens
it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
in the courtyards some of the mary children were playing who had danced at christmas rounded the fur tree and were so glad at the side of him
and the gardeners boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
the wood flamed up splendidly under the large bring copper and its sighed so deeply
however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end
genet bath refrained from telling that other girls or uncle john of old will rogers visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for fortune eject
it was a serious crim indeed mister watson told them him and on gates big fair to serve length the term in the states prison as a consequence of his rash act

there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrew face
he might have had that fort check for the face of it if he been sharp

one of mister hoped ins first tasks after calling his faithful inch been around him was to make a careful cess of the voters of his district toes see what was still to be accomplished

the democratic committee figured out a way to do this

the only thing necessary was too fixed set reals and this hops arranged personally
and this was why kenneth and bath discovered him conversing with the young woman in the bucky
the description she gave of the coming reception to the women's political lee was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were
these women were flattered by the attentions of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing mister forbes
louise hoped for excellent results from from this organizations and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted

the three modes of management
to suppose that the objects of this work is to aide in affecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and designe
by reason an affections
as the chase drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicions of her mother' disappointment vexations and ill humour serge and swell among those delegate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps and a reparable injury
the mother as soon as the chase is so far turned that marry can no longer watch the expression of her confidence goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfactions on her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice
so you will be a good' girl i know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't you
the mother' managing the case in this way razed partly un convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appealed to her affections
if you should not be a good girl but should show signed of makings any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone
but this last supposition is almost always un necessary fort if mary has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble
it is indeed true that the importance of tacked and skill in the training of the younger and of cultivating their reason and securing their affections can not be overrated
to such persons these indirect modes of training childrens in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
della had a young's sister na and a cousin whose name was jane
now ga contrived to obtain a great influence and as sec over the minds of the children by means of these dolls
to give an idea of these conversations i will report one of them in full
you have come and della and del was the name of janes to make rosy a visit
i am veryain glad
i expect you have been a very goode girls ella since you were here last
then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone h shep in a good girl jane
for instance one day the children had been plain upon the piazza with blocks and other play things and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
they were now playing with their dolls in the parlour
delia came to the parlour and with an air of great mystery beckon the children aside and set to them in a whisper leave and ella and rosy hare and don't say awd them
so saying she led the way on u tic too followed by the childrens out of the room and round by a scoot to the piazza there
said she pointing to the play things see
put these play things all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know anything about you leaning them out
and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any directs rebukes or expressions of this pleasure addressed personally too them would have been
nature of the effects produced by early impressions
that is comparatively nothing
they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
we go to any such extreme as this we can easily see u on reflections how vast in influence on the ideas and conceptions as well is on the principles of action inure years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood had impress upon the mind
the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a fathers subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
but ands cared nothing about that
he made about so deep that his back came near breaking and he was done founded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but ands
he was such a bigg boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife
now this knife was a splendid one though half the blab was gone and the hander was a little cracked and ands neo that one is al most am man as soon as one has a jack knife

and she took ands hand and walked within him up the bad marvell stairs where soldiers reposed at everythin through the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing where ever he went
four like as not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine chap
at the farther end of the largest hall a tablet was set with golden cups and golden plates in longed rose
on huge silver platters were paid of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering de cans
the princess set down under a blue canopy with b ce a roses and she let under sit in a golden chair by her side
but you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to d get off
the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly like to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any conditions
he only shook his head
well but now said the princess and she she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him
that is a veryain fine capt you have he said
so it is said ands
and it is made of mother's best yarn and she knitted that herself and everybody once to get it away from me
with one jumpers got out of his chair
he darted like an arrow through all the halls downe all the stairs and across the yards
he still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their ms open
but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a kings golden crowned he said that enders was a stupid
ands face grew red
but his mother hug been close
no my little son shes said
if you dressed him sil and gold from top to to you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap
at the conclusion of the bank which was served it five o'clock the king entered his cabinet where his tailors or awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imaginations and had caus so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornate workers of the court
hah veryain well

he has given them with too much grace not to have other still to give if they are required which is the case at the present moment
it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned
does your majesty then no longer believed the disloyal attempt
not at all you are on the contrary most agreeable to me
your majesty's planed then in this affair is
you will take them from my private treasure
the news circulated with the rapidity of lightening during its progress at kindled every vot of coquetry desire and wild ambition
the kan had completed his toilet by nin o'clock he appeared in an opened carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers
the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent days or platforms erected upon the borders of the lake in a theater of wonderful elegance of constructions
suddenly for the purpose of restoring piece in order springing accompanied by his hall court mad his appearance
the seasons alle of springing followed him closely to form a quite trail which afterwards of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the dance
his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage in flesh coloured silken hose a silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
there was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seem to so along
yes it is suppressed
far from it sire your majesty hev given no directions about it the musicians retained
yes si and ready dressed for the vale
sire he said your majesties most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he is already shown on the field of battle
the king seemed only pleased with everyone present
monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter
the valley began the effected was more than beautiful
when the musick by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untired pantomime of that period only the more natural on account of the veryain different acting of the august actors had reached its common eating point of triumph the theatre shook with tumultuous applause
disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgment he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the market preference of the princess
by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that as limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupified
the king who had from from this moment become in reality the principle dancer in the quadra casta look upon his vanquished rival
everyone could observe his agitations and prostration a prostration which was indeedy the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his he bewildered and his eyes with all their bright intelligence bended
upon this madame dean to turn her eyes languishingly towards the com observing
do you thinks so she replied with indifference
yes the characters which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own
explained yourself
i allude to the goddess
the princess inquired no
she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance
the arrow peers his heart and wounded him mori
ac quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theatre but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love is th strangely constituted he founded impossible even to remained much longer separated from from their presence of one who had broken his heart
when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in the bids of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself

while the former for told that the scottish cans were secretly forming a unions with the english parliament and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking the latter still insisted that everye such attempt would precipitate them in into measures too which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined
the king's ears were now opened to mont roses counsels who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cause and scotland
five hundred men more who had been levied by the cans were persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combined force he hastened to attack lord elk who lay at perth with an army of six thousand men assembled upon the first news of the irish invasion
dreading the superior power of argyle who have ing joined his vessels to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerable army montrose hastened northward in order to rows again the marquis of hup and the gordons who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the combs

montrose weak in cavalry here line his troops of horse with infantry and after to putting the enemies horse to rout fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cut in pieces th with the loss of gallant lord gordon on the part of the royalists
from from the same men new regiments and new companies were formed different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands as the independents could re l

the analysis of knowledge will occupies until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
what is called perceptions direst from sensations by the fact that the sensational ingredients bringing up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual cortes all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensations
whether are not principle is liable too exceptions everyone would agree that it has broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more corrected to say that id is approximately represent impressions
and what sort of evidence is logically possible
there is not logical impossibility and the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it th was with the populations that remembered a wholly unreal pasted
all that i'm doing is to use its logical tin ability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
the behaviour us to attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour hast to trust his memory and making that the record
habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist fills confined that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
but i do not think such an inference is warranted
our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and comparative the present image
we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
some images like some sensations pill veryain familiar while others fill strange
familiarity a filling capable of degrees
in an image of a well known face for example some parts may fl more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must ha have in order too account for our knowledge of the past
they must have some characteristic which makes us regarded them as preferring too more or less remote portions of the past
in actual fact their are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the flinging of greater or less remoteness and some remembered event
there may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of pasts especially where immediate memory is concerned
there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relations of a remembered ev to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of fillings giving their temporal relations to the present but it is clear that such fillings must play an essential part in the process of dating remember events
if we had retained subjects or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
remembering has to be a present occurrence and someway resembling or re lighted too what is remembered
some points may be taken as fixed and such any theory of memory must arriv at
in this case as in most others what may be taken a certain and advance is rather v
the first of our vague but indubitable data set there as knowledge of the past
we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the pasts which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least served to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards id mediate sey
this distinctions vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate too us the incidence of its past and people are not so different from grandi fons as they like to believe
i can sent to wor now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to e for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasioned on which he has recited or red it
symons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images referred to pass occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge of memory
it is this that is aventures to theory of knowledge
it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusions that all that is happening now happened before at some time
whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it lees us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have founded the appropriate objects which leads us to the judgement this is familiar
thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from for from the flinging of familiarity alone
a further stage is recognition
recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more that a habit of associations the kind of object we are seen at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an ot toy image of paring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognise in the cat of the moment
we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an objected that we have seen it before but this judgment as something over and above recognitions in this firsts sinse and may very avery probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognitions in this first sence of the word
this knowledge is memory and one sense though in another it is not
there are however several points in which such an account of recognitions is inadequate to agin with it m seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before then as this has existed before
the definitions of my experience is difficulty broadly speaking it is everything thats connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory a among the most important
thus if i recognize the things the occasions of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognized it forms part of my experience by definitions the recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is single out from the rest of the world
of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translations of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition

but i mean to have my endings before long
of what missus never been had gone through and providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplish her task with thorough success
we sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then when assure
how much of evil a real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me during the last few days
what c i do now but just lay myself down and die

jack would become even as happy husband and would remain amidst the harry duties of the eager world
thinking all this i went slye

you have received us with all that curtesy in hospitality for which her character in england stands so high
it is a duty said i

i can afford to smile because i am absolutely parlous before you but i doon not the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the worlds concerned i or rather we haven been put down by brute force

but now nothing could hold me back
cons say was my man servant
from from e rub shoulders with scientists little universe by the banal gardens the boy had come to know a thing or too
classifying was everything to him so he do nothing else well verse in that theory of classifications he was poorly first in its practical applications and doubt that he c tells firm whale from a blin whale
and yet what a fine gallant b lad
not once to he comment on the length or the hardships of the journey
never did he object to buckling up his suit case for any country whatever china or the congo no matter how off it was
he went here there and everywhere and perfect contentment
pas forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting that i had turned forty
he was e pic on formality and he only addressed me in the third person to the point were it got hi some
there was good reason to stop and think evened for the worlds most in motionless man
con say i called a third time conseil appeared
their masters so manon me he said entering

a rout slightly less direct that's
relieving on the abraham b lincoln
you se my friend its issue of the monster the notorious nor while
we don't know where will take us
but were going just the same
we have a commander whose game for anything for
left instructions for shipping my contains of stuffed animals and dried plants to pars france
i open the line credit sufficient to cover the buba and conseil at my heels i jumped into a carriage
our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate i rushed aboard
i asked her commander fagot
one of the sailors led me to the afterdeck where i stood in the presence of a smart looking officer who extended his hand to me
in in person welcome boy professor your cabin is waiting fort you
i was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officer's ms
will be quite comfortable here i told conseil
and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or evenness the fet would have gone without me and i would have missed out on u earthly extraordinary in inconceivable expedition whose tu story might well meet with some skepticism
the wars of brickland and every part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers
departing from five hundred thousand throats three cheers burst forth in succession
thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hinging the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the huts and river at the tip of the long pons of that forms new y you city
then he rushed downstairs into the courtyard shouting loudly foras his soldiers and threatening too patch everybody his dominions at the sailorman was not recaptured
hold him fast my man and as soon as i've had my coffee and ole i'll take him to the room of the great knife and pat him
i would you mind tok offing myself said cap i have had consider ber exits eyes this moran and an ally for breakfas
but cap'n bill made no such attempt knowing it would be useless
as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boo ga a yellow disappointment
the room of the great knife was high and bigg and around it ran rose of benches for the spectators the situ upon
in one blace at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant thrown chairs for the king and qua and six smaller but richly opposed chairs for this nod's princesses
therefore her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her
rich duels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as cori s as as the were haughty and overbearing
marny gars bevil as wells you look
control yourselves in my dears replied the bloo the worst punishment i know how do him l on an this prisoners b to suffer you will see a veryain pretty patching my royal daughters
suppose its of brain
the captain shook his head
why you sic to thatch that thirst living cat met and that wasp goat replied the captain panting hard as held fast one the goats worms
the idea patching cap'n bill to a goat was a vastly amusing to him and a more heat thought of it the more he roared with laughter
they look something al you know suggested the captain of the guards looking from one to the other doubtfully and then nearly the same ses it you stan above on his hind legs they've both got the same stile of whiskers and the both them obstinate in dan des so they ought to make a good patch splendid
fine paris
when this had been accomplished the bluer leaned overt to tri do you a discover wide the frame rowed away seemingly of its own a cord and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before
at once the goat gave a leap escape from the sods and with bou head rushed upon the boom
before any could stopped him he boded his majesty so furiously that the king swords far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay moning and groaning
the goats warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack
then they speed in great haste for the door and a go gave a final but this in the ro of royal ladies all dieting into the corridor in anotherin tangle where u may shrieked in a mater that terrified everyone woman th sound of their voices
i the notions was you mad d save me from from the knife
i didn't shut a much being bounds or tight awl sing to have j sone but shiver to relieve my feels
coming that the m r she s going toward the benches
so they were quite willing to oby the orders of their girl quam and a short time the glass of trumpets and rolla of drums and clashing of semples told trot and captain bill that the blue bands had assembled before the palace
then they all march s a little way into the field and found that the army of thinks had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them
at the head of the pinkies were get ghisizzle and by e bright who had the pair on hiss shoulder and there were supported by captain cory and captain t tent and rosily the which
when the blueskin saw git kisses all they raised another great shout for he was the favourite of the soldiers and veryain popular with all the people
since last thursday i gi ges all have been a lawful blue ro of the blue country but now that you are conquered by queen shot i suppose i am compt and you have no bo at all
when he fe ish shes said cheerfully

now then let's entered this the city and enjoyed a great feast its being cooked i nearly star myself forcing kingdoms his hard work
then she gave rose back her mt grain thanking the kind which for all she had done for them

it will be such a satisfaction
the guards had a terrible struggle with a goat which was loosen the room and still w to fight but finally they subdued the animal and then they tok the boo out of the fringing was tide in and brought bothy the goat before queen trot who waited them in the thrown room of the palace
i'll gladly do that promised u new bloo an i feed the honorable go all the shavings and leather ten cans gat the size the grass
excuse me said shot i ne gle tell you that you're not the bill any more
the former biliary ground
hy wicked anymore sid the old bloo how reformed
as a private citizen i shall be a mode of deportment because it would be dangers to be otherwise
when first they entered the thrown room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever but the blues who were as simple there all laughed at them endeared them for there was not a single person in all the blue country who loved the princesses the least little bit
so gi gases or order the captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home
that evening try gave a grand ball and the palace to which the most important of the pinkies in the blueskins were invited
the combined bands of both the countries played the musica and a fine supper was served
brighter than early dawns most brilliant die are blown clear bands of color through the sky that swirl and sweeps and meet to break and found like rainbow veils upon bubbles done
guided by you how we might stroll towards death our only musick one another's breath through garden's intimate with hollyhocks where silent poppies burned between the rocks by pools where burgs b toy confidence above green waters scum with lily plans
venice
in a sunset glowing of crimson and gold she lives the glory of the world a beached king's galley whose sails are th he was hun withheld
the pity that we must come and go
while the old gold and the marbles days f for ever glim me it soft strong blaze call in the early evening glow
thei pleasant gr yard of my soules with sentimental cyprus trees and flowers is filled that im m stroll and meditations at my ease
it is my heart hung in the sky and no clouds ever float between the greve flowers and my heart on high
over the track lin city street the young men the grinning men pass
h y sails that seemed to wonder in dream thrilled meadows say is the shore where i stand the only filled of struggle or are hee hit and better out there by waves and w gust as he tack over a clashing sea of watery echoes
old dances are simplified of their yearning bleached by time
he had got into her courtyard
through the black night rain he sang to her window bars
that was but rustling of dripping plans in the dark
she was alone that night
he had broken into her courtyard
to fad away like morning beauty from from her moral day down by the river of a dana her soft voices heard and thus her gentle lamentations falls like morning doe
o life of this are springing
why fades the load of the walter
why fad these children of the spring
fell is like a watry bow and like apart clouded like a reflections in a glass like shadows in the water like dreams of infants like a smile upon it infants face
like the debs voice like transient day like musick in the air ahhh
and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gently here the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time
the ly of the valley bathing in the humble grass answered the love we maiden said i am a watch re weeded and i am veryain smalls and left to dwell in lowly veils so weak the gilded butter fly scarce purchase on my head yet i am visited from heavens and he that smiles on all walks in the vy and each morn over me spreads his hand saying rejoice thou humble grass thou newborn lily flower
thou gentle made of silent valleys and of modest brooks for thou shall be clothed in light and fed with morning manna till summers heat melts the beside the fountains and the springs to flourish in eternal veils they why should fell complained
why should the mistress of the veils of har utters
she ceased and smiled tears then sat downed in her silver shrine
which thou dust scatter on everye little blade of grass thats springs revives the milk cow and tames the fire breathing steeds
but thou is like a faint cloud kindle that the rising sun i vanish from my pearl throne and who shall find my place
and why it scatters its bright beauty though the human air
descend no little cloud and hover before the eyes of fell
o little cloud the virgin said i charged thee to tell mee why thou complain now when in one hour thou fate away then we shall seek thee but not find ah fell is like to thee
i pass away yet i complain and no one' hears my voice
the cloud then showed his golden head and his bright form emerged
and forest thou because i vanish and am seen no more
it is too ten full lifemate peace and raptures wholly unseen descending way my light wings upon balmy flowers and cort the fair i do to take me to her shining tent the weeping virgin trembling meals before the risen sun
till we arise linked and a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers
lives not alone nor of itself fear not and i will call the weak worm from from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear it's voice
come forth warm and the silent valley to thy pensive queen
the helpless warm or rose and sat upon the les leaf and the bright cloud sail on to fined his partner in the veil
image of weakness art thou but a worm
i see they lay helpless th naked weeping a none to answer none to cherish thee with mother's smiles
and says thou mothers of my children i have loved thee and i have given the a crown that none can take aways
and lay me downing in ey cold bed and leave my shining lot
or an i have gifts and graces showering fruits and coined gold
why a tongue impressed with honey from from everye wind
why an ear a worl poo fierce to draw creations in
alway said without a word
i sit beneath thy looks as children do in the noon sun with souls that tremble through their happy islands from an une verd yet pron inward joy
i did not wrong myself so but i placed a wrong on thee
when called before i told how hastily i dropped my flowers or break off from again
shall i never miss home talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each in turn nor counted strange when i look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home and this
alas i have grieved so i am hard to love
open th hard wide and folded within the wed wings of thy dove
could it mean to last love said pendulous betweens sorrow and sorrow
nay i rather thrilled distrusting every light that seemed to gil the onward path and fear to over lean a finger even
and though i have grown serene and strong since then i think that god his willed a still renew b fear
o love o trots
and love be faults
if he to keep one oh must lose one joy by his life's star fort
slowed to world greetings quick with its o lest when the angel speak
a ringing of aeth i could not ware here plainer too my sight then that first kiss
that the chrism of lovee which loves own crowned with sank to finding sweetness did proceeded the third upon my wits was folded down in perfects purple state since when indeed i have been proud and said my love my own
dearest teach me so to po out gratitude as thou dust good
moslems and guys through curtius at a smile and have no ruth fort any weeping
but thou art not such a lover my beloved
thou canst wait through sorrowing sickness to bringing sols to touch and think it soon when others cry too late
i think all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and lovee from mine
oh to shoot my souls f meaning into future years that they should lend it utter its and salute love that endures from life that disappears
then i long tried by natural ills received the comfort fast while budding at thy sight my pilgrims staff gave out green lees with morning dos
i love the freely as men strive for right i love thee purely as they turned from praises
i love thee with the passion putt use in my all greats in with my childhood's faiths
i love thee with love i seemed to lose with my lost saints i love thee with the breaths smiles tears of all my life and if god choose i shallow but love thee better
