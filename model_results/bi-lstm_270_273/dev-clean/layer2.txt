he saw that in the excitement of reason events he had not formulated a plan upon that score
he was getting some beak comfort out of a goods f that it was not pia for the ill which affected him
it was with great oppositions after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmations and denial that at last he got am beli placed in the requested mount and slowly sealed up
then he fall harry the boy of all work around the place
you take this to this address he said handing him the anglo and give its to missus hurstwood yester said the boy
an answer i gess not
the boy hastened away and the manger felted his musings
he was beaten for to night and he might just as well make the best of it
she would take the blob and know that she had triumphed
if he only have that let her back he wouldn't send it
for relief he arose and joined in the conversations with a few friends he were drinking
all the teas thoughts would read out to his home and see the seen being there and acted
in about an hour and three quarters the boy returned
he danced as he s his desk that nothing would be done for o a weaker too meanwhile he would have time to think
how ab that now his pain at her failure to meet arright him rapidly increased as he devoted himself to the subjects
he decided to rite her care of the w side post office and ask for an explanations as well as to have her meet him
three ol came four five six and no letter
the helpless manager past the floor and grimly endured the gloom of defeat
he thought a busy saturday assured out the sabbath in and nothing done
all day the barbe closed he rid alone shut out from home from the excitement of his resort from carry and without thea ability to alter his conditioned one i oder
it was the worst sunday he had spent in his life
it seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning
he was quite sett now that she knew he was married and was angered of his perfidy
he had loved her earnestly enough but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive
he would goat to her tell her all his family complications
he would explained to her just where he stood and how much heeded her
he did managed to bring himself into the moode to go go out to carry but when he got inde place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away
he did not go within a block of the house
he trebled over many little details and talked perfunctory to everybody
he stayed at his desk long after all others had gone and only quit it when the nights watchmen on his round pulled that the front door to see if it was fly locked
im he received another polite note from m gregor jameson hay it read
dear sir we bet to him form me that we are instructed to wight until to morrow thir stay at one o'clock before filing suite against you on be ha of misses julia hurstwood for divorce and al money
very truly yours et cetera compromise
so here it was s pad out clear before him and now he knew what to expect
if he didn't g and seen them they would soon him promptly
preface to the second addition
this is a mistake lo perfectly natural one
on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last advises to the printer
then i had much pleasure in reading it but was indeed surprised that the many little points of similarity between the two books in spite of their entire independence to one anotherin
i regret that reviews have in some cases b inclined to treat the chapters o machines as an attempt to reduce mister darwins theory to an absurdity
i ams surprised however that the picket which such an example of the specious missus of analogy would seem most naturally leveled should have occurred to no review neither shall i mentioned the name of the poore though i should fancy that the hint given suffice
but this effective which i have little reason to complain for i was allowed almost to call them life long self tow see vs to their faces and they said it was quite true but that it did not matter
i must notin clud without expressing my must sincere thanks to my critics to the public for the laden sey and considerations with which they a treated my ventures
it was written in an the upper rags a district of the canary province as it d was of new zealand at appeared at christ church in the press news paper dune thirteenth eighteen sixty three
i also rode about this time the substance of what ultimately be came the musical banks and the trial of a man for being in a consumptions
i see for my second preface that i took the book to messieurs emin and hall may first eighteen seventy one and on their rejection of it under the advice of one who has attained the highest drank among living writers i let it sleep till i took its mister trubner early eighteen seventy too
i tut its u looked for success mainly to two early favourable reviews the first in the palais of april twelfth and the second in the spectator a blew yet
there was also another cause
the first addition of iran sold and about three weeks i had not taken moulds and as the demand was strong it was set up again immediately
i made a few further very avery trifling alterations before mo to were taken but since the summer of eighteen seventy two as new aits were from time to time wanted they have been printed forster as that made
i have still fairly well satisfied with those parts of i that were repeatedly re written but from from those that had only single writing i would gladly cut at out some forty fifty pages if i could
this however may not be for the copy wight will probably expire in a little over twelve years
if the reader will excuse me i will say nothing of my antecedence nor of the circumstances which led me to leave min native country the nat it would be tedious to him and painful to myself
it will be seen that i did not succeeded in my design and that however much i may have met with that was new and strange i have been unable top any pecuniary advantage
no one he who is himself honest will doubt my being so
i reached my destinations and one of the last months of eighteen sixty eight but i dare not mention the season lust the reader should gather in which hems youre i was
shep been catt introduced and bread with extreme rapidity men took up their fifty thousand or one hundred thousand acres of country going inland one behind the others till in a few years there was not an acre between the sea and the front ranges which was not taken up and stations either for shep cattle were spotted about a intervals of some twenty or thirty miles over the whole country
i was delighted with the country and the manner of life
i was to see the sheep not necessarily close at hand or to get them in a single mob but to see enough of them here and there to feel easy that nothing had gone wrong this was no difficult matter for there were not ab ea hundred of them and being all breeding us they were pretty quiet
they were good many sheep which i knew as two or three blacks and black lamb or two and several others which had some distinguishing mark whereby i could tell them
it is surprising how soon the i becomes a custom to missing twenty sheeps out of t three hundreds
it was a monotonous life but it was very healthy and one does not much minded anything when one is well
the country was the grandest that can be imagined
so lonely and so solemn with sade grat clouds above and no sound save lost lamb leading upon the mountainside as though was little hart were breaking
each must cry louder and wer fathers yet may lu bew with them both that they may find their own at nightfall
i had no money but if i could only finde workable country i might stocky it with bowed capital and k consider myself a made man
there was no one in the whole world who had the smilest idea save those who were themselves on the other side of it if indeed there was anny one at all could i hoped to cross it
i would try the near arrange and see how far i could go
shortly after passing one of these chapels we came suddenly upon a village would started up out of the mist and i was alarmed less i should be made an object of curiosity ord dislike
my guide however were well known and the natural politeness of the people prevent them from putting me to any inconvenience but they could not have eyeing mean nor i them
the streets were narrow and una it but veryain fairly clean
the vine grat side many of the houses and there were some with sign boards on which was painted a bottle and the glass that made me feel much at home
even on sledge of human society there was a stunted growth of shops which had taken r and vegetative somehow though as in an air conte of the blest
each feature was finished el lids e lashes and ears being almost invariably perfects
their expression was divine and as they glanced to me timidly but with parted lips and great bewilderment i forgot all thoughts of their conversion and feelings that were far more earthly
even a middle age they were still comely and the old great hair women at their cottage doors had a dignity notes majesty of their own
the menu as handsome the women beautiful
i have always delighted in and reverenced beauty but i felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type a compound of all that his bestest in egyptian greek italian
the children or infinite in number and exceedingly mary i need hardly said that they came in for their fu share of the prevailing beauty
i expressed by signs my admirations i pleasure to my guides and they were greatly pleased
the country was highly cultivated every ledge you being planted with chestnuts wala and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering
i saw out a few sheep would rounded noses and enormous tiles
in about four hours a walking from from the time we started and after passing two or three more villages we came upon the a considerable town and my guides made many tempts to make the understand something but i gathered no angling of their meaning excepted that i needed be under no apprehension of danger
sufficed that i found myself taken before the chief magistrate and by his orders was placed in an apartment with two other people who were the first ii had see looking anything but w handsome
in fact one of them was plainly veryain much out of health and ceded violently from from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppressed
the other look pale and ill but he was marvelously self contained and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him
they felt my pulse they looked to my tongue they listened my chest they felt al my muscles and at the end of each operations they looked at the cheap and nodded and s something inn quite pleasant as though i were all right
but by a by they came to myer watch which id hidden way in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search
again there was a very old carriage whose wheels in spite rust decay i could see had been designed originally for iron rails
we passed many cases and at last came no one in which there were several clocks of two or three old watches
the des was diffrent but the thing was clearly the same
head some affecting calming him
he began presently to relent and spoke to me in the kinder manner
imagine there was several kinds of old fashion christmases but could hardly be worse than at chid my chambers or horror of horrors at the club or my cousin lucy's notions of what she calls the festive season
festive yes
the reply was written in a spling feminine hend it was a little vague
it appeared that the terms would be five guineas but there was an no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover
the whole thing was a tripod
there was nothing set about the sort of accommodations which would be provided nothing about the kind of establishment which was maintained or the tablet was kept
now it is a remarkable thing that ive have always had an extraordinary predilections for the ne med i doe not know why
i have never known a mag and yett from my boyhood upward i have desired to meet one
under such circumstances she was hardly likely to be lily herself but her name was mag and it was the accident of her christian name which decided me to go
i had no allusions
i did not expect a princely entertainment
all night it had been blowing and raining
i felt quite lively myself as i mingled with the christmas crowd looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous
i even bought something forage are i mean missus wilson
it' was a horrible journey
he was impervious to reason
it is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that i made at warm for the officials however cold i might have been myself
when at last i reached crofton my journey's end who turned up that the stations staff consisted of a half wooded individual who was stationed master porter and clerk combined and a hulking lad who did whatever else there to do
no one had come to meet me the village was but half a mile and hanger deen the house for which my steps were bent about four miles by the road how far it across cloud fields my informant did not mentioned
there was a trap at the boy and blunderbuss but that required fetch
when the trapped it appear it looked to me uncommonly like an opened spring cart
in it i was deposited with my luggage
i did not know what he meant
i did nots i was beyond it
i was chill to the bon wet tired hungry
i had long been wishing at an old fashioned christmas had been completely extinct before i had thought of adventuring in quest of one
here we be that might be so
there be the door in front of vie ye go up three steps if you can find him
there's a knocker if none of e hevening twisted it off
they are appeared to be no knocker though whether it had been twisted off was more than i could say
no answer th i allowed more than decent interval
better ringing again suggested the driver hard
maybe there up to some of their games and once rousing
the bell reverberated through what seemed like at empty house
presently feet were heard advancing along the passage several pairs it seemed and i light gleaming through the window overt the door
a voice inquired who is there
the informations was greeted with what sounded u commonly like a course of laughter
there was a rush of retreating feet and expostulating voice then darkness again and silence
who lives here on the people mad
i told the bell again
after a vast amount of unfastening the door was opened and on that threshold there stood a girl with lighted candle in her hand
i mister christo her from london
we lost the key of the cellar and there's nothing out except water and i don't think you'd care for that
her fathers a most remarkable person to say the least
but it is quite plaint to me that all the arrangements from for my wedding are going to be made by the snows
i d do not know when it is going to be but it will be either next week or the week afterpart l at the earliest possible moment and i shouldn't be at all surprised to learn that all mary end's things have been already bought and perhaps some of the marked
it is most delightful
it might just as well be someone else his wedding so u important is the part which i am s to play in it
for instance look at there behaviour in the matter of the ring
the accident in questioned occurred upon the sunday evening
the girl is fading but youd don't seem to notice it
i gasped positively guessed
that's it on of accounted
from a cousin of ours whose in that line
i nevers saw a people like the s mellings for possessing relatives in allsorts of lines
i was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a profit out of mar's en casement ringing but i handed over the amount
it is f from her actions in that matter that my suspicions springs
there shews a cottage or it may be a pin sty for all i know
when she heard of my engagement with mary anne she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honey moon in her cottage or pigs and that i should pay her rent fort it
there were no signs of faltering about her flow of language
i found that is a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations
it turned out that she had a little money of her own about a hundred and thirty pounds a year
and of course i had my expectations and she had hers
it was plain that together we should manage most comfortably delightfully in fact
i shall make papa give me five hundred pounds at least
a bird in the handes worth two in a bush and it will be something to have bys
i know what mamma can afford to give and i will see if she gives it
and i will see that there is no shirking about the boys or about the girls either
i have draw up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present and i shall tell them what they ought to givee it won't be my fault if i don't yet it
of course there are some people with whom you can't be perfectly plain but i shall be as plain as i can there's away and a manner of doing that kind of thing
hers has been prodigious
she has a knack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants which is a little short of miraculous
i notice that they are generally persons who have already tendered their offerings
the fact of having given mary a wedding present seems to fill them with a feeling of rancorous acidity which to me as inexplicable
such as the selfishness of human nature
but why that accounts they should pity me i altogether failed too understand
we have all been giving marne presence and i suppose you mister widing have beens giving her something too
that was what missus mick farce and said to me only the other day
and what inquired missus mac person has marian given you her love
someone snored
i cannot pretender explain why except on the suppositions that romances dead it least in that circle of society in which the snelling s move
as it is unless i a mistaken some of the rending will be on o side and they know it
pius the cards are out for the wedding
wear going for a honeymoon to eerily and the south of france
a second cousin of mary ends is in the cooks toss line
he has given us free passes all the way to the end of our journey and all the way back again and coo ponds for free board and lodging at the hotel it's a wedding present
besides which we can always sell the coops and railway passes which we don't use
he was young no spear had touched him no poison lurked in his wine
i tell you it is not poison she ceded
since his birth he hasp been guarded so closely that the cleverest poisoners on of the ease couldn not reach him
as you will know there are ten men and ten women whose so duty is to taste his foods and wine and fifty armed warriors guards chamber as they guarded now
low confused m wean
the man shrugged his broad shoulders and turned back into the arabas chamber
this man was clad in a browne camel here rob and sandals and a green turbine was on his head
not until the heavens were in the proper order could they performed this nec riman sey

the slant of the moon pressed evil for the ken of via the stars are inter moil the serpent in the house of the elephant
point of contact inquired the other
all discarded portions of the human body still remain part of it attached to it by intangible connections
but at the urgent entreaty of the princes of casa who loved buon a chant viny he gave her a lock of his long black hair as a token of remembrance
by which a soul is drawn from its body and across gulfs of echoing space returned the man on the mat
on the days under the golden dome the king ceded out again racked by awful parsons
they seek to snap the silver cord that bes me to my dying body
the cluster around me their hands are talent their eyes are reid like flame burning in darkness
they thing sere me like fire
i know now but brings me to the p
there they strove to break the silver cord of life and thrust my soul into the body of a foul nay wee their sorcery summed up from hell ah
your cry and the group of your fingers brought me back but i'm going fast
there was the older imperious note in his failing whisper
you have never disobeyed me oh ping my last command
send my soul creed youre
they also found a martian calender the year had been divided it into ten more or less equal months and one of them had been dah
ble tanner is logs he been going deeper and deeper into the olds sea bottom of syt
that took the centre of interest away from archology and started a new burst of activity
the civilian specialist in other fields and the space force people who had been holding take lines and making sketches and snapping camers were all flying to lower ser to find out that home much oxygen there was and what kinds of life had supported
they had fore five species of what might loosely be called birds and something that could easily be classed as a reptile and a carnival the size of a cat with birdlike claws and a herb wm most identical with the pig like thing in the big dark hao a mira and an mothers like a gaze with a single horn in the middle of its forehead
the daily news cas from from terror showed a corresponding shift in interest at home
toadies found the martians
it was locked for from the inside and we had burn it down with a torch that's where they are
glorious standish who had dropped in for lunch was on the mine fairly screaming into a radial ow extensions doesn't an a of them
well of course their dead what i questioned
martha remembered the clothes door on the first survey they hadn't attempted opening it
now which was burned away at both sides and lay still hot along the edges on the floor of the big office room in front
a flood bight was on in the room inside and lad was going around looking at things while the space force officer stooder by the door
mass suicide that's what it was notice whats in the corners
yes charcoal
so they just came in here and lit the charcoal and sat drinking together till they all fell asleep
the terran public wed to hear about martians and if live martians couldn't be found a roomful of dead ones was the next best thing
tony latimer the discoverer was beginning to cash on his attentions to gloria and his ingratiation would s he was always either making voice and imaged talks were tells or listening to the news from from the home planet
without questioned he had become overnight the most widely known archologist in history
not that im interested in all this form myself he disclaimed afterdeck from from terror two days afterism
bringing it to the public attention dramatis it

tom's eyes focus in horror on the wreckage in vel by stilled billowing dust

the young in viner had just noticed his friend lying pin beneath a heavy beam near by
his friend's e lids flickered

they picked their way through the wreckage and emerged on a scene of frightful destruction

and the only truck we had available was in that burning shed the superintendent added bitterly
anyhow we want to help got a job force
within minutes tom was in charge of clearing away rubble and extricating anyone who might be trapped inside the buildings
the telephone line was soon repaired and a steady stream of rescue vehicles began arriving from harness fire trucks three ambulances and private cars driven by volunteers
the two girls were as much have said as tom's mothers tom laughed
misters swift came into the living room jest then and told tom how worried missus swift and sandy had been
he smiled guiltily he added but i must admit i was more than a little concerned myself

when at last the queen gave birth to a daughter the king was so overjoyed that he gave a great christening feast like of which had never before ben known
one of the young fairies overhearing her and fancying she might works some mischiefs the little baby w and hin herself behinde the hangings in the hall so as to be able to have the last word and und any harm the old fairy might wish to work
the turn of the old fairy had now come and she declared while her head shook with malice but the princess should pierce her hand with spindle and die of the wound
it is true i cannot entirely und what my elder has done
now fifteen years after the princess was borne she was with the king in queen at one of their castles and as she was running about by herself she came to a little chamber at the top of the tower and there sad and honest old woman spinning but she had never heard as the king's ed it
she had no sooner taken up the spindle then being hasty and careless she pierced her hand with the point of it and fainted away
he knew that she would not awake for a hundred years
one said it was an enchanted castle another that withes this there but most believe that it was occupied by great ogre which carried thither all the children he could cat and e them upo wed a time for nobody could get at him through the wood
the young prince at these words felled himself on fire
scarce m had he come to the wood when all the trees and thorns which had made such an im penna abble thicket opened on one side in the other to offer him the path
he entered a large four cod and stoodst still with amazement all
but the faces of the men were rosy and the goblets by them had a few drops of wine left
he entered the guard room there the guards stood drawn up in mine with carbines at their shoulders but they were sound asleep
he passed through one apartment after another where were ladies and gentleman sleep in their chairs or standing
i waited mong fort you
i tal for four hours and it not then said half that was in their heads to say
meanwhile all the rest of the people in the castle had beene awakened at the same moment as the princess and they were now extremely hungry
but lady and waiting became veryain impatient and at length the nouns to the princess that they alway for her
then the prince took the princess by the hand she was dressed in great splendour but he didn not h that she looked as he had seen pictures of his great grandmother look he thought her all the more charming for that
the violins and ho boys played old but excellent pieces of music and afterism no time the grand almoner married the royal lovers and the chapel of the castle
he turned to showed them the castle but behold

at the time mary had noted nothing of these things now she saw them all alice for the first time in my nut to tail while slowly she went up the stair and through the narrowed ways and heard the same wind that raved alike about the newe grave in the old house into which latter for all the bales banked against the walls if found many a chink of entrance
when she opened the door that the bright fire which being undesired had kindled there startled her the room looked unnatural uncanny because it was cheerful
she stood for a moment on the hearth and in sad dreamy mood listened to the howling swoops of the wind making the house quiver and shake
this was her dream as nearly as she could recall it when she came to herself after waking from it with a cry
she was one of a large company at a house for she had never been before a beautiful house with a large garden behind
it was a summer night and the guests were wandering in and out at will and through house and garden amid lovely things of all colors and os
but she knew nobody and wandered alone in the garden oppressed was something she did not understand
at the end of that she was in a place of tombs
she entered and the servants soft fitted in silent were busy carrying away the vessels of hospitality and resting order as if already they prepared for another company on the morrow no one heated her
she was lust last utterly with an eternal loss
she knew nothing of the place had nowhere to go now where she wanted to go had not a thought to tell her what questioned to ask ifs she met a living soul
but living soul there could be none to meat
she had lost him years and years before and now she saw him he was there and she knew him
he came too her side and she gave him no greeting
i know it and there is no waking
the old time was but a thicker dreamed and this is truer because more shadowy
her only life was that she was lost
shall i pour out my soul into the ear of the mist of fe from my own brain
thus was she born away a captive of her dead neither willing nor unwilling of life and death equally careless
w bac came a ping of intense paine
she herself should have been the poem a alaric in a white gown and green scarf coming to him through the long grass under the blossom bows
her hands should have been full of blue bells and she should have held them up to his face and maidenly defence as he sprang forward to take her in his arms
you see that she knew exactly how tress is conducted in the pages of the standard poets e of the cheaper wiggly journals
she had to the fool them it alowed of her reading in her environment the literary sense
and curiously enough she was hardly curious at all ab what he might have to say
she only wished for may and the orchard instead of january and the dingy dusty waiting room the plain faced preoccupied travellers the dim desolate weather
the setting of the scene seemed to her all important
it was bitterly call but the embankment was mom than a railway carriage
he had been late he had offered no excuse no explanations
but here the only thing that occurred to her was to stop and looking one of the shops till he should ask her what she was looking at
the keen wind thrust itself even inside the high color of her jacket
her hands and feet were aging with cold
she would have shared his sorrow and showed herself half wife half angel from heavens in this dark hour
she said how frightful we called the is
and yesterday had a letter from her and she seems to expects to think and i thought to tell you u darling
a shock of i u believe a b relief tingle through hers who p was all what wasp with her fears
what opinions what he formed the purity of her minded the innocence of her soul if an incident like this failed to shock her deeply
following m tingle of relief came a sharp sickening pinch of jealousy and mortifications these inspired her
i don't wonder you were afraid to tell me she began you don't love me you've never loved me i was an idiot to believe you did
those four true words wounded her more than all the rest
couldn't help it then how can i ever truste
do you think i not sorry now
no it's only painful bot of us
i didn't think decent man c do such things she was pulling on her gloves go hm and glow over at all

the last strains of the ill treated ill fated intermezzo had died away and after them had died away also the rumbling of the wheels of the murder spar organ that had so gaily executed that along with the nin other tunes of its repit to the admirations of the house made at the window of the house opposite and the crowing delight of the two baby's next door
the young man drew a deep breath of relief and lighted the wax candles in the solid silver candle sticks on his writing tablet for now the late summer dusk was falling that ordinances heavens made fool the leasure of the days appointed torture
then there was silence than a sigh and the sound of light moving feet on the gravel
and again he listened with a quiet pleasure

there is a seat in the garden at the side of the house again shee hesitated
than she turned towards the quarter indicated and disappeared round moral bushes

it surely a terrible storm outside said the merchants eldest daughter as the window rattled the tiles of the roof and the rain beaton torrents against the doors and windows
he is old as well as poor she said

but we should not forget o promise to our father cried the youngest daughter
however in spite of all she could say the elder sisters opened the door and admitted the bigger

then she heard him good down the stairway and unbolt the heavy doors which led into the store

the merchant's daughter at first did not answer but as he kept u calling to her she finally asked him what it was that he wanted
i promise you i will do you no harm
you shall not come into my father's house
hast the charm out to me then said the robber
when she returned his hand was sticking through the whole door
the cries and purses of the robbers filled the air
they tried in vain to break down the great doors
all my worries about you were foolish
he had little enough to break or bite and once when there was a great famine the land he could hardly procure even his dey bread and as he lay thinking in his bed one night he sided and said to his wife what would will become of us
how cy feet our children when we have no more than we can eat ourselves
o you simpleton said she then must off for die of hunger you have had better plain the coffins for us
but she left him no past till he consented saying ahhh but i shall miss the poor children
and as soon as their parents had gone to sleep he got up put on his coat and unbarring the back door went d out
ah fathers said handsome i am looking up my white cat sitting upon the roof of the house and trying to say good by
but in reality hansome was not looking at a cat but every time he stopped he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path
but her husband felt heavy at heart and th it were better tore the last crossed with the children
early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled the out of bed and gave an e s lace of bread which was stills smaller than the former piece
we are going into the forest to hu would and in the evenings when were ready we will come in fetch you again
hence thought the roof tasted veryain nice and so he tor off a great peace while rhea large round pain out of the window and sat down quite contentedly

the old woman behave very avery kindly to them but in reality she was aped old which who waylay children and bott the bread house in order to entice them men but as soon as they were in her power she killed them cooked them mate them and made a great festival of the day
then she took up ha sol with her rough hand and shut him up in a little cae with a latest door and although he screamed loudly it was of no use
hel began to cry but it was all useless for the oldwit made her do ass she mounted
behold she cried an a passion get some water quickly the handsome fatter lean this morning i will killing cook him
dear good' god helps now she prayed
creep said the witch and see if it is hu enough and then we will put in the bread but she intended when great h got in to shut up the oven and l her bake so that she might e her as well as handsome
see i could even get in myself
and she got up and put her head into the oven
and now as there was nothing to fear they went back to the witch's house where an eery corner were caskets ful of pearls and precious stones
then they began to run and rushing into the house they fell upon their father's neck
not having heard from captain bick for some little time randal thoughted desirable and sidney's interest to make inquiries at his club
the sailing master announced that he had orders to take the vessel back to her port with no other explanations than that the crews was overs
this alternative in the captain's plans terminating the voyage a month earlier than his arrangements had contemplated puzzled ranal
randal waited while in london on the chance said py dic might pay him a visit
he is staying at this hotel to try the air of side them and he finds that agrees within him
had her beauty fascinated him
randal wr to accepting invitations determining to present himself before the appointed hour and to questioned catherine privately without giving her the advantage over him of preparing herself for the interview
after months of separations he received a visit from herbert
he you distressed me herberts more than words can say
he drank the wine greedily
whatever reviving effected might otherwise had produced on him it made no change in the threatening gloom of manner
he put downed the empty glass taking no notice of his brother's questioned
grandee he said you know where sneers
i will do neither the one nor the other
you don't know what it is to be used to seeing a pretty creature always nicely dressed always about the room thinking so much of you and so little of herself and then to be left alone as i am left out in the dark
i'm alone do you hear that alone
i haven't courage enough to do it from myself
oh why did i engaged that governess
i'm afraid he said
i tried that yesterday it' set my brains on fire i'm feeling that glass i took just now
he paused and put his hand to his fere head
was his mind wandering into some other train of thought
you can't do it
let me here what his first
i feel for you herbert he said warmly
she shall have your message all that i can do to persuade her shall be done
let me rest a little he pleaded if i'm not in the way
he mentioned the name of one of the olds servants mountain moran who had attached himself to randal after to the break of family
on the next day but one rand arranged his departure for side them so as to arrive at the hotel and hour before the time appointed for the dinner
the new number of a popular weekly journals had that day been published randall bought it
after reading one or two of the political articles he arrived that the cums specially devoted to fashionable intelligence
ranal looked again at the first words in the paragraph
with his own suspicions steadily contradicting him he arrived at the hotel obstinately believing that the charming widow would prove to be a stranger
missus norman and her little daughter where out driving with a friend and were expected to return in good time for dinner
missus presty was at home she was reported to be in the garden of the hotel
how nice of you to come soon she began
she added looking at him suspiciously
but you ought to have known that we are only half an hour behinde at side them in the matter of news
the reports premature my good friend
but if these newspaper people waited to find out whether report is tu false how much gossip with society get in its favourite newspapers
you are to understand the that catherine is a widow
sit down said missus presty
you shall hear how my divorce daughter and my poor little grandchild were treated at sandy seal
you would have seen her pining for the company of other children and would have had no mercy on her
he was introduced to missus norman and to missus norman's little girl and we were all charmed with him
when he and i happened to be left together he naturally wondered after having seen the beautiful wife where the lucky husband might be
and the captain of course concluded after having been introduced to kitty that missus norman was a widow
worse stories have been printed i do as sure you where stories have been printed
before i consented to answer the child's inquiries i came to an understanding with her mother'
honestly
after that i had her mother's authority for telling kitty that she would never see her fathers again
she asked directly her fathers was dead
that will do missus presty a defences thoroughly worthy of your conduct in all other respects
raddle pass this over without notice
a very wise decision she remarked
have you any message for captain bene deck
not at the hotel just now
it was a relief to randal in the present state of catherine's relations towards ben to return to london without having seen his friend
good by dear randal
arrived at the stations randal found that he must wait for the train
while he was walking upon down the plat form with a mind duly distressed by anxiety about his brother and anxiety about syne the trained from london came in
water you doing here he asked
you have been to the hotel he burst out you have seen catherine
we have both seem the same newspaper of course and you have been the first to clear the thing up that's it is in't it
not satisfied with gossip in private the greedy public appetite devours gossip and print and once more it than any one editor can supply
supposing the report had been true
in the meantime afterward missus presty had confessed the cruel falsehood which had checked po city's natural inquiries raised than in supper b obstacle to a meeting between fathers child
he had promised to do his best towards persuading catherine into grants sidney an interview
even the chance of successfully confiding her toby ex protections had lost something of its fair promise since randal was visit to side them
be the results however what they might randal could see but one plain course before him now
considerations of delicacy seemed to forbid taking this liberty even with an intimate friend
what happier future could await her especially she justified randal's pasted experience of all that was candid truthful inter characters then to become his friend's wifely
shall i say that she may expected early visit from you when i see her tomorrow
he added sidney's a dress and o postscript and despatched his letter that evening
but it might perhaps be excusable to infer that the marriage had not yet been decided on and that the captain's proposals were still waiting for catherine's reply
go do you here
but i lean five minutes the stir case grown beneath an extraordinary weight
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centered in his eyes which became blooded the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with e posey nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry
and the cry issued from his pours if we may th speak a cry frightful in it silence

the old man made side in the a fat
it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of what tier whose tears silently wor on his cheeks
but he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone
what was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corps
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed to the lips

now hc must needs poor forth for me and with her quire euralia must assist meat to putt inverse things difficulty to think
then back i turned my face to those high things which moved themselves towards us so sedately they had been been distance by new wedded brides
and i beheld the flame wights onward go leaving behinde themselves the a depicted and they of trailing penance had the semblance so that it overhead remained distinctly with sevenfold lists all of them of the colors whence the sun's bows made and deals girdle

the interval between these four contained a chariot triumphal and two wheels which by a griffin's neck came drawn alone

three maidens at the right wheel in a circle came onward dancing one so veryain redd that in the fire she hardly had been noted
