there's iron they say in all our blood and a grain or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
margaret said mister hale as he returned from showing his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thornton made his confession of having been a shop boy
or you don't mean that you thought me so silly
i really like that account of himself better than anything else he said
his statement of having been a shop boy was the thing i like best of all
you who were always accusing people of being shoppy at helstone
i don't think mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some part of what he said
his father dying in miserable circumstances
why it might have been in the workhouse
his father speculated wildly failed and then killed himself because he could not better disgrace
all his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
no one came forwards to help the mother and this boy
at least no friend came forwards immediately and miss thornton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
s they left milton
how tainted asked her father
o papa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade in making money
and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his iron nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
not vicious he never said that
improvident and self indulgent were his words
margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
however out it came
papa i do think mister thornton a very remarkable man but purse me i don't like him at all
am i do said her father laughing
first me as yee call it and all
i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
but good night child
there were several other science of something wrong about missus hale
she and dixon held mysterious consultations in her bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was a custom when any distress of her mistress called upon her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dixon lifted and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
but though she received presses and fond words back again in touch profusion as would have gladden her formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
she lay wet very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
a servant give dixon permanent assistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attention she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
visiting register officers seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she met bessy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
well busy how are you
better and not better if you know what that means
not exactly replied margaret smiling
i'm better in not being torn to pieces by coughing o nights but i'm weary and tired o milton and longing to get away to the landor boola and when i think i'm father and farther off my heart sinks none no better i'm worse
margaret turned around to walk alongside of the girl in her feeble progress homewards
but for a minute or two she did not speak
at last she said in a low voice
busy dish to die
bessy was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
not worse than many others are reckoned
but what was it
you know i'm a stranger here s perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton
i had forgotten when i said for the time conceded margaret quietly
i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margaret's softe and friendly gaze
as they turned up into a small court opening out into a squalled street bessy said
you will not be daunted to father's at home and speaks a bit groweth at first
but nicholas was not at home when they entered
cass bessy at last
bessy took a long and feverish draught and then fell back and shut her eyes
margaret bent ogres and said bessy don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or may have been
remember who gave it to you and made it what it is
now i'll not have my wench preache to
but surely said margaret facing round ye believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of laugh it was to be
i believe worse an normal
that's what i believe young woman
i don't believe all i hear no not by big deal
but whose come it last and who's welcome as long as who'll keep from preaching on what who knows not about
it's simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work
but the girl and y pleaded the mole was margaret
dumping hardly on him is a good man he is
i sometimes think i shall be marked with sorrow even in the city of god if other is not there
the feverish collar came into her cheeks and the feverish flame into her eye
but you'll be their father yee shall oa hart
she put her hand to it and became ghastly pale
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
presently the spasm that fore shuddered death had passed away and b he roused her soft and said
i'll go to bed it's best place but catching at margaret's gown yo'll come gain i know yo all but just say it
oh come to morrow said margaret
margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
she was late for tea at home

why i would apply to some good house mother to recommend me one known to herself or her service
very good but we must first catch our house mother
the mother of him spoke to us said margaret
mister thornton the only mother he has i believe said mister hale quietly
i shall like to see her she must be an uncommon person her mother added
perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
she sounded to be such careful economical person that i should like anyone out of the same family
my dear said mister hale all armed where don't go off on that idea
i'm sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
take notice that this is not my kind of fortunes papa if i have any at all which i own agree to or you always accusing me of it
i don't know positively that it is hers either but from little things i have gathered from him i fancy sir

dicky was well of questions but mister bey had no answers were them
nor was it sunday on which they took a rest and rushed their shirts according to mister bee's rule of life
they did not stay there but walked out across the downs where the skylights were singing and on a dip of the dance came upon great stone wards and towers were a strong and gray
what's that there said dicky
replied he of a truth i heard him not and i wot him not and folks are all sleeping
but she said whomsoever thou seest awake he's the reciter
then said the eunuch art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him
rejoin the eunuch who then was the reciter point him out to me
by allah replied the fireman i tell thee the truth
tell me what happened whats al makan
what ails thee then that thou must needs recite verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the fork are asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
and he also improvised the two following the tech
when nuzhat al zaman heard the first improvisation she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their wm home then she wept and cried to the eunuch and said to him woe to thee
he who recited the first time hath recited the second time and i heard him hard by
by allah an thou fetch him not to me i will assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee and yee shall beat thee and cast thee out
but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt
returned quickly and linger not
when it was the seventy third nine
but the yok said i will not leave thee til thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returning to my lady without him
now when the fireman heard these words he feared for z makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch by allah it was not i and they know him not
so go thou to thy station and if thou gave meet any one after this hour reciting aught of paltry whether he be near or far it will be i or someone i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me
then he kissed the enoch's head and spake him fair till he went away but a castrato fetched around and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
i say what made my ignoring what have the beater cup i drain far be from me thy land to flee nor will i bow to those who blame and for such love would deal me shame
then said the eunuch to z makan bees we with thee o my lord
o my lord continued the eunuch and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
we will do thee no upright o my son nor wrong thee in aught but our object is that thou bend th gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and returning weal and safety and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news
then the eunuch went out to z makan and said to him reside what verses thou knowest for my ladies here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition
and also these
then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fet
when the eunuch saw his case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
after awhile they came to themselves and zat al zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the kan and what had happened to her with the badawi how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother shakin and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of b how he had made their marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the king their sire had sent and asked for her from sharrkan
but now go to thy master and break him quickly to me
the chamberlain called the castrato and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the stockard till he found him in the rear of the caravan girding his ass and preparing for flight
she said it hath reached me auspicious king that when the stockard girded his ass for flight and bespake himself saying o would i knew what is become of him
i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence these pages at about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime
why didst thou say i never repeated these couplets nor do i know who repeated them when it was it thy companion
but now i will not leave thee between this place and that dad and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee
for as i feared the carmen hills discerning but unto allah we are all returning
then the eunuch cried upon you the pages saying take him off the ass
and he answered i am the chamberlain of the mere of damascus king sharrkan san of omar bin al du human lord baghdad and of the land of khorasan and i bring tribute and presence from him to his father in bagdad
so fairy forwards no harm shall befall you till you join his grand wazir th done
then he bade him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was trembling to the emir of damascus and was bound to king omar with presents and the tribute of syria
sit was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the king's son sharpen and may came sultan over his father's realm
and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet zay makan for quoth they his name be light of the place and he hath a sister nuzhat al zaman hies the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for alias and none wotteth what is become of them
so he turned to the wazir dandan and said to him badly your tale is a wonder of wonders
no o chief wazir that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions for let is almighty will restore it to you zaka and his sister nuzhat al zaman whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can
when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the twain and what befell them and the cause of their long absence
z w makan bowed his head awhile and then said i accepted the position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and sat him on the right way
then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharpen
after awhile the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of baghdad and khorasan a conquering host like the pool tied sea and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
when it was the seventy eighth night
any meat or rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place
lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zau makan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and sires san spere
moreover the sultan commanded his wazir then done call a ten days halt of the army that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain
he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days
what had happened to me
he asked himself something warm and living quickened me it must be in that neighbourhood
when however the gust was quite nigh and to them then did he heal tilly with human voice big in the midst of the kind and i heavily all of them had down their hates towards the people

and ever was in a better steering sip hooty specs ry and moderate weather
mister marble he ought to breathe was fairly nosing on the hin coops bringing him like the sailors as one might say very asleep
at that moment and a noise when a marriage seaman that of an oar falling in the boat
i think yet sell ho and close broad
he instruments of the seamen to require a second look and order to ascertain but it was to be none
on though they went three feet too hur two this gave up a moment of freezing time
as our seats were off flying forward and remained so for a few minutes be gave me leisure to look about
i soon saw both pros in glad enough was i should perceive that they had not prose interior near
mis the catt deserved it saw someone remarked that arm movements had been so prompted as to taint the rasp who was aback
a print of it still nit seceded
the prows did not alter the course but near nuts fast
i heard the rating the boarding pipes too as they were cut adrift from the spanker boom and fell upon the decks
kind went at and returned with three or four muskets and as many pipes
the still in its that r angled boot sides was might that of depth
the jan behaved beautifully he came round like tar
the question was now whether we could pass them or not for they got noon up to grand ble
and captain behaved perfectly win its critic muds and commanding at dead sim is in clots its intents int to his orders
now so board the jar chart
an nor sign we gave the gentleman the four ceases thout the news into stern most proverb which with deal near a tables length that is sent
they were night the yells of fiends in english
a doubt if we touches the man in the neer per
that state the ship pats ahead all her candidates being for leaving the poor mounting it in her wake
they swarmed up in fronty sherman's palings as thick as they could jam together and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise
some sung out pare down the fence tear down the fence
the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
sherwin run his eyes slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out gaze em but they couldn't they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
he average man's a coward
because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back in the dark and it's just what they would do
so they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with a hundred mast cowards at his back and lunches the rascal
you didn't want to come
but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness
now lead and take your half a man with you tails he is gone up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
the crowds washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harkness he heeled it after them looking tolerable cheek
he can't bat key careful
they argued an try to keep him out but he wouldn't listen an a whole show come to u his stan still
and one or two women begin to scream
so then the ring master he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse
it warn't funny to me though i was all but tremble to see his danger
and a horse a going like a house afire two
he shed him so thick that kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits
why it was one of his own men
and but never mind a rest of his outfit it was jest white but it was awful funny
the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and haw hot till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do it another time
twenty people sings out
the duke says yes
everybody sings out sold
but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on
just a word gentleman they stop to listen
what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up and sell the rest of the town
you bade it is the judge is right everybody sings out
we struck the raft at the same time' and in less than two seconds we was gliding downstream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
we never showed alight till we was about ten mile below the village
green horns flatheads
no i say is it don't
well it don't because it's in de breathe i reckon they're all alive
well that's what i'm a saying all kings is mostly raps guiding as fur as i can make out you dat so
and look at charleses second and lewis fourteen and lewis fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all them saxon hep darkies that used to rip around so in old times in rays gain
my you ought to seen old henry the eight when he was in bloom he was a blossom
ran up fair rosamond
well henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country
s'pose he opened his mouth what then
all i say is kings as kings an you got to make allowances
take em all around they're a mighty ornery light it's the way they're raised
well they all do jim
now to dope he's a tolerable like a man in some ways
this one's a middlin hard lot for a duke
when i waked up just at daybreak he was sittin there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and mornin to himself
it don't seem natural but i reckon it so
he was often moning in morning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying oh little liz'beth
don't you hear me shut dad dough
i lay i make you mine
jest as loud as i could yell
which was sound enough judgment but youd take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to howl
the king's duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy
why before he looked like the corner his old rip that ever was but now when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he'd walk right out of the ark and maybe was old vitiges himself
jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my pile ready
worry bound or young man
get aboard says the king
i done so and then we all three started on again
the young chap was mighty thankful cy was tough work toting his baggage such weather
he asked the king where he was goin and the king told him he'd come down a river and landed at the other village this mornin and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there the young fellow says
but then i says again no i reck'n it ain't him or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river you ain't him or you
no my name's oblige it alexander obliged reverend alexander oblige it i suppose i must say as i'm one of the lars poor servants
you see he was pretty old and george's good earls was too young to be much company for him except mary jane the red hitting and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didn't seem to care much to lit
too bad too bad he couldn't have lived to see his brother's poor soul
i'm going in a ship next wednesday for rio janeiro where my uncle l
but it'll be lovely wished i was a goin
mary james nineteen susan's fifteen and joanna is about fourteen that's the one it gives herself to good works and has a hair lip poy things
well they could be worse off
oh peter had friends an they ain't going to let them come to no harm
blame defeated acquire about everybody and everything in that blessed towns and all about the wilkes and about peter's business which was a tanner and about george's which was a carpenter and about harvey's which was a dissenter and minister and so on and so on then he says
when her deep they won't stop for a hail
was peter wilkes well off
when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got all
now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags
so then they waited for a steamboat
but the king was car he says
they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would they tell yee
they wanted them says kind of soft an jingle
phelps was one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look alike
i went around and climb over the back stile by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen
i out with a yes'm for i thought
so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
when we got there she set me down in a split bottom chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both my hands and says
well it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt
an i think he died afterwards he was a baptist
yes it was mortification that was it
your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you
you must have met him on the road didn't you oldish man with a
why child it'll be store
it was kinder thin eyes but i says
i had my mind on the children all a time i wanted to get them out to one side and pumped them a little to find out who i was
pretty soon she made the cold chill streak all down by back because she says
i see it warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
so i says to myself here's another place where i got to rest the truth
i open my mouth to begin but she grab me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes
children don't you say a word
i see i was in a fixt now
missus phelps she jumps for him and says
has he come no says her husband
i can't imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy
uneasy she says i'm ready to go distracted
he must have come and you've missed him along a road
oh don't distress me anymore i'm already distressed
why silas looky on up the road ain't that somebody comin
the old gentleman stared and says
i hain't no idea who is it
is tom sawyer
being time sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river
then i says to myself s'pose time sawyer comes dan'l ned boat
but i am h you please that you have seen my lady
i knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
her conversation has more charms than can be in mere beauty and a humour and disposition would make a deformed person appear lovely
why did you not send me that mews and a garland
why the best on is i have a squire that is as good as in night
in ernest we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish an occasion as i cannot tell which is strangers
all the people that i had ever and my life refused were brought again upon the stage like richard the third's ghosts to reproach me withal and all the kindness he's discoveries could make i had for you was late to my charge
my best qualities if i have any that are good served but for aggravations of my faults and i was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in this
tis a strange changed and i'm very sorry for it but i'll swear or not how to help it
mister fish is a squire of things and has so many mistresses than anybody may pretend to share in him in relieved that though i have the honour to be his near neighbour to speak freely i cannot brag much that he makes any court to me and i know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often
i think my youngest brother comes down with him
i can no sooner give you some little hints whereabout they live but you know them presently and ment you shall be beholding to me for your acquaintance
but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if i incline him to look graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
i have missed four fits and have had but five and have recovered so much strength as may be ventured to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
but besides i can give you others
i am here much more out of people's way than in town when my aunts in such as pretend and interest in me in a power over me do so persecute me with dear good nature n take it so ill that they are not accepted as i would live in a hollow trey to avoid them
you would think him altered and if it be possible more melancholy than he was
if marriage agrees noor better with other people than it does with him i shall pray that all my friends may escape it
well in earnest if i were a prince that lady should be my mistress but i can give no rule to anyone else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing their hearts to her may be infinitely taken with one i should not value at all for so there is a justinian wise providence has ordained it that by dead different humours everybody might find something to please themselves withal without envying their neighbours
the matter is not great for i confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best pleased never to be known in it on any occasion whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly avoided one must satisfy oneself by doing nothing that one need care knows
if i had a picture that will fit for you he should have it
or how can you talk of defying fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you could
i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am certain he knows utmost of the injuries you have received from her
we have had another to beat but much more calmly
then besides there was a time when we ourselves when different to one another did i do so then or have i learned it since
i have been studying how tom cheek might come by his intelligence and i very believe he has it from my cousin peters
how kindly do i take the civilities of your fathers in earnest you cannot imagine how his let appease me
would it would leave me and then i could believe i shall not always avocation for it
my poor lady vavasor is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against a protector and did not discover it
she has told now all that was told her but vows you will never say from whence she added we shall see whether her resolutions areas unalterable as those of my lady talmash
i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
i never saw anyone yet that did not look sinking and out of countenance now ever knew a wedding well designed but one and that was of two persons who had time enough i confess to contrive it and nobody to please in a itsel alving
the truth is i could not endure to be missus bride in a public wedding be made the happiest person on earth
do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather than fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
yet in earnest your father will not find my brother peyton wanting in civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters to me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set higher value upon her sister than she deserves
my aunt told me no longer garden yesterday that i was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome to heeded
you see i give you fir warning
by the next i shall be gone into kent and my other journeys laid aside which i am not displeased at because it would have broken intercourse very much
here are some bosses or colonies tell me how you like them
i told you in my last that my suffolk journey was made aside and i into kent hastened
if i drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will i bequeath all my kindness to you in it for a charge never to bestow it all upon another mistress lest my ghost rise again and haunt you
indeed i like him extremely and he is commended to me by people that know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than they i did not intend it so though i can assure you
i do not find it i am told i was so extremely when i believed you love me
but i am called upon
directed for your master
i see you can chid when you please then with authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded from a very good principle in me
we dare not that our tongues lie more on one side of our mouths and the other for fear of overturning it
you are satisfied i hope at this that i escape drowning
but i am troubled much you should make so ill a journey to soar little purpose indeed i writ by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters
how welcome you will be but alas
for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to no decay an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission
they laugh to hear me say that one unkind word destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase every day if it were possible but never lessen
we go broad all day and play all night and see our praise when weet time
while and silver earnest now i would not live thus a twelvemonths to gain all that king has lost unless it were to give it him again
will you be so good nature
he has one son it tis the finest boy that eerie saw and has a noble spirit but yet stands in that all of his father that one word from him is as much as twenty whippings
you must give me leave to entertain yourselves with discourses of the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
not to knowing you would come home i can assure you nor for any other kitchen or my own but with a cousin of mine that had long designed to make herself spot with him and did not miss of her aim
in my life i never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
ever since this adventure i have had some greater belief in all things for this nature that i could not forbear laying a peas caught with nine peas ino under my door yesterday he was informed by it that my husband's name should be thomas how you like that
she put her head down turned his good bed put her feet on the fender and took pottle into her lap all of it arrangements signified that something very important had got to be thought over and settled
the more proposal was the more breaded
after writed unlighted and maybe desist the consequence of that night's fun
just suppose it is true that he does ask me and i say yes
what a spiteful thing i among
i could to so much for all at home how i should enjoy that
that me see how can i begin
he has known her all her life and has a good influence over her
now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that week for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided she missed the pleasant little interviews there used to put a certain flavour of romans into her bark hot working days
i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments opposition that most attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected
it was that indiscribable something which women are quick to see and feeling men who have been pressed with wise and good mothers
this had an especial charm to polly for she soon found that this sight of his character was not shown to everyone
lately this had changed especially towards parley and it filled her more than she would confess even to herself
at first she tried to think she could that unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even gratitude
parley felt a very cordial friendship for mister sidney but not one particle of the love eef the only kind in which laugh can mutually paid
this finished polly's indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with the spies of the old eve in her composition
when saturday came polly started as usual for visit to back he and best the goodness resist stopping at the shores to leaving lily passel a fan that was calling time
a foolish little speech to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tender hearted girl trying to her duty
take hold of massa charley's hand miss maybe and wal pretty like willie and flossie said the mate
at the street corner a black eyed schoolboy was parting from a rosy faced school girl whose music wale he was reluctantly surrendering
how he got there was never very clear to puny but there he was flushed and a little out of bread but looking so glad to see her till she had not the heart a distaff and cool as she had fully intended to be when they met
shilly could not help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
that is the way i get to the was answered polly
she did not mean to tell but as fright this was so agreeable she forgot herself
but i know her better and i assure you that she doesn't prove she choice to mend her thoughts though she won't own it and to suppress you some day by the amount of heart and sense and goodness she has got
thank you no
h lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
asked the artful young man laying a trap into which polly immediately fell
he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being both wild and generous resolved to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as par lace his own
so and you made a last boy and remark he said quietly watching your face keenly all the while i thought so well i'm going out of towns on business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me annoy it
she thought she had a good deal of the coquette in her and i have no doubt that with time and draining she would have become a very dangerous one person but now she was far to transparent and straightforward by nature even to tell a white like lovely
he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorse for face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and accepted even servants
parley did not return to her favourite walk till she learned for minnie that the uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the ways or present after all
lugging too and for as usual what's the news with you
perhaps she chilled him
utterly done with and laid upon the shelf
minnie said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the bottles and that fuss above rebs
now don't be affected polly but just tell me like a dear has not he proposed
don't you think he means to
truly july fair
i don't mean to be prying but i really thought he did
oh i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have
i just gave him the hint and he took it
he meant to go away before that so them think his heart is broken or mind what did he gateless say
he understood and being a gentleman made no farce
but parry it would have been a grand thing for you
i'm not you know i prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days
never mind what the business was its surfaces to say that it was a good beginning for young men like town who having been born in bred in the most conservative class of the most conceited city in near england needed just the healthy hearty social influences of the rest to brighten his views and make a man of him
fortunately everyone was so busy with the necessity probations that there was no time for romans of any sort and the four young people worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not bottled up in their respective hearts
pity that the ends had come so soon but the hour did its work and rend its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind but the young foes did not see it them for their eyes within because of the partings that must be
if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a summer in town but sydney often called t his vacation came and a voluminous class bonds of parley beguiled belong days
time were at once a week to his mother but the letters were short in not very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women bess like to hear
no i'm only tired had a good dear to do lately and the doll weather mixed me chest a twel brew
forgive me polly but i can't help saying it for is there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can
ach i never deceive myself but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me
thank heaven for that
cried polly with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice
poor parley was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say
none were needed her held her face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish post which and the huns are after it
once or twice but sort of chokingly and i thought it was only some little flirtation
it was us you could of me not a guess before
it was so tender earnest and defiant but fanny forgot the defense of her own lover and admiration of police loyalty to hers for this faithful all absorbing laugh was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friends boast of two or three lovers a year and calculate their respective fair use with almost as much coolness as the young men discussed fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to mary
i hope maria bailey's only thinks s she added softly for i could not bear to happen disappointed again
said fanny turning hope for all at once
suppose i say a word at tom just inquire after his heart in a general a way you know and'll give him a chance to tell me if there's anything to tell
bear it people always do par things somehow answered polly looking as if sentence have been passed upon her
it was a very different window from the last above the girls
if anny wanted to show him what she could do toward making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded byre than she suspected for in spite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mister sidney at least for he was more the house friend than ever and seemed determined to prove the change of fortune made not difference to him
she kept much at home when the day's work was done finding it pleasanter to se dreaming of a book or soon alone than to exert herself even to go to the shores
polly was not at all like herself that window and those newest to her saw and wonder at it most
for ned was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole baily question and left them in other darkness
fanny came bragging in the pony one day looking as if she bou tidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them
but if work baskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any reread
she had even been in society before the revolution
it was her pleasure and her vanity to dragon these names on every pretext
every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monseigneur saint francois gave it monsignor s julian monseigneur saint julian gave it to monseigneur saint eusebius monseigneur saint acids gave it to monseigneur saint procopius et cetera et cetera
and the schoolgirls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under the veils charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers from
it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
the ruler of font devill did not forbid this
she would not show the subject to anyone
thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were on occupied or bored in the convent
some unique chaplet some authentic relic
they lost themselves in conjectures
who the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making an effort to fly but the dancers laughing with a satanic air
moral love conquered by the colic
the prioress returned and seated herself once more honor cure
we will present in a stenographic reports of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability
father for rent
reverend mother do you know the chapel
and you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties two or three times
there is a stone to be raised heavy
the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar
the slab which closes the vault yes
it would be a good thing to have two men for it
a woman is never a man
because dame mabel gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of saint bernard while merlin is hocus only gives three hundred sixty seven i do not despise merlin horses neither do i
marriage consists in working according to one's strength a cloister is not a dockyard

and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning
it was mother pris fiction
three years ago madame de bassoon a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen mother crucifixion a pair ah
the mothers have taken her to the dead room which opens on the church i know
a fine sight it would be to see a man entered the ed room more often
fay more often
what you say
i say more often more often than what
whether another i did not say more often than watch i said more often
but i did not say more often
at that moment nine o'clock struck
at nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours praised and dured me the most holy sacrament of the altar said the pores
it cut more often short
fuca not marked his forehead
in her lifetime by the crucifixion made converts after her death she will perform miracles she will
father fervent the commune has been blessed in mother p's fiction
she retained her consciousness to the very last moment
she gave us her last demands
if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in herself she would have cured your leg merely by touching it she smiled
there was something of paradise in that death
fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing
fauchelevent held his peace she went on
i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastic slavering in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit
fortunately the pores completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it
she continued further for them
yes rem mother
saint terentius bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on his toob might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides in the hope that passers by would spit on his tomb this was done
the dead must be obeyed so be it
for that matter no revere mother
father prevent mother crew's fiction will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years that is just
it is a continuation of her slumber
so i shall have to knew of that coin yes
i am at the orders of the very reverend city
the four mother p centers will assist you
no in law ringing the coffin
where into the vault
fauchelevent started the vault under the altar
under the altar but
you will have an iron bar yes but
you will raise the stone with the barrow by means of the ring but
the dead must be obeyed to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother crucifixion
she asked it of us that is to say commanded us
but it is forbidden
oh i am a stone in your walls
think father for then if she were to work miracles here
what a glory of god for the community and miracles issue from tombs
but reverend mother is the agent of the sanitary commission
but the commissary of police
chimu de mer one of the seven german kings who entered among the galls under the empire of contentious expressly recognized the right of nuns to be varied in religion that is to say beneath altar
the world is nothing in the presence of the cross
martin the eleventh general of the carthusians gave to his order this device stat crew doom ful at ter orbs
e priors who is usually subjected to the barrier of silence and whose rather wore was over full rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away

on one side saint bernard on the other the agent of the sanitary department
godson mated to the commissary of police such as the age silence fa want
no one doubts the right of the monastery chu sepulture
only fanatics and those in error deny it
we live in times of terrible confusion
we are ignorant and impious
and then mugen is attacked why
because there have been bad priests because sag tare bishop of cap was a brother of salon bishop of ambert and because both of them folded mama
they persecute the saints
they shut their eyes to the truth darkness is the rule
the most ferocious beasts our beasts which are blind
oh how wicked people are
by order of the king signifies to day by order of the revolution
one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead a holy death is prohibited
gauthier bishop of chillon held his own in this matter against otho duke of burgundy
the pores took breath then turned to fauchelevent
you will close the coffin the sisters will carry it to the chapel
the office for the dead will then be said
but she will hear she will not listen
besides what the christo knows the world learns not
a pause of suit
you will remove your bell

general observations on preserves confectionery ices and dessert dishes
the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious subjection for except a sugar is used in considerable qualities the success is very uncertain
which fit gathered in weather fogy weather will su be mildred and be of no service for preserves
but to distinguish these probably applies very great attention and considerable experience
if you dip the finger into the serf and the plight to the thumbs the tenacity of the serf will on separating the finger and thumbs afford a thread which shortly breaks this is the little thread
red it boil up again then take it off and move carefully the scum that is risen
it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil
before sugar was in use honey was employed person many vegetable productions though this substance was now humanly to the juice of the sugar cane
fourteen no d nine
bore them up three days successively stemming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use
the reason ly afford is emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
from this example the process of preserving fruits by sirup would be easily comprehended
they should be dried in the stove or oven on a seas and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they are turned
in this way it is also that orange and women ships are preserved
marmalades james and fruit pates of the same nature and are now in bay general quest
mar loads and jams differ little from each other their preserves of half liquid consistency mad by boiling the pulp of fruits i am sometimes part of the wins with sugar
that they may keep it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen o three
in all the operations for preserve making when the preserving pan is used as should not be placed on the fire but on a tribute unless the jim is mad on a hot plate when this is not necessary
confectionery fifteen o eight
in speaking of confectionery should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head for the various flutes flowers herbs loose and juices which one board with sugar were formerly employed in pharmacy as well as sweetmeats were called confections from the latin worth confer se to make up but the term confectionery embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary quinine
a thousand and more ornamental dishes that have done the tables of the wealthy should re purchase from the confectioner they cannot profitably be made at home
however as late as the reign of our two last george's fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts
the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems
ices
at desserts or at some evening parties ices are scarcely dispensed with
the s battle is generally made of copper kept bright and clean
they should be taken immediately after their repast or some hours after because the taking of these substances dulling the process of digestion is aptly provoke indisposition
there was once on the time a widower who had a son and a daughter by his first wife
from the very gave it the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the man's children and not a corner to be found that they could get any rest so the boy thought that the best thing he could do was to bellot into the world and try to earn his own bread
but his sister who was still at home fared words and worse
tis me go said bad
when the king entered and saw he stood still as if he were in fetters and could not stir from the spot for the picture seemed to him so beautiful
these promised to make all the haste he could and set forth from the tim's palace
at last they came in sight of land
while if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her task into the sea
what is my brother saying asked his sister again
on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchen maid who slept there to lend her a brush
she begged there prettily and got it and then she pushed her hair and the goal dropped from it
out on the ugly bushy bride sleeping so soft by the young king's side on sanding stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with the cold snake unpitied and
i shall come twice more and then never again said she
this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she sent the bell gout three times and when day dawned she departed but if she was going she said as she had said before i shall come once more and then never again
no one can tell how the light of the king was to get rid of that hideous bushy bride and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as day itself
wilt not serve me and wh my seven fools asked the king
the youth thought that it was very easy word to wash the fons and he could do well enough
hast thou watched faithfully and well the whole day long said the king when the lad came into his presence in the evening
yes that i have said the youth
he had gone out once to seek a place he said but never would he do such a thing again
the necking promised him the same punishment and the same reward fear polished his brother
when he had run after the fools for a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by a cleft in the rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with the distaff and she called to him
which come hither come hither my handsome son and let me comb your hair
the youth like the thought of this let the holds where where they chose and seated himself in the cleft of the rock by the side of the old hag
so then he sat with his head on her lap taking his ease to livelong day
on the third day set the light wanted the settee
the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go but all to no purpose when cinder lad set out on his way
i'm marking about and so to a place said cinder lad
i would much rather have the princess said cinder lad
and thus they journeyed onwards a long long way
when they had gone thus for a long long way the full again or us dost thou see anything now
yes now i see something that his wife said tinder lad
it looks like the chalk of a great thick birch tree
signor tri but could not do it so he had to take a drop on the pitcher and then one more and after that still another and then he was able to be over sword of perfect ease
for we are brother said the princess whom thou art to have when thou canst tell the king what we eat and drink but there is a mighty toll whose hast to spell over us
when they had ted a long long way the fore said dost not seem anything
and now on quiet a fole seest thou nothing now
now th said the fl dost thou not see anything now
that is a river said the full and we have to cross it
i have done my best replied sing lad
once upon a time there was a king in the north hope one many wars but now he was old
the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
so yes the queen how do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning and she said
then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
he is no bigger than other dragon said the tutor and if you were as greve was your father you would not fear him
then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dwarf who waned all the treasure and took it from him
on the one ring was left which the dwarf wore and even that was taken from him
so wigan made a sword and sigurd tried it with a blow and a lump of iron and the sword broke
then sigurd went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's blade and gave them to regan
so sigurd said that sword would do
then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley
but sigurd waited till half of him it called over the pit and then he thrust the sword graham right unto his very heart
sigurd said i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
but all men die and no brave man lets death frighten him from his desire
guy thou fafner and then staff ner died
then sigurd grote back and met reek and wigan asked him to roast baffin's heart and let him taste of it
sissy could put the heart of fafner on a stake and roasted it
there's cigaret roasting fafner her's heart for another when he should taste of it himself and learn all wisdom
that let him do then ride over hen feld to the place where brill sleeps
there must she sleep till thou comes for her waking rises up in ride for now sure she will swear the vow fearless a breaking
then he took the helmet off the head of the sleep red behold she was a most beautiful lady
then sigurd rode away and he came to the house of a king who had a fair daughter
lamborn hill's father told gunner that she would marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower and that they rode and got to fit his horse at the flame but he would not face it
for one day when burn hild and gudgeon were bathing brune held wave that farther sou into the river and said she did that to show she was gundry superior
for her husband she said had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it
not long to wait he said till the bitter sword stands fast in my heart and thou will not live long when i am dead
lobsters and lobsters
when is a lobster not a lobster when it is a crayfish
this question in answer might well go into the primer of information for those who com infancy governed east for what is called a lobster in s francisco is not a absurd at all but a crayfish
the pacific crayfish orestes every purpose and while many content that its meat is not so delicate flavour as that of its eastern cousin the californian was strenuously insists in it is better but of course something must always be allowed for the patriotism of the californian

i say come to san panzas co advisedly for while the crab is found all along the coast it is prepared nowhere so deliciously sence and bensa
goby is passed with the fire and the little restaurant bearing his same and in charge of his widow in union scrap anu has not attained the fame of the old place
it is possible that she knows the secret of preparing crab as it was prepared in the gobies of before the fire but his proceeds would not descend to her
gobies perhaps do
take the meat of one large crab scraping out all the back from the shell
soak to crab me in the sherry two eyes before cooking

i swear answered sancho
i say so continued don quixote because i hate taking away anyone's good name
i say replied sancho that i swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship stayed and g gretel to let it out to morrow
though your worship was not so badly of having in your ar seeing comparable beauty you spoke of and i what did i have except the heaviest wax that i think i had in all my life
unlucky me and the mother at berber
didn't i say so worse luck to my line said sancho
it cannot be the more answered don quixote but those under enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone
if they do not let themselves be seen they let themselves be felt said sancho if not let my shoulders speak to the point
mike speak to said don quixote but that is not a suspicion reason for believing that what we see is he enchanted more
the officer turned ro and said well how goes a good man
sancho got up with pain enough in his bones and went after the incubus in the dark in meeting the officer who was looking to see what have become of his enemy he said to him senor whoever you are do us to favor and kindness to give us little rosemary oil salt and white for it is water to cure one of our best nights errant on earth who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted more than is in this in
to be breathed he took the mats of which he made a compound mixing them on boiling them a good while it until it seemed to him they had come to perfection
sancho panza who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous begged him to give him what was let in epics in which was no small quantity
don quixote consented and he taking it with both hands and good faith and with the better will broke to down and dreamed a very little less than his master
if your worship knew that returned sancho won't betide me and all my kindred why did you let me taste him
search your memory and if you find anything of this kind you need only tell me of it and i promise you by the order of knighthood which i have received to procure you satisfaction in reparation to the utmost of your desire
then this isn't in said don quixote
in a very respectable one said the innkeeper
the cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his master who appalling to listen attentive to flee was persuaded that some new adventure was coming until he clearly perceived that it was his squire who uttered them
he saw him rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that had his rage aladdin is my belief he would have lacked
sancho took it and as he was raising into his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming sancho my son drink not water drinkin of my son for it will kill thee see here i had the blessed balsam and he held a clasp of liquor and with drinking two drops what thou wilt certainly be restored
the strides of a lain man like the og and glances of a one eyed man they do not reach their goal very promptly
cosette had waked up
jean valjean had paced her near the fire
you will wait for me at a lady's house i shall come to fetch you
everything is ranged and nothing is said fauchelevent
i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
that's where the difficulty lies
it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out
and she will hold her tell me i answer for that
fauchelevent grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean
you understand father madeline the government will notice it
jean valjean stared him straight toe i and thought that he was raving
fauchelevent went on
it is to morrow that i am to bring you in the prioress expects you
then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community
that the nun who had dined that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the fault under the altar of the chapel
that the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil wish of the deceased
that he fauchelevent was to nail up the coffin in the cell raised the stone in the chapel and blower the corpse into the vault
and then that there was another the empty coffin
what is that empty coffin
asked jean valjean fauchelevent replied
what coffin what administration
fauchelevent who was seated sprang up as though alma had burst under his chair you
you know fervor what you have said mother grease of fiction is dead
and i add and father madeline is buried r
you are not like other men father madeline
this offers the means give me some information in the first place
how long is the coffin six feet
it is a chamber on the ground floor has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one leads into the convent the other into the church a w church
the church in the street of the church which anyone can enter
have you the kings to those toodles
and no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the drawer which communicates with the catch
only to allow the undertakers men to enter when they come to get the coffin
who nails up the coffin i dy
who spreads the poor labor it
not another man except the police doctor can enter the bedroom that is even written on the wall
could you hide me in that ring to night when everyone is asleep
about three o'clock in the afternoon
or i shall be hungry ah i will bring you something
you can come a now me up in the coffin at two o'clock
fauchelevent recoiled and capped his finger joints but that is impossible
bah impossible to take a hammer and drives nails in a pan
jean valjean had been worse straight the miss
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to conon rise his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean's gloomy talons
you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nay on the top plank p on loosely good and what if you should happen to car for to sneeze
a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze
who is there who is not said to a cat do come in
the over prudent cats as they are and because they are cant sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
but jean valjean's cornet prevailed over him in spite of himself he grumbled
if you are sure of coming out of the coffin right i am sure of getting out of the grave
and u the old school the grey digger puts the corpses in the grave and i put the gravedigger in my pocket
i shall follow that is my business
there's halts undertake his men not a rope around your coffin film lower you dam
the priests as the payers makes the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
one of two things will happen he will either be so but or he will not be sober
that is settled father fauchelevent all will go well
on the fallen day as the sun was declining the very rare passers by on the boulevard du men pulled off their hats to an old fashioned hearse ornamented with skulls glass bones and tears
this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a hinge corpse with drooping arms
a morning coach in which could be seen a priest in his surplice and a choir boy in his red cap followed
behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer limped along
the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter in this cemetery they were subjected to a special discipline
these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalid
dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it
the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the ro gerhard it hinted at poverty calashes if fe peas
to be buried in peril is is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognized as elegant
the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the introduction of jean valjean into the dead room all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch let us rob in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly vial offense in our sight
it is one of the faults which resent on a duty
the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences
in the cloister what is called the government is only an intermeddling with authority an interference which is always questionable
make as many nos as you please men but keep them for yourselves
a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind
jean valjean's composure was one of those powerful tranquillity which are contagious
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
he played with father misti and
he did what he lacked with him he made him dance according to his wing
the permission for interment must be exhibited
he was a sort of laboring map who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm
the man replied the gray digger
the wave dinner yes
you i
father miss janus the grave digger he was
flushing of what had expected anything but this that a grave digger could die
it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do die themselves
he had hardly the strength to stammer
but he persisted feebly father mer is the grave digger
do you know who little fatherland lyres he isn't job of red wine
but you're a jolly fur
are you not comrade we'll gun have a drink together present
the man replied
he limped more out of anxiety than from infinity
the gravedigger walked on in front of him
fauchelevent passed the unexpected crabbe once more in review
fauchelevent who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
sir father nastier is dead
the man replied completely
the good god consulted his notebook which shows when the time is up it was farthermost young's turn p misti and died
stammered fauchelevent it is made
you are a peasant i amy parisian
fresh she won thought i am lost
there were only a few terms of the wheel distant from the small ey leading to the nun's corner
and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well
fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter rains clog at the wheels and retarded its speed
my father was a porter at the brittania tal hon
but he had reverses he had losses unchanged i was obliged to renounce the profession of author but i am still a public writer
but so you are not a grave digger then
returned fauchelevent clutching at this branch feeble as it was
here a remark becomes necessary
a fauchelevent was at his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
the great digger went on with a superior smile
one must eat
the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake
yes but if i should already ask for something what
well do it for me for i swear to you i don't love you as the others have loved you
there are bolts on the door wretch
i don't know how it is but it's seems ton if i do
now go i can't keep my eyes open
it seemed to me as if this sweeping city belongs to me i searched my memory for the names of those whose happiness i had once envied and i could not recall one without finding myself the happier
education fly feeling the sense of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sentinels so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first castle of love all the more ardent because they seem so pure
the more girl believes in goodness the more easily will she give way if not to her lover and these to love for be without mistrust she is without force and to what her love is a triumph that can be gained by any young men of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must they find it tempting how surely must they listened to the first voice which comes to tell its secrets through their bars and bless the hand which she is the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil
with them the body has worn out the soul the senses half burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
they love by profession and not by instincts
when a creature who has all her past to reproach herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere irresistible love of which she had never felt herself capable when she has confessed her love how absolutely the man whom she loves dominates her
they know not to what proof to give
in order to disturb the labourers in the field was one day devoured by a wolf because those whom he had so often deceived no longer beliefs in his cries for help
this is the same with these unhappy woman would be love seriously
but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one draught all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
but to return to the first day of mal son
whenever each home i was in the state of mad gaiety
the woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him
how why
my whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night
here are my orders tonight at a vaudeville
ponder the third and trap
the boxes filled one after another
only one remained empty as stage box
at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and marguerite appeared
did she love me enough to believe that a more beautiful she lives the happier i should be
what is the matter with you to night said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
he should go to bed she replied with that ironic era which went so well with her delicate and witty face
where at home
you still love me can you ask
because you don't like seeing him
now the less i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and marvelling again into the carriage which was wading for them at the door
i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
you in the way marguerite but how
well you might have had a woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive
during this remark marguerite looked at me attentively
my dear prudence i answered you do not know what you are saying
yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
because i am watched and the least suspicion might to me the greatest harm
is that really the only reason
if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
on the sleet you care for me a little a great feel
i fancied for a moment that i might give myself that happiness for six months you would not have it you insisted on knowing the means
well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
i listened and i gazed that marguerite with admiration
when i thought that this marvellous creature whose feet i had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts by part in her life and that i was not yet content with what she gave me i asked if ma's desire had indeed limits when said spied as probably as mine had been it reached after something further
truly she continued we poor creatures of chance have fantastick desire and inconceivable loves
we are not allowed to have hearts and the palsy of being hooted down and of ruining our credit
we no longer belong to ourselves
who stand first in their self esteemed last in their steam
never do we give you advice which is not lucrative
it means little enough to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they get dresses or a bracelet out of them and that they can drive and o paris from time to time or come to our box at the future
such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and old ages neither protects nor consoles
i thought i could upset the life which he offered me but what would you have
what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
marguerite hired out with it long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough pull up her the cheek to her lips and from that to her eyes
marguerite do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but in the name of heaven tear up the letter which i wrote to you and did not make me leave you to morrow it would kill me
marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
here it is i have brought it back
i tore the letter into fragment and kissed with tears the hand i gave it me
look here prudence do you know what he wants said marguerite
he wants you to forgive him
one has to but he wants more than that what then
i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled
oh mister buzzard grinned
this sounded like another story
he was curious about that black headed cousin of all mister buzzard very curious indeed
anyway he would find out
please mister feler please tell us the story he begged
now all mister buzzard is naturally good natured and accommodating and when peter bagged so hard he just couldn't find it in his heart to refuse

yes saw she show he was plum scared

when he get home he tan try to brush this suit off but it done get into the skin and it stay there
a little sigh of satisfaction went round the circle of listeners
it was just as good as one of grandfather frogs

it was an extremely difficult task and i was anxious to observe all the niceties apart which i had learned so as not to lapse into some error

i begged his most less purse excellency to name a single person why had ever taken in
i said my lord i thank you and beg you to condescend so far as to listen to four words it is true that he lent me a pair of old scales two anvils and three little hammer which articles i begged his workmen giorgio d corona fifteen days ago to fetch back

when he had heard this speech the duke rose up in anger and sent for bernard who was forced to take flight as far as venice he antonio landy with him
you had better put this to the proof and i will go at once to the barge ello
i am willing to enter into competition with the ancients and feel able to surpass them for since those early days in which i made the meddles of pope clement i have learned so much that i can now produce far better pieces of the kind i think i can also outdo the coins i struck for duke gal sandro which are still held in high esteem in like manner i could make for you large pieces of gold and silver plate as i did so often for that noble monarchs king francis of france thanks to the great conveniences he allowed me without ever losing time for the execution of colossal statues or other works of the sculptor's crafte

among artists certain in raged sculptors laughed at me and called thee the new sculptor
now i hope to show them that i am an old sculptor if god shall grant me the boon of finishing my perseus for that noble piazza of his most lustrous excellency
having this excellent resolve and heart i reached my home
while there was rather surly after the ladies had floated away from the scene and he drank his liquor doggedly
it was his fancy i suppose to revive certain sentimental relations which had it may be once existed between him and miss lake and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnified an object in proportion as its pursuit is thwarted
the story of friedlin and wretch's pretty outlines
sit down beside me and i'll tell you the story
he assisted at it but took no part and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gabble and laughter like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance
but honest mark forgot that young ladies do not always come out quite alone and jump unassisted into their vehicles
but the middle son was little and lorn he was neither dark nor fair he was neither handsome nor strong
rowing himself on his knees before the king he cried o royal sire was still upon me also a sword in his steed that i may up and wait to follow my brethren
but the king laughed him to scorn thou a sword he
in sooth thou shalt have one but it shall be one befitting th maiden size and courage yet so small a weapon can be found in all my kingdom
forthwith the grinning jester began shrieking with laughter so that the bells upon his motley cap were all set a jangling
i did but laugh to think the sword of ethelried had been so quickly fouled responded the jester and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailor's girdle
one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes
thou shalt have thy liberty he cried even though thou shouldst run me in pieces the moment thou art free
it had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful fairy with filmy wings which shone like rainbows in the moonlight
at this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten
scissors grow a giant's height and save us from the ogres might
he could see the ogre standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the chasm and gnashing his teeth each one of which was as big as a mill still
his sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him
what thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this dismal spot while i have the power to help thee
he lifted the scissors and with one stroke destroy the web and gave the flies read him
a faint glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole
the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors
as he uttered the words the scissors leaped out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shutters as easily as through the cheese
in a very short time the prince had crawled to the opening
while he stood looking around him in bewilderment a firefly alighted down his hart flashing its little lantern in the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me to guy do to a place of safety
what has to become of me cried the poor peasant
my grain must fall and rot in the field from over ripeness because i have not the strength to rise and harvest it then indeed must we all starve
the grand dame whom he supplied with bags the merchant whom he rescued from robbers the king's counsellor to whom he gave aid all became his friends up and down the land beggar lord homeless wanderer high born day he gladly gave unselfish service all had sought and such as he helped straightway became new friends
to him who could bring her back to her father's castle should be given with throne and kingdom as well as the princess herself so from far and near indeed from almost every country under the sun came knights and princes to fight the ogre
among those who drew back were ethel's brothers the three that were dark and the three that were fair
but ethel read heeded not their tops
so they all cried out long and loud long of the prince princesse
he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn open with the iron in order that grain may be deposited within it it feels only the wound the quiver of the germ the joy of the fruit only arrived later
he thought just acquire the faith must he then reject it already
he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubts and he began to doubt in spite of himself
to stand between two religions from one of which you have not as yet emerged in another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to that like souls
marius was clear eyed and he required the true light
the half lights of doubt tamed him
whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
his discomfort was augment by all the reflections which occurred to him
in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
they soon elbowed him abruptly
request crac to come and talk with me said marius
what is to become of you said courfeyrac
what are you going to do i do not know
silver gold here it is
you will then have only a pair of trousers a waistcoat a hat and a coat and by boots
that will be enough
no it is not good what we do after that
you know german no
it is badly pain work but one can live by it
the close dealer was hen for
he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments they went to the watchmakers
he bought the watch for forty five francs
hello i've forgotten that said marius
the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot
i have ten francs left said marius
that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sous very slowly
one morning on as return from the lo school murrays found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistol that is to say sixty hundred francs in gold in a sealed box
marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt with the respectable letter in which he stated that he had suspicious means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs
at that moment he had three francs left
he perceived that it was no good talking to the old man and that the principal person in the house was the mother
before her he decides this carter his pearls
the princess was distracted and did don't know what to do she felt she had sinned against k
well doctor decide our fate said the princess tell me everything
is there hope she meant to say but her loops quivered and she could not utter the question well doctor
as he waited the princess went out of the sigh
the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations
and there are indications monet rican nervous excitability and so on
the question says thus the presence of indications of tub at this process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
yes s an understood thing responded the celebrated physician again glancing at his watch
beg pardon is the y ski bridge dana or shall have the drag or on
he asked ah it is
oh well then i can do it in twenty minutes
and how about it to her abroad asked the count doctor
what is wanted is the means of improving nutrition enough lowering
the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
but in favor of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling epic
and then the mother wishes it he had
ah well not haste to be sure let him go only those dreaming quacks are mischievous
oh times up already n he went to the door
the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so that he ought to see the nation once more
oh no only a few didius princess come this way
and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing room to giddy
when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tears
she answered him and all at once got up furious
excuse me doctor but there is really no logic in this
this is the third time you've asked me the same thing
the celebrated doctor did not take offense
nervous irritability he said to the princess when she had left the room however i had finished
and the doctor began significantly explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which was certainly harmless
at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged into deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem
finally his decision was per nussed they were to go abroad but to put no faith in foreign quacks and to apply to him in any need
it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had young
the mother was much more cheerful as she went back to her daughter and kitty pretended to be more cheerful
educated people of the upper glosses are trying to stifle the ever brewing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social war
this is absolutely indirect
in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interest for the enters of the group
the champions of the social conception of life usually trying to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires
the basis of authority is bodily wiles
the possibility of applying bodily violence of people is provided above all by an organisation of armed men trained to act in unison and submission to one will
these bands of armed men said missa to a single will are accosted the army
the army has always been and still is the basis of power
power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything in court popularity of the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
indeed it could not be otherwise
only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
the since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power always far from being sins through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
even if there was one a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition amen to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such bows was an advantage because the violence of the government was less than the violence of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strike between the individual seem still less and a life of the state seems even more secure
it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle in conquest
after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
but this justification is never more than temporary
internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression deserted by the authority over the dissentient individuals
governed authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
and therefore the oppression of the oppress always goes on growing after the furthest woman beyond which it cannot go about killing the goose with the golden ice
the most convincing example this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest
so it h always been
footnote the fact that in america the abuses of authority exists in spite of a small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position de positively confirms it
the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer belong on incitants men they feel that this purity of their position depends on the increased drink of the army
the reason to which he gave expressions essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the popes engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of the day so carefully distribute the recruits so that the regiments from the frontier their stationed in central districts and the regiments from the center are stationed on the frontiers
the meaning of cubey speech put into plain language is that funds are needed not to resist foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the enslave toiling masses
and this abnormal order of thanks is maintained by the army
but there is not only one goverment there are other governments exporting their such as by violent in the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its enslave subjects
and so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its neighbour brigands
this increases contagious as montesquieu pointed out hundred fifty years ago
every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defence against its subjects becomes a sort of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
the despotism of the government always increases with the strength of the army and as external successes and the aggressiveness of the government increases with its internal despotism
the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse the universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers who obtained at the least possible express
and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practiced upon them all citizens have become their own impresses
this inconsistency has become obvious and universal third service
in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitory of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life the groups of persons
but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and insecurity existence are called upon to face all the perils they had meet to avoid
but instead of doing that they exposed the individual to the same necessity of strife substituting strike with individuals of other states for strife with neighbours
the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the graved part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
the danger of war ever ready to break out renders all reforms of lis social like vain and fruitless
but the fated significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense but that is not true
there are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an accomplice in all that acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
and for the sake of what are i making them
i am expected for the sake of a states to make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
except for the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number that that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence
so that the justification of stay violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil suppose persons even if it had some foundation three of four centuries ago has none whatever now
except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means a communication so on
without the state men would not have been able to form a social institutions needed for doing anything
this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in forming societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
without government's nations were be enslaved by their neighbors
the government they tell us with its army is necessary defend us from neighboring states who might enslave us
and if defence against barbarous nations is meant one thousandth parts of the troops now under arms would be amply sufficient for that purpose
the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes on the contrary the much greater danger of such a tacks
even looking at it practically weighing that is to say all the burdens laid on him by the states no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with a state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantages than to refuse to do so
to resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not capable
so much for the advantages and disadvantages of both lines of conduct for a man of a wealthy class and oppressor
for a man of the poorer working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages
say you know supper
chris looked from medical plated flash like to a card jack can spark plug
no one you's a job ban that's chickie harris
o kay he said
only why didn't you ask em yourself
mike became uneasy and fished in elastic band out of his pocket made a flick of paper and sent it soaring out in em street
well he admitted i did
crass and for the first time that day the heavy weight he carried within him lifted and lightened little
think he really needs it in pursue
he would have liked to get the jaw for jakie who needed it but somehow the task of facing mister wicker especially now that the light was going in dusk edged into the streets was not what christen intended for ending the afternoon
mike's expression changed on one once to one of triumph but br was only partially encouraged
bet yur goin after all this turned to on him
might was standing on the corner
ah shocks
chris start it off once more passing a bleak little victorian church perched on the hill of mister work's house
an empty lot cut him into by church lane gave a look of isolations of ale shape brick building it sir mister wicks both house in place of business
the longer wing towards the back g a back door that opened on a water street the space between the house and wisconsin avenue had been made into a neat up along flower garden fenced off with a sidewalk by box shrugs in the white picket fence
a livid yellow stained theorizing beyond the factories inlay clouds lowered and tumbled above
the air was growing chill and chris sided to finish the job
all at once he wondered how his mother was and everything at him i pinched and tightened itself
at the foot of the hill and he reached the house
there were three things that always caught his eye a meant the litter of dusty pieces
otto left the coil of rope in the centre the bottom of a sailing ship in the grain glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of a negro boy in baggy trousers turkish jacket and white turban
but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe at home in bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabelle
he had never seen anyone go into mister wicker's shop now he thought of it
how then did he lamps and what did he ever sell
a sudden car horn walking from his dream
the many times he had examined mister wicker's window and poured over the rope the ship and the nubian boy he had never gone into mister hooker's shop
some now alone till someone should answer the bell they looked eagerly if uneasily around him
but with one window in the lowering day outside the long narrow shot was sombre
had the hand un beams crossed it from one side to the other
mister looks back being towards the source of light chris could not see his face
the double fans of minute wrinkles breaking from eye quartered a temple and joining with those over the sheep bones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead
little tops of white funds above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarians hair but what drew and held chris's gaze with the old men's eyes
chris linked and looked again yes they were still there
chris swallowed it his vice came back and
yes sir he said
i set your sign and i know boy who neats the job
he's a schoolmate of mind
jennie paris's name is new reeling is the job
i i just wondered if the pic was to open
what he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humour in his face and something scented in in appealing about his eyes
he guessed there must be a lively fire from that room beyond
would that fear with jakie gigs gidding the job sir
but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his minds why do he not seem the reflection of the headlights at the cars moving bob around the crier of wall utter street not the hill towards the lef signals
the room seemed overly still
then in that second deterred and faced about
the wide bow wind it was there before him and three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that tore it in from a cross of water
chris the water where was the free way
it was no longer there n were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen
the warehouses were still there
flabbergasted and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer to peer out the window in every direction
no electric signs no lapt streets
when the people's stroke store and stood but half an hour before rose the roofs of what was evidently an inn
a courtyard was firstly met by flaring torture too showing the swinging sign hung on a post
the posts planted at the edge of it was now a broad and money row and
the coach with had stopped piled high with lugged stamped to a halt beside the flac court card
they moved it to the end the coach rattled off to the stable
my window has a power for those few who are to see
the learning of magic was by no means easy
he told his master at once he bought simon goesler his hoard of money his hiding places for it
chris therefore threw himself and of all the primaries in his task
one afternoon when he returned after a rest to mister winkle's study he saw that there was something new in the room a ball with a gold fish in it stood on the table but mister wicker was not to be seen
what should allan do first
how you improved my boy he exclaimed it is n time for you to try missis h got a change is any
suppose i changed and kat changed back
mister wicker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for chris to get up his courage
that is nothing happened with a voice like a whip mister wiggs said start at once
a sensation spread faster and faster
his head swam and he felt faint new little sick but he persisted through the final words
he thought nor without a feeling of pride and commences experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight at some little time elapsed before mister wicker's voice bloom bows by
seventy four book one the return
the figure's shoes carved in some eastern style and curved up pointing toes
that all at once the idea came to chris
if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
he squatted on his haunches and singed the carved wooden figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion
but how did one change inanimate to enim it
chris got up and stole back to mister work's door
he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his broom above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was reeling empty mister june's proper shape and opened the doors of the cupboard at the far end of the room
the afternoon raining before increased in storm
thus came to hours before its time thunder snarled in the sky
certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time
mister worker began moving about upstairs the full boards creaked gran ray and still chris could not leave until the potion fumed and glowed
with infinite caution chris closed the door silently behind him in running light be forward preeched the figure the negro boy
it was as if the stiffness melted
under his eyes wizened folds of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its rounding upon the coat and oh the face
the wind grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquets of car flowers moved a the bouquet fall
they went down to their corners first
guess mister finney went to his quarters i don't remember seeing him cross a backer come over that way at all
next net cilley was relaying to the helm by over joneses it took over ned went on down
it looks to me as if it could be been one of several people and i'll be switched if i know who well give my eyes open
the mirabelle was nearing ted
we've ha her and fresh stalls to take old mare
chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin
certainly my boy boomed out the captain as blue eyes abruptly keen and penetrating
mister finney will be some time on deck we cannot be own heard in here
his face rose with nervousness that this might do o do was in answer and he stood stiff and stone before captain blizzards
the captain sat forwards in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say that i do
the ship had more to me than wife or mother or family
pause fingering his lower lip but looking sideways in a reflective fashion at chris standing before him
or we shall say no more but i trust you understand the responsibility you
a ship its cargo in its men will be in your hands
yes sir i think i can do it safely or i should not try sir
captain blizzard's round pink faced creased in its winning smile
you then went on to descry what else was to father for covering in the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
the camouflage was not a word the captain or anyone else of his time he had understood
what can be said during that time sir chris thought to ask
i am somewhat skill in medicaments i have to be as a captain of ship and crew know it
i shall say that you are in my own cabins as i can care for you
not since he had left mister wicker and chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
he knew now that his absence for as long as he had had to be away would be covered up and satisfaction inly accounted for
their conversation had taken some little while
when churchyards jon
i knew well enough that he might be carried thousand miles and box scar locked in perhaps without water or full
i'm sure i kissed lady and i've had terrible moments since when i seem remember kissing mister jamieson too with excitement
fortunately war on the detach to were keeping basal or holland lodge
as of direst lady they washed her dishes whiles day and accorded queer messes according to their several abilities
miss eames he said stopping me as i was about to wald to my room upstairs how are your nerves tonight
i have none i said happily
i mean he persisted you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual
the most unusual thing i can think of would be a peaceful night
something is going to occur he said
put on heavy shoes and some old our clothes and nec up your mind not to be surprised at anything
livy was sleeping sleep of the just when i went upstairs and i hunted out my things scaly
they were chucking confidently together but when they came down they ceased
there were few preparations to be made locks to be gone over winters to instructive as to renewed vigilance and then after extinguishing the hall light we crept in darkness threw front door and into the night
i ask no questions
was only somebody spoke and then it was an emphatically the profanity from doctor stewart when he ran into a wire fence
i ry know what i expected
the doctor was puffing somewhat where we finally came to a halt
i profess that just at that minute even sunnyside seemed a cheerful spot
in spite of myself a drum breath in sharply
it was alex under two long handled spades
the doctor kept a kin look out but e one appeared
there's one thing sure i'll not be suspected of complicity

he fell of me to the library
i thought hal and put into his hands stew of mills and sliders wounded it from london and written during one of his wall seasons of recipes the other in the country during a lucid interval
the former was full of trouble and anguish not accusing him but keep the regretting his connection with his profligate companions abusing mister grimsby and others insinuating bitter things against mister humping don and most ingenuously throwing the blame of her husband's misconduct on the other man's shoulders
i've been a cursed rascal god knows said he as he gave it a earth discreet but you see if i don't make a mans for it and me if i don't

stanley stanley it would be mercy to kill me she broke her again
bright and natty with the chintz curtains and the little toilet set out not inelegant and her pet bi pin goldfinch asleep on his perch with a bit of sugar between the wires of es cage her pillow so white and unpressed with its little edging of lace
when he came back to the drawing room a totty bottle of o the gloom in his hand with her lace handkerchief he bathed her temples and forehead
there was nothing very brotherly in his look as he peered into a pale sharp features during the process
there don't mind me she said sharply and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle he had just sat down and went swiftly to her room
and she threw back her whew and going hurriedly to the toilet mechanically survey herself from the glass
racy latently what are you know
i'll stay here that is in the joining room she answered and the face was withdrawn
he slackened the space and tapped sharply at the little window of the mightest post office at which the young ladies in the pony carriage had pulled up the day before and within which look rag it was wont to sleep in a sort of wooden box that folded up and appeared to be a chest of drawers all day
look took care of mister larkin's dogs and groomed mister wilder's horse and cleaned up his door cart for marking close about money and finding that the thing was to be done more cheaply that way put up his horse and door cart in the post of his premises and so evaded the livery charges of the brandon arms
the luke was now there and captain lake recollecting his habits and his haunt hurried on to the silver lion which has its cable towards the common only about a hundred steps away for distances are not great in joy ling don

luke stuck home his greasy wide a week and in a few minutes more the dark cart was trundled out into the limb and the horse harness went between the sharps with that wonderful cheerfulness with which they bared to be palled up under startling circumstances an unseasonable hours
if i thought your fiendly now to mar i should never come back good night tamar
the acts said that in ease of difference of opinion there must be about
he went up to the table and striking it with his fingering he shouted loudly ballad
he was shouting for the very course searching ivanovitch had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and rowed in o opposition to it the same vindictiveness though in a more seemly fall on the other side
shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for odo a ballad
we shed o blood for our country
the confidence of the monarch with no shaking the accounts of the martian he's not of cashier but that's nother point
votes please peace
they expressed the most implacable hatred
levin did not in the least understand what was it matter and he marvelled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision above fler off should be put to the vote
he forgot as soir gi ivanovitch explained to him afterwards this silicious that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province but to get into the martian it was necessary to have a majority of wards that to get a majority of boards it was necessary to secure ferox right about that to secured the recognition of flerov p's writ about there was decided on the interpretation to be put on the act
but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement
to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the freshman bar
he particularly like the way one gray whiskered waiter who showed us gone for the other younger was and was dured at by them was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly
levin advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to searching ivanovitch with the question were moray to put it
so's i ivanovitch frown
that is a matter for each man's own decision he said severely
having put it in he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left hand to and so he thrust at it though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background
a hundred and twenty six for admission ninety eight against
sang o vice of the secretary who could not plan a letter or
then there was a laugh a button and two knots were found in the box
but the old party did not consider themselves conquered
in oblige ment off spoke of the trust and noblemen of the province had placed to him the a fatal they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service
this expression in the marshal's face was particularly touching to levin because only the day for he had been at his house about his trusty business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kind hearted fatherly man
if there are men younger and more deserving than i let themself
and the marshal disappeared through a side door
there were to proceed immediately to the election
two noble gentlemen who had a weakness was strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of snetkov and a third had been robbed of his uniform
un learning this the new party had made haste during the disreputable flit off to send some of their men in his sledge to clothe the stripped gentlemen and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting
lenin did not care to eat and he was not smoking he did not want to join his own friends that a starchy ivanovitch stepan arkadyevitch sviazhsky and the rest because vronsky in an query uniform was turning with them in eager conversation
he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him
hes such a blank god
i have told him so that it makes no difference only think of it
these portions were unmistakably seeing a place where they could talk with about being overheard
shall they go on your excellency find champagne
lust your anna district martial nicolai images
oh still just the same always at a loss the landowner answered with a resigns mind but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be
why what is that to understand
there's no meaning in it at all
then two one must keep of connections
it's a model obligation of a sort
and then to delude there's one's own infers
their proprietors of a sot but we are the landowners
that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
and we are laying now a garden climbing one before the house you know and there you have a tree that stood the centuries in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you don't cut down the old fellow to make home for the flower beds but lay out your beds so as to take advantage the shay
well and how is your land doing
but one's work are thorn in for nothing
oh well one dover what would you have
and once more the landowner went on leaning his elbows on the window and chapping on my son i must only has no days for it
so there will be no one to keep it out and yet one dolt
we've walked about the fields and the garden no said he step on miss livid everything's well looked after but your gardens neglected
to mind thinking i'd got down the lantry
here your thousands of lines and each would make two good bottles a bark
youre married i heard said the landor
yes it's jis strange he went on
the landowner chock under his white moustaches
why don't we cut down our box for tuum
said levin but don into a thought that i'd struck him
there's a class instinct too of what one ought and ought no to do
there's the peasants too i wonder of them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
without a return too and of simple loss
when he came from the bath process visited him again
but hermon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honor of the seventieth birthday of the old sculptor euphrates
she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour
so the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition
the banquet was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing dy and telling her the words of the oracle
he longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescue demeter might yet be the work of mer talus had again mastered him
the approval as well as a doubts which had arise in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts
then he went directly to the neighbouring palace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered an impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy
when hermon entered the residence of the grammaticus in the palace the guests had already assembled
the place by hermit's side which althesa had chosen for herself would then be given up to arsenal
true an interesting conversation still had power to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight and referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyment as blindness de bared him
a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and women to whom no tad bound him save the presence of the same host
creates had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair haired nike had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing arsenals praises among his professional associates
his son had been the royal dame's first husband and she had deserted him to marry l menus the aged king of thrace
the king's sister the object of his love cried hermon incredulously
we women are only as old as we look and the leeches entiring woman of this beauty of forty practise odds which give her the appearance of twenty five yet perhaps the king values her intellect more than hippy wisdom of a hundred serpents is certainly united in this woman's head
the three most trustworthy ones i hear ames the liege chrysippus in the admirable procne
let us hope that you will make this three leaved clover the luck promising four leaved one
your uncle too has often with praise worthy generosity helped arno in many an embarrassment
how long he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the whole city with delight
when he did finally seven he fed things which must have wounded you
that is going too far replied herman
he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arsenal had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in roads
the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and althesa eagerly confirmed the statement
her ma was into apparent silence
the rudin was just beginning to praise arsenal also as a special friend and connoisseur of the sculptor's art when crates heron's fellow student asked the blind artist in behind of this beautiful companion why his demeter was placed upon a pedestal which to others as well as himself seemed too high for the size of the statue
yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of sky at him
a woman who earns for the regard of all men and makes love a toy easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals
only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and althesa did not wish to lose hermit's regard
how indifferent you look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you were still a genuine creating artist the case was different
those so louder denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no idol and snaps me i can prove
it was nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
not a sound if you value your lives
to offer resistance would have been madness for even harmon perceived by the loud clanking of weapons round them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prison near the place of execution
was he to be led to the executioner's block
what pleasure had like to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art
ought he not to greet his sudden end as a boom from the immortals
did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be imagined
whatever might await him he desired go better fate
if he had passed into annihilation he hermon wished to follow him thither and annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
but if he were destined to meet his virtus and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not tell them how sure he was a finding a joyful reception there from both
the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was non nemesis no it was a kindly deity
yet it was no illusion that deceived him
again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
sometimes with the touching entreaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philippe her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
cried hermon in grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and follow the soldier whom the captain detailed to guide her into the palace
to morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path
daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philip was silence char with a grave exclamation the order of the king
as soon as the captive artist was alone with a woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forward incoherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly returned the pressure he could not restrain the desire to class perch with heart
in spite of his deep mental distress he could have shouted aloud in his delight and gratitude
he might now have been permitted to find forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the palest to the following morning still sealed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought not to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impulse he exclaimed you know that i love you
i love you and have loved you always
daphney exclaimed tenderly what more it's needed
but hermon with drooping head murmured to more i shall no longer be what i am now
then affy raised her face to his asking so the demean is the work of merton's
put a terrible ordeal again awaits you
and i fool planed also in mind could be vexed with you for it
bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it if you consent with the time arrives to become on conceal i palliate nothing
so our ki intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day
he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
his heart contracted painfully it is solicitude about his uncle's fate increased when philippa informed him that the conspirators had been wrested at the banquet ant headed by ames the rodion chrysippus and brocas had perished by the executioner's sword at sunrise
besides he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one last word
on the way his heart throbbed almost to bursting
even anne's image and what threatened her father and her with him was seated far into the background
he was appearing before his companions only to give truth it's just due
the egyptian obey and his master crossed the wide space strewn with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the festal performances even had his eyes retained the power of sight his blood was coursing so widely through his veins that he might perhaps have been enabled to distinguish the statues around him and the thousands of spectators who crowded closely together richly garlanded their cheeks glowing with enthusiasm surrounded the arena hermon
shouted his friend solus and joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk harmon
even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeanour he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become fatal through his art and his nature
honour to merciless and his art but he trusted the s noble festal assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception and a his prayer for recovery
afterward it was supposed that he was satisfied with a blood of oxen lamps and dos and that in exchange for or in account of these sacrifices this god gave rain fans shine and harvest
whether he was the creator of yourself and myself
whether any prayer was ever answered
why he decreed the intellectually inferior
why did they create the deformed and erebus why d they create the criminal the idiotic the insane
are the failures under obligation to their creator
is irresponsible for all the walls that have been waged for all the innocent blood that have been shed
is responsible for the centuries of slavery for the backs that had been scarred with a lash for the bab that had been so from the breasts of mothers for the families that had been separated and destroying
is this got responsible for religious destitution for the inquisition for the tone screw and rack and for all the instruments of torture
it d got alone the cruel and vile to destroy the brave and virtue
did hod tyrants to shed a blood of patriots
can we conceive of a devil base enough to prefer his vanities to his friends
how can we account for the wild beasts that the war human beings for the franked serpents whose bit is death
how can the account for a world were live feats on life
did infinite with them intentionally produce the microscopic beasts that feed upon the optic nurse think of blinding a man to satisfy the appetite of a microbe
fear beats the altar enough is the sacrifice
fear arts the cathedral and bows the head of man in worship
lips relics and fearful tremblingly would be this passage though he slay me yet will i trust him
can we say that he cared for the tun of men
can we say that his mercy endured forever
to reprove his goodness by showing that he has opened the erst and swallowed the thousand of his helpless children or that with the volcanoes he has overwhelmed them with rivers of fire
was their goodness was their wisdom in this
all the superior rays too thank gott that they entered the inferior
most people clink to the supernatural
if they give up one god they imagine another
what is this hour
man advances and necessarily advances through experience
a man wishing to go to a certain place come to where the road divides
he has tried that road and knows that it is the wrong road
a child charmed by the beauty of the flame grasped into his dimpled hand
the power that work for righteousness had taught the child a listen
it is a reason
it is insisted by the theologians and by many of the so called philosophers that this moral sense this sense of duty of obligation was imported and that conscience is an exotic
leave to getting families drives and nations
they out praised admired and respected
they are regarded as good that is to say as moral
the members who added to the misery of the family the tribe of a nation are considered bad meanders
the greatest of human beings had said conscience is bor of love
as people advance you remote consequences are perceived
the imagination is cultivated
a man but seems so in the place of another
the sense of duty becomes stronger more imperative
man judge himself
in all this there is nothing supernatural
man has deceived himself
has christianity dan good
where the church had control were men made better and happier
what test region done for angry or osier
could these countries have been worse without religion
could they have been worse that they had any other religion than christianity
what did christianity would ful them
the hated pleasure
they muffled all the bells of drabs
dur leisure of the puritan was an an adulterated curse
the puritan believed the bible to be the word of god and this belief has always made those who held it cruel and wretch it
let me refer to just one fact showing the influence of a belief in the bible on human beings
the queen received the bible kissed it and pledged herself too diligently withe therein
in other words it was just as fiendish just as infamous as the catholic spirit
has the d i will made the people of george or kind and merciful
her legion has been pried and in all couples in all times that's fain
religion has always been the enemy of science of investigation and thought
re legion is never made men free
it is never made man moral tempered industrious and honest
our christians more temperate nearer virtues nearer honest than savages
commit your disease by supplication
can we receive virtue or hunger as arms
religion rests on the idea that nature has a master and that his master re listen to prayer that his master punishes and rewards that he loves praise and flattery and hates the brave and free
we must have gone the stones
destructive had abasement
if we built we must begin at the bottom
i have a theory and i have four calm stones
the first stone is that matter substance cannot be this forward cannot be annihilated
is this cond stones our facts it follows as a necessity that matter and force are from end to eternity that they can neither be increased nor diminished
it follows that nothing has been or can be created that there never has been or can be a creator
it followed that there could not have been any intelligence and in design back of matter and force
i say what i think
every even hasp
that which hath not happened good not
in the infinite chained ris and a camp no brogan no missing link
we now knew that our first parents were not foreign us
we now know if we know anything that the universe is natural and that man and women have been naturally produced
we know the parts that life has travelled
we know the footsteps of advance they have been crazed
for thousands of years men and women have been trying to reform the world
why have the reforms same
they depend on the law on luck ajar dy
they live by frau and viols and bequeath their vices to their chilion
failure seems to be the traded mark of nature why
nature produced without purpose the states without intention and destroys without faults
master world forever remained a victim of ignorant passion
why should men and women have children that they cannot take care of childrens that are burden and curses why
passion is and always has been death
nor can punish but it can neither reform criminals nor prevent crime
this cara be done by talk or example
this is the solution of the whole question
this freeze women
bove the and grime we be chinless
it is far better to be free to leave the faults and barricades of fear to stand erect and faith the future with a smile
there done far said the schoolmaster in the loki to the sweat outward up the trio and mind your eye
the two monsters took off fir shoes and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses
by means of this stratagem they followed so closely that over within the few steps of sara and tom they did not hear them
sarah and her brother having again passed by the tippy fag arrived close to the dilapidated house which was partly in bins and its open cellars formed a kind of gulf along which the street ran in that direction
in an instant the schoolmaster with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized seated with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling you into his hole
no said the old broad grumblingly no not one thing my a shame
tom seated did not lose his presence of mind during this scene rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred
o ahhh to lay a trap to catch us replied the thief
then addressing thomas satan you know the plane of saint dennis
did you see in the cavalry we have just left for i know you again the man whom the charcoal man came to seek
cried the schoolmaster a thousand francs and i'll kill in
that i do not seek his life replaced sarah to the schoolmaster
let's go and meet him
all boy it would p for looking after
well my wife shall be there said the schoolmaster you will tell how what you want and i shall see
in the plain of sainte denis
between sainte la and the road of luar revolt at the end of the rope agreed
he had forgotten the address of the self styled ha painter
the fac is started
france who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert's request but at once accompanied him to the desired spots and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon
my very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions
my father the comte de morcerfs although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i am hesitating replace the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal
i can scarcely credit it
then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity li the present to realise plans that i have long meditated
show me the positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude and keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to adopt
so be it then replied the count's and extending his hand toward the calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said to days the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o'clock now promise me to remember this and expect me the twenty first of me at the same hour in the forenoon
i residing my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the farther site of the courtyard and titles separated from the main building
now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your timepiece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself
that depends when do you leave
for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two
then we shall not meet in paris
i fear i shall not have her honour
well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young man allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey
what is the matter asked albert of france when they had returned to their own apartments you see more than commonly thoughtful
i will confess to you all but replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
did you ever mead him previously to coming hither
upon my honour and lying any
he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the bottle of the thousand and one nights he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof our trace of all these events save the small york seen in the distant arising driving under full sail tow port or
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino an engagement wedge as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled
but said france the cot kin bandits that were among the crew of his vessel
why really the thing seems to meet simple enough
talking of countries replied france of what countries the counts what is his native thumb whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life a life as marvellous as alone that hath tinctured his succeeding years were so dark and blooming and misanthropy
certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered
my dear france replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert the morcerf is in danger helped me to deliver him
what are his means of existence what is his both place of what country's native
i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from the hands of senor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and and concern i did not very particularly care to remain
and this time it must be confessed that contra of the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's side
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation
and now my dear france let us talk of something else
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination al bear the morcerf would follow up his researches by means of a small gait similar to that close to the concierge store and which merits a particular description
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and caught these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate
at a quarter to ten a valid entered he composed with a little room named john and who only spoken lish all albert's establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count's chasseurs also
wait then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes
very well at half past ten
is the countess hope yet
the valet left the room
good morning is younger morning said albert your punctuality really alarms me
you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past
no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans
yes he has not much to complain of bors is the capital of charles the seven
it is for that reason you seem you so early
i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i gossiped to have a ride for an hour
pests i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them acceptable
besides that does not concern the horn but the financial department
about what about the papers
in the entire political wold of which you are one of the leaders
they say that it is quite fair and that sewing so much red you ought to reap a little blue
come come that is not bad said lucia
with the old talents he would make your fortune in three or four years
the gentleman had not im needed to sit down to become interested apparently he had taken up the volume from a table as soon as he came in and standing there after a single glance round the apartment had lost himself in its pages
that has an unflattering sound for me said the young man
she is wing to his b
just as i am the visitor inquired presenting himself with brother a workaday aspect
he was tall went lean and dressed throughout in black his shirt collar was low and wide and a triangle of linen a little trampled exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat was adorned by your pin containing a small red stone
in spite of this decoration the young man looked poor as far as a young man could look who had such a fine head and such magnificent eyes
there is a basal ransom went dark deep and glowing his hand had a character of elevation which fairly added to his stature it was ahead to this scene above the level with the crowd and some judicial bench or political platform or even on a bronze medal
these things the eyes especially with their smoldering fire might have indicated that he was to be a great american statesmen or on the other hand that might simply have proved that he came from carolina or alabama
and yet the reader who lets a complete image who desires to read with the senses as well as with the reason is entreated not to forget that had prolonged his countenance and swallowed his vowels that he was gil to allegiance and interpolations which were equally unexpected and that his discourse was pervaded by something sultry and vast something always that riven in its rich basking tone something that suggested the tuning expanse over cotton field
and he took up his hat vaguely a soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim
well so it is they are all witches and wizards mediums and spirit lappet and rowing radicals
if you are ning to dine with her you had better know it oh murder
in lifted missus luni with intelligent incredulity
she was attractive and impertinent especially the latter
hat he been in youre
no i haven't been anywhere
she hates it she would like to abolish it
this last remark he made that a venture for he had naturally not devoted any supposition whatever to missus lena
are you very ambitious you look as if you were
and missus mina added that now she was back she didn't know which she should do
one did have given n would one have come back for
besides olive didn't want her in boston and didn't gaze though the form of sailing so
that was one comfort with emly she never went from any forms
she stood there looking consciously and whether seriously and mister ransom a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lips it was just perceptible enough to light up the native gravity of her face
her voice was no and agreeable a cultivated voice and she extended a slender white hand to her visitor who remarked with some solemnity he felt a certain guilt of participation in missus luna's indiscretion that he was intensely happy to make her acquaintance
he hsi that miss chancellor's hand was at once called and limp she nearly placed it in his without exerting the smallest pressure
i shall be back very late we're then due a fut of party that's when we die said early
missus lean's familiarity extended even to her sister she remarked to miss chancellor that she looked as if she were got up for a sea voyage
poor ransom announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery p in reality he had never been so bit as at that moment
the women he had hitherto known had been mainly his own soft climb and it was not often exhibited the tendency he detected and cursorily deplored in missus lon sister
ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very provincial
he was sorry for her but his sorr in a flash that no one could help her that was what made her preached
she could not defend herself against a rich admiration a kind of tenderness of envy of anyone who had been so happy as to have that opportunity
his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruelty of debates
the state of mississippi seemed to him the state of despair so he surrendered the remnants of his pash mony to his mother and sisters and at nearly thirty years of age delighted for the first time in new york in the costume of his province with fifty dollars in his pocket and a now in hunger in his heart
it was in the female line as bales of manson had written in answering her letter with a good deal form and flemish his spirit as they had been royal houses
if it had been possible to send missus ransom money or even clothes she would have liked that but she had means of ascertaining her such a muffling would be taken
on if had a fear of everything but had grown to spear was of being afraid
she had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that whenever she saw risk she was to take it and she had frequent humiliations at finding herself saved after
she was perfectly safe after writing to beels him and indeed it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thanked her he was only exceptionally superior for her letter and assure her that he would come and see her the first time this business he was beginning to get at at all should take him to boston
he was too simple too mississippian for that she was almost disappointed
of all things in the world contention was most sweet to her that why it is hard to imagine who had always cast her tears headaches a deal too in bad acute and it was no impossible baser ransom would not care to compend
mischance of herself apt so much a device or subject would not she make a few remarks and give them some of her experiences
how did the mate is a beacon's street feel about the ballot
there she could speak for them more their fools th others
with immense sympathy for reform she found herself so often wishing that befool as wherein it different
i have hated ere that finer than you talked out as if it were such a remarkable place and to live their w proof of lovely glory
no shorts of can fear you people if there and so brilliant a woman is missus stander had lifted blackberry not not to mix thicks up
she knew the place in the boston highway key and was not what missus balling supposed so that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been o representative for the aristocracy
soon wished to act in another field she had known been preoccupied with the romance o the people
this might singing of the most accessible of pleasures but in pint of fact she had not found it so
charlie was al man in a wide overcoat and a paper collar it was mire in the later nicest that the cared muche the most
oh chancellor wondered how missus diner would treat their gran to the question
it would be necessary well repent to take seven steps to conciliate the shrinking
our movement is all it will be also the most stacked ladies
there's the standard am them and bringing your thousand bees
and look after the details as well as the book currents missus waller added in a tone as explanatory as could be expected of such a woman and with a smile of which the sweetness wist filling to her listener
so olive chancellor with a vase which seemed to plead for a remission responsibility
i want to the need to them to help them
it was nothing to choose for herself but now the local present give of the encased to those sex from every former bandage her chosen for her
the unhappiness of women
they were his sisters they were her own and the gilder livery had dawned
this was the only sacred cause this with the great the duster volition it was giant it was swing downing before it it must exact from the honour the duco blast and madam race the lost party grew of expiation
there would be names of willing week insulted to persecuted but devoted in have impulse of the being to the cause and asking no better faith than to die for it
it were not clear to this interesting girl in what manner such a sacrifice at this last would be acquired of her though she saw the matter through a kind of sour wise mister the nation which lame danger as rosie is success
when this boughs i approached it transfigured her familiar ho comical sheep and made the poor little humanity hack singer ready a martyr
o if chancellor looked at her would love remembered that she had never in her longing in the world and wary life had a thought on
she had been consumed by the passion of sympathy it had crumbled her into as many creases and all glazed distended glove
but excuse me den you forgot during some detecting an given up fishing
and shag were the freedom of an old servant stood looking at his mastery as if not great understanding the new twist the authors had taken
i'm going our fishin i may not catch anything and mean i want to after i get there
good reddy shag yes a cun
and having put himself in a fair way as he hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darcy case colonel ashley went down to police headquarters to learn more facts in the connection with the murder of the east indian
picks and done of and haven't they carol yee up
carl was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke girl lazily upward on his cigar just then to say more
are you going to work on that case colonel
but he hadn't any more to do with it colonel in that cat
perhaps not admitted colonel ashley
we've got our man and that's all we want
you're on the darcy case they tell me in a way yes
i'm marking in the interest of the young man
it's just one of them coined int is like
busted his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair
gad explained the colonel
the very pair i was going to buy
look here colonel do you know anything about this
and the detective's professional w instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
i happened to see those candlesticks in the window of single pons shop the other day and i made up my mind to buy them when i had a chance
now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen
thought i don't know whether that's his first or his last name anyhow he had a par or named cheerily
anyhow he infected get long bury well it seems
neighbor's often heard him scraping along and this afternoon they went at it again to hawking heavy
toward dark a man went into by a lamp
you found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was all e's body with the head busted in in this heavy candlestick near it
sure held so tight we could hard to get it out
maybe the fight was about who own the watch for the dagoes talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were saying i see
and the watch have you it gle ter
that's the watch announced the headquarters detective reaching in for it going at see
you're not a scream dish as all that are you just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's
and don of hiss voice was plainly sceptical
yes it be have some rough edges on it
and i've read enough about germs to know the danger i'd advise you to be careful
if you don't mind i should like to examine this bit
before the big wind and ireland suggested thong with a nodded desirous compatriot slightly you'll have the colonel
that's right agreed the colonel as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
in a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a lead pencil
and donovan take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it
has the surprised detective yes
don't scratch yourself on it whatever you do why not
simply because this watch
some one out her to see you
all right beet here in a second
send a put was the panting answer
i want to talk over darcy's case with you the colonel had said and the two had talked had thought had talked again and now were silent for a time
what are the church of getting him off legally if we go lighted from a negative standpoint asked the colonel
rather a hypothetical question colonel but i should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition
at best he would get off with a scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn't want that nor do i
and you hid to wanted either
but i want to know just where we stand now i know
but i need to do a little more smoking out first now i want to think
if you'll excuse me i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may catch something
in fact i have a feeling that ill lend my fish
i'd recommend him to you instead of blackstone thanks lapped kenneth
what is it perhaps i can help you
the old adage of two head you know
yes it still homes good
no alimony replied the colonel puzzled yes just that
and there's no reason you shouldn't know
chuckled the colonel as he skilfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook
and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip a now limp fish into the creole colonel ashey gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
the reason she asked no alimony inquired kenneth
no i wasn't thinking of that
however don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough for to day
well i don't know that you can
it isn't generally known went on the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him
it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of a baser sort
you don't mean the large struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did
the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him
aaron graft and statement was being unexpected great confirmed
he remembered that cynthia and grafton had once been in love with each other
she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer
because larch made no defence
large by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
so i had to let her have her way and mid i asked the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel fee
no but he will or i'll sue him and get judgment oh he'll pay all right
and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up
still i would like to know
the murder of missus darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweller was tried
it had a double reputation so to speak
grave and even reverend the conventions assembled in its ball room and politicians of the upper if not better class were frequently seen in its dining room or cafe
large himself was a peculiar character
in a smaller place he would have been called a salon keeper
and it was this man rich over said handsome certainly that cynthia retford had married
to this was the answer whispered money
and in a way was true
she also sighed opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges
after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the larch hotel it could hardly be called a home became the scene of many festive occasions
then it was said of large that soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat his wife with refined cruelty that hidden away from the public underneath his habitual manner there was the wrongness of the brute
but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less often represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smirched or who had not yet acquired any and were rolling to take a chance
it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me in the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be seen there kenneth explained to the colonel
meanwhile colonel ashley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he saw darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something to be done always returned the answer
don't worry he will come out all right
i'm going to rectify them but it will take time
it's hard for miss mason too although she's bearing up like a major
so king got bail who put it up
it was hi larch
they took harry away while ago
but he is a pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same
only that eye darcy hesitated and grew red
good evening colonel he called genially will you join me in a welsh rabbit
thank you no
i'm afraid my dad jess and isn't quite up to that as i've had to cut out my fishing of late
now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder
the stopped clocks for instance have you any theory
there were three of them the centre figure being gone of harry king and he was very much intoxicated
that is not always but sometimes it happened to be so now
i beg your pardon he said in the conjured tones he knew so well how to use yet of which he made so little use of late
i said where have you been remarked the other we've missed you
i said i was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort
bi polonius someone ask
because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
there was a rattle of coin on the mahogany bars king sought to disentangle a single bill from the wadded up currency in his pocket
it's it's an odd coin an old roman one that missus darcy had in in her private collection kept in the jewelry door safe was the whispered answer
i went over them near the day and notice some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was kilt
that was hers when on the door
now harry king has it exclaimed colonel
when even the sun came out pale and watery at noon
the colds and rheumatism of the rainy months vanished
asked to worker not sending you did it when the yunkers
while didn't they shoot us one man exhibited his arminius thing
haven't i gard something to remember them by the devils
who are you to destroy the legal government who is lenin a german
who are you a counter revolutionist a provocative they beloved at him
you call yourselves the people of r shepherd are not the people of russia
the peace ands other people of russia wait until the pass
we know what a peason you'll say aren't a working man like o ourselves
this man especially welcomed the call to congress of peasants
this last read the young generation who had been serving in the army
whereupon the whole executor committee left the hall
down with him they streaked
fearful tumbled christ down w the bolsheviki
upon my written i've visited morny no such accusation was made against me there after a brief conversation i left and that solve let any in present make such an accusation
meanwhile the question of the stratas of the excuse committee was agitating all minds
by declaring their assembly extraordinary conference it had been planned to pluck the reelection of the executive committee
but this word both ways the last socialist revolutionist decided that if the congress had no power over the exiled committee then the executive committee had no power over the congress
on the twenty seventh occurred the debate on the land question we should rev their differences between the agent programme of the bolsheviki and the least socialist revolutionist
the constituent assembly will not dare to break with the will of the people
followed him lenin listened to now with absorbing intensity
the first state was the crushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of the industrial capitalist and the landowners who interested our closely related
the dumas and seam stills were dropped
he knew that an agreement with the bolsheviki was being discoursed but he did not know that it to had been concluded
he spoke to the wrong convention
the villages will see us in the hand
but the present woman is international and that is why it is invincible
the wean of millions of workers is some concentrated in the hall
a new humanity will be born of this war
i greet you with the christians of an i ration life and freedom
then i took up a great stone from among the trees and coming up to him smote him therewithal the head with all my might and crushed in his skull as he lay dead drunk
behold a ship was making for the island through the dashing sea and flashing waves
hearing this i was sore troubled remembering what i had before suffered from the ape kind
upon this he brought me a cotton bag and gi it to me said take this bag and fill it with pebbles from the beach and gave forth with a company of the townsfolk to whom i will give a charge respecting thee
do as they do and belike thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land
then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pebbles
to these he committed me commending me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how together that he may get his daily bread and you will earn your reward and recompense in heaven
now sleeping under these trees were many apes which when they saw us rose and fled from us and swarmed up among the branches whereupon my companions began to pelt them with what they had in their bags and the apes fell to plucking of the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk
we weighed anchor and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying o permitted say
when it was the five hundred and fifty ninth night
and ceased not sailing till we arrived safely at bassorah
there i abode a little and then went on to bagdad i entered my quarter and found my house and were gathered with my family and saluted my friends it gave me joy of my safe return and i laid up all my goods and valuables in my storehouses
after which i returned to my old merry way of life and forgot all i had suffered in the great prophet and gain i had made
next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawned prayer and after blessing mohammed the cream of all creatures betook himself to the house of sinbad the seaman and wished him a good day
here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales therein
happily amongst you is one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up and all and everything on board of her were plunged into the sea
but it burneth in their bellies so they cast it up again and it congealed on the surface of the water whereby its colour and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it ashore and the travellers in merchants who know it collected and sell it
each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides and after little the rest of my fellows perished one by one till i had buried the last of the party and abode alone on the island with but a little provision left i who was wont to have so much
but there is majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great
when it was the five hundred and sixty first night
then signed for myself i set to work collecting a number of pieces of chinese and corner and aloes wood and i bound them together with robes from the wreckage then i chose out from the broken up ships straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the yellows wood making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel of the stream and i tied it tightly and firmly as though it were nailed
land after land shalt thou seek can find but no other life on thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul and thy thoughts a night all woes shall lend or sooner or late
i rode my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried with a raft with it down the underground channel
and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft by reason of the narrowness of the channel whilst the stream ceased not to carry me along knowing not night from day for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me about in my terror and concern for myself lest i should perish
when i awoke at last i found myself in the light of heaven and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft moored to an island in the midst of a number of indians and abyssinian
but i was delighted at my escape from the river
when they saw i understood the knight and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace be with thee o my brother
o my brother answered he we a husbandman untill of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding thee asleep on this raft laid hold of it and made it fast by us against thou shouldest awake at thy leisure
i answered for allah's sake and my lord ere i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after ask me what thou wilt
when it was the five hundred and sixty second night
she said it hath reached me our auspicious king that sindbad the seaman continued when our landed and found myself amongst the indians and abyssinian and had taken some rest they consulted among themselves and said to one another there is no help for it but we carry him with us and present him to our king that he may acquaint him with his adventures
so i consorted with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respect
so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing to set out with the merchants for that i pined after my people and mine own land
quoth he thou art thine own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us on a head nye be it for thou gladdest us with thy company
by allah are my lord answered i thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with thy favours and well doings but i weary for a site of my friends and family and native country
then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchant safer said
he asked me whence they came and i said to him by allah a commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way thither
for state processions a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant eleven cubits high and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks on his right hand and on his left
his letter hath shown me this and as for the mightiness of his dominion thou hast told us what thou hast thy witnessed
presently my friends came to me in i distributed presence among my family and gave arms and largesse after which i yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment mirth and merrymaking and forgot all that i had suffered
such then are my brothers is the history of what befell me in my sixth voyage and to morrow in shall
i will tell you the story of my seventh and last voyage which is still more wondrous and marvellous than that of the first six
when it was the five hundred and sixty third night
she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sinbad the seaman had related the history of what befell him in his sixth voyage and all the company had dispersed sinbad the landsman went home and slept as of want
the seventh voyage of sinbad the satan
no o company that after my return from my sixth voyage which brought me abundant profit i resumed my former life and all possible joyance and enjoyment and mirth and making merry day and night and i tarried some time in this solace and satisfaction till my soul began once more to long to sail the seas and see foreign countries and company with merchants and here new things
so having made up my mind i packed up in bales a quantity of precious stuffs suited for sea trade and repaired with them from baghdad city to bassorah town where i found a ship ready for sea and in her a company of considerable merchants
but the captain arose and tightening his girdle tucked up his skirts and after taking refuge with alla from satan the stoned climbed to the masthead whence he looked out right and left and gazing at the passengers and crew fell to buffet in his face and plucking out his beard
this he set in a saucer wetted with a little water and after waiting a short time smelt and tasted it and then he took out of the chest a booklet wherein he read awhile and said weeping no are yee passengers but in this book is a marvellous matter denoting that whoso come tit that shall surely die without hope of escape for that d ocean is called the sea of the climb of the king wherein is a sepulchre of our lord solomon son of david on both be peace
a second fish wait its appearance and which we had seen nought more monstrous
when suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship which rose out of the water and settled upon the great reef the haunt of sea monsters where it broke up and fell asunder into planks and all and everything on board were plunged into the sea
unfortunately there could be no doubt our misconception as the platter bat's gilt
he had not only pleaded guilty but had expressed his intention of repeating his escapade in other directions as soon as circumstances permitted throughout the trial he was visited piminy a small model of the free trade hall in manchester
vir jury could not possibly find that the prisoner had not deliberately an intention he blown up the albert hall the question was could they find any extenuating circumstances which would permit of an acquittal
of course any sentence which the law might feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an image at pardon but it was highly desirable from the governments pint a view that the necessity for such an exercise of clemency should not arise
a headlong pardon and the eve of a by election with threats of a heavy voting defection if it were withheld or even delaid would not necessarily be a surrender but it would look like one
hence the anxiety in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in whitehall and dawning street and other affected centres
the cheery return from considering their verdict there was a flutter an excited murmur a deck like hush
the foreman delivered his message
the cheery fine the prisoner guilty of blowing up the albert hall
the jury which to add a rider drawing attention to the fact that a by election spending in the parliamentary division of nemesis on hand
and made the lard have mercy on the pole a junior counsel exclaimed irreverently
fifteen hundreds said a prime minister with a shudder it's too horrible the thank
our majority last time was only a thousand and seven
seven thirty amended a prime minister we must avoid any appearance of precipitancy
not later then seven thirty ten said the chief organizer i have promised the agent down there that he shall be able to display posters announcing platter bath is out before the paul opens
he said it was our only chance of getting a telegram red rappers in to night
despite the earliness the hour a small crowd had gathered in the street outside and the horrible menacing tree lon earth rain of the fifteen hundred vaulting men came in a steady monotonous chant
he exclaimed won't go
he says he never has left prison without a breast band to play him out and he's not going to go without one now
said a prime minister we can hardly be supposed to supply earliest prisoner with a brass band how on the earth could be defended and estimates
anyway you won't go unless he has a band
all open sin five minutes
his flatter bath out yet
in heaven's name why
the chief our junior rang off
this is not a moment for standing on dignity he observed bluntly ne stations must be supplied at once
can't you get a strike permit as the organizer
i'll try said the home secretary and went to the telephone
eight o'clock struck the crowd outside chanted with an increasing volume of sound revolt the other way
i tell grammars brought in
it was from the central comet rooms at nemesis
without a band he would not go and they had no band
a quarter past ten half past
have you any band instruments of an easy nature to play
demanded the chief organizer of the prison governor drams symbols tho sort of things
the warders have a private band of their own said the governor but of course i couldn't allow them and themselves
blends the instruments said a chief organiser
the popular song of the moment replied the agitator after a moment's reflection
it was a tune they had all heard hundreds of times so there was no difficulty in turning out a passable imitation of it to the improvised trains of i didn't want to do it the prisoners strode forth to freedom
the word of the sound had reference it was understood the incarcerating government and not to the destroyer of the albert hall
the seat was lost after all by a narrow maturity
the local trade unionists took offense at the facts cabinet ministers having personally acted as strike breakers and even the release of platter bath failed to pacify them
with that notorious failing of his he was not a sort of person one wanted in one's house
well the failing still exists doesn't it said the husband or do you suppose a reform of character is entailed along with ida
besides cynicism apart is very rich will make a difference in the way people will look at his failing
when a man is absolutely wealthy not merely well to do all suspicion of sordid motive natural disappears the thing becomes merely a paris and malady
wilfred dijon coat had suddenly become air to his uncle serval fit pigeon coat on the death of his cousin major wilfred pigeon coat who had succumbed to the after effects of apollo accident
al wilfred vision cote had covered himself with honors in the course of marlborough's campaigns and the name loft had been above dismal weakness in the family ever since the new heir to the family dignity and estates was a young man of about five and twenty who was known more by reputation thane by person to a wite circle of cousins and kinsfolk
and the reputation was an unplaced one

i suppose is bringing us a peasant for other silver waddy good gracious
the tal fitted nervously and hurriedly from one impersonal topic to another
in the drawing room after dinner where nervousness and upwardness increased
oh we haven't shown you the silver wedding presence said missus peter suddenly as though struck by a brilliant idea of our entertaining the guest here they all are
such nice useful yes a few deprecated of course
seven queen jugs put in peter
we feel that we must live on cream for the rest of our lives
of course some of them can be changed
i put it bound by the clara of said wilfrid base with another object
vigilance was not completely crowned with a sense of victory
after they had said goodnight to their visitor missus peter expressed her conviction that he had taken something
how on earth are we to know said peter the mean pig hasn't brought us a peasant and i'm hanged if he shall carry one off
is the only thing to do
wilfrid was laid in coming down to breakfast and his manner showed plainly that something was amiss
has an unpleasant thing to have to say he blurted out presently but i'm afraid you must have a thief among your servants something's been taken out of my portmanteau
it was a little present for my mother and myself for your silver wedding
i should have given it to last night after dinner only it happened to be a cream jog and you seemed an eyed at having so many to pickets so i felt ratler awkward about givee another
thus nature had been an orphan this many years
lady ernest and pigeon cult his mother moved in circles which were entirely beyond their compass or ambitions and the sun would probably one day be an ambassador
husband and wife looked blandly and desperately at one another
it was missus peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there are thieves in the house we keep the drawing room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while we are at breakfast
she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not being stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later bearing a cream jug in her hands
the pigeon coats had turned paler than ever missus peter had a final inspiration
peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lived so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed with immeasurable distance
missus peter turned to her guest with confidential kindness
peter's little weakness a churns in the family good lord
do you mean the says ac clapt a mining like cousin's mather
very with little woman said bitter with a gasp of relief i could never have done it
and from the caring off the coast
don't cry he said i was obliged to come
and and you have not found out anything came in quick frightened tones
i wish you would believe me that i am in as great trouble about as you are
that my father is sir risdon graham as smuggled goods here
he could not help it he hated the smugglers you shall not tell
paddy pray say you will not arch you a son
then as archie stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he read the faint rustling once more and again all was simon
he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full of vexation inge ema proper as the prince caller a love of our own dignity of which archibald ry stroke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british officer had a pretty good stock
and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
cold wooer came on this idea directly as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless sit of people who would stop at nothing
no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would knock me about
the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could
to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest point and signal for help whilst boat's crew rory surging for him how to escape
the window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone sill
next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old fashioned marble mantelpiece fireplace chimney
yes if otherways failed he could escape up the chimney
no that was too bad he cannot do that
sympathy and pity for the dwellers and the hoes were completely gone now and he said his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot forever thinking about such people
a narrow table against the wall and two places
he went and tried to force his head through recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the bother would pass
but there was no chance for his body there that had would not go first
a fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
sure you look ground everywhere boy yes father quite
i'm going h to breakfast
shall i come do father no
stop here till sir wisdom tim down until among very sorry that we should have cleared our last night only a born fool saw jerry nan's lobster boat coming into the cove and came running to say it was a party from the cutter yes father
tell him not to be uneasy tis all right and i'll have everything clear away to nay
the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin or archy race stroke away with his heavy eyelids pressed down my sleep
what a queer dream he felt to himself
and how queer for mister gurr to be talking like that to anger teal the boy who helped the cook
and why did andy call mister gare father
there was an interval of thinking over this knotty question during which the low whistling went on
and i'm monger too till i was up i suppose
no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint mist hung like reeds of smoke
what did they say false alarm tell servants and they would clear all away to night see if anything had been left about lobster wrote
once out of that room he could ran and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunt him down
oh those bars he mentally exclaimed and he was advancing towards them just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of bootes against stone work and ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young minsi instead
r was the first to recover from his surprise
blow he said who eel
go round and open the door i was shot him last night by mistake
i saw you last night and wed was boy he was
it was you father kicked for shirking and my well i hardly knowed you
nonsense
won't do said remembering
think i don't know you mister orficer
won't do said rod quickly i know you
been flying the spire t where you b noon we locked you in
archie stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
he has gone to give the alarm about the prisoner and he looked excitedly round for a way of escape
nothing but the chimney presented itself
a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curved dirk glanced at the edge ran to the window and began to cut at one of the bars labor in vain
he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks in grating sounds as he realized that the attempt was madness
the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear a selling sound as he found that now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the durk into it sheath
no we can't part with that ha ha ha laughed the boy jeeringly
for now yes i'll give you a guinea if he will let me out
guinea said the boy think i'll do it for a guinea wed them too
be quick there's a good fall i want to get away at once
cannot you only a sham
why your clothes don't fit you when your caps put on all scherer
never mind about that let me out of this place
i told you a fisher boy cried arch impatiently but trying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
not you look like a wild beast in a cage like a monkey you insolent
archie checked himself and the boy laughed
it was your turn yesterday it's mine to day what a game
you laughed and cleared at me when i was on the cutter's deck
i say you do with wake lemon just like a big mogi and show
ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long low fit of laughter
you rope send me he said
why i could tire you up and a knot and heave you or fickle any day what a game
bit of a made he fed on a salt tack and medley biscuit talk of giving me ropes and
once more will you come and let me out no
to his astonishment the boy did not flinch but thrust his own arms through replacing him about the middy's waist clenching his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle

he was sharp lookout on the cliff to see with j raystoke his making signals for a boat

at last a little till they could bear these ay no longer
but away the men to that boat there he said is the cru brannan

to return away impatiently again and signing to his men to follow they all began to tramp up a steep check leading towards the hose that the rabbits scuttling away among the furs and showing their white conny tails for a moment as they darted down into their holes
i dunno im one of dick and the men can't be sure

the miller and i crossed the bridge the three were on some dry good boxes at the corner near the bank and as soon as they saw us went right into the bank instead of waiting for us to get there
when we came up i told mill if he shot the bank door which they had left open in their hurry
jes hallen whose hard worse store was near try to go into the bank but miller ordered him away and you ran around the corner shouting
get your gon boys they're robbing the bank
and i called to him to get inside at the same time firing a pistol shout in the air as the signals to the three boys at the bridge that we had been discovered
almost at this instant i heard a pistol shot in the bank
shadwell woods and jim rode up and joind us shouting to the people in the street to get inside and firing their pistols to emphasize their commands
if any of our party shot him it must have been woods
meantime the street was getting uncomfortably hot
every time i saw anyone would a beat on me i would drop off my horse and try to drive the sheet inside but i could not see in every direction
doctor wheeler who had gone upstairs in the hotel shoot miller and he lay dying in the street
changing his pistol to his left hand bob ran out and mounted miller's mayor

sheriff crispin of water one county who was taking bob's pistol from him was also shouting to the fellow
including those received in and on the way from nor field i have eleven wounds
and sheriff lisp in's order not to sheet was the beginning of the protector that minnesota people established over us
captain murdock
but mars port had flourished enough to kill it off
some of mar's laws dated from the time when law force ment had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
the stonewall gang numbered perhaps five hundred
even dar ax and failures had to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which eked out some kind of a marginal living
they were safe from protection rocketeers there none bothered to come so far out
the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
captain murdock was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
the pressure was enough to get them for him
gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
i've got a free hand and we're going to run this the way we would on earth
your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
the first man making a shakedown we'll get the same treatment we're going to use on the stone wall boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
he picked out five of the men include in gordon you five will come with me
the rest of you can teem up anyway you want tonight pick any route that's open though came in let's go
bruce gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick and murdock's eyes fell on him earth copp
two years gordon admitted
for a second gordon cursed himself
he began wondering about security then
nobody had tried to get in touch with him
there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim phosphoric bulb glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
moving in two groups of threes at opposite sides of the street they began their beat
there was no chance to save the citizen who was drying from lac of air
gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands
corn's eyes popped at that
he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
the other four cops had come in reluctantly
he brought him to the ground with a single blow crossed the kidneys
they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cups started off
to find a phone and call the wagon
we're not using wagons murdock told him lying them up
if they tried to run they were hit from behind yet they stood still they were clubbed carefully
murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulder shaking in tears running down his cheeks
the captain's face was as sick as gordon's felt
i want the name of every man and the gang you can remember he told the men
colonel they kill me i don't know
murdock took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tufts
if he should turn up dead i'll know you boys responsible and i'll find you
trouble began brewing shortly after though
murdock sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of sixth and then a third
and the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men had been beaten before
get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he wor
but the captain stirred finally sighing
now the copse are giving me were covered gordon
but the stone wall gang is backing wain
but it's goin to be tough on them
bruce gordon grimaced i've got a yellow ticket from security
murdock blinked he dropped his eyes slowly
what makes you think wain will be re elected
nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
ever see a martian election
no you're a first rud he can't lose
and then hell is going to pop and this whole planet may be blown wide open
it fitted with the dire predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner
cost a more but they be respectable
because issy is always honest according to have he sees it
but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
the groups grew more experienced and murdock was training a new squad every night
it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
this could lead to abuses as he'd seen on earth
but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor wan was re elected
it was night outside and the phosphoric of the corners glowed dim lain giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporised precinct toast
it had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down
and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that hayley's system was working
gordon hit the signal switch and the marsh speaker let out a shrill whistle
gunn suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
you can't do it to me
i'm reformed i'm going straight
you damned cops kent o ya was blubbering
one look was enough the work papers had the tell tail over thickening of the signature they had showed up on other papers obviously forgeries
some turned away as gordon and the other cop went to work but most of them weren't squeamish
when it was over the two picked up their whimpering captive
chickens the other cup had been holding the wallet
must have been making a big contact in something fifty fifty
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
when gordon and jenkins came back murdock tossed the money to them split it
whatever comes to hand gov'nor
like this social call a gordon asked him
the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober nope
you are me some bells gov'nor
eleven hundred fifty credits
you didn't pay up your pledge to the captain fund so i had a fill in
a thousand interest at ten percent a week standard right
gordon had heard of the friendly interest charge on the side here but he shook his head wrong is he
ha is he turned it over and shook his head
now show me where i signed any agreement saying i'd pay you back
first second izzie's face went blank then he chuckled
he poured out the bills and handed them over
thanks his he thanks yourself
the kid pocketed the money cheerfully nodding
the little guy knew mars as few others did apparently from all sides
and if any of the other cops had private rackets of their own is he was undoubtedly the man to find it out and used the information with a beat such as that even going halves and with all the graft to the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped into the bench
go on except dem it
there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
the little publisher was back at the crusader again
only gordon and she lo were left
credit had been established again and the businesses we open
gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwellings built like the dome but opaque for privacy
they have been lucky
shoolbred's volunteers were official now
bat's place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
he reached automatically for the class of ether needle beer
thought ye'd be in the chips
that's mars gord knacker the others comment why don't you pull off the planet fats you could go back to earth i'd guess the father nodded
guess a man gets used to anything hell maybee i can hire some bumps to sit around and whoop it up when the ships come in and bill this is a real old martian den of sin
there was a grin on the other's face
finally got our orders for you it's mercury
we sent to twenty others a same way and they failed
let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
you can't stay here
there's a rocket waiting to tranship you to the man on the way to mercury right now gordon sighed
and i paid her the pay we owe you from the time you begin using your beds she's up shopping
but his old eyes were glinting
did you think we'd let you go without seeing off copper he asked
i i oh dreaded i'm getting old is he you tell him
he grabbed gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank as he shook his head
elly colchester had begun to make prince with leslie
leslie determined to tripe upon us in english language and literature
their tastes all lay illustration her idea being by and by to follow her mother's proficient with jervis for which he already showed considerable aptitude
she had no idea of allowing herself to break down
what do you mean replied leslie
what you will be parting from me you know
i would be the constant worry and plague of your life
it is this if by any chance you don't leave say words annie i hope you will allow me to be a roomfellow again next term
said annie a flash of light coming into her eyes and then leaving him
but she added abruptly you speak of something which must not take place
i must pass an honours if i don't i shall die
a few moments later there came a tap at the door
leslie opened the door
jane harriet stood without
these letters have just come for you and ony colchester she said and as i was come upstairs i thought i would leave them with you
vasily thanked her and eagerly grasped the little passer
her eyes shone with pleasure at the anticipation of the delightful time she would have reveling in the home news the other letter was directed to edie colchester
here is a letter for you annie cried leslie
her face grew suddenly watches death what is it dear
i have been starling or rather i have been thirsting
well read it in peace said ladles i won't disturb you
i am truly glad it has come
leslie seated herself with her back to her companion and opened her own letters
don't notice me replied anny
i must go into the grounds the air is stifling
but they are just shutting up
i shall go i know away
just after midnight she rose with a sigh to prepare for bed
she looked round the room
now remember she got a letter which upset her very much and went out
leslie went to the window and flung it open she put her head out and tried to peer into the darkness but the moon had already said and she could not see more than a couple of yards in front of her
she is a fery queer the rated creature and that litter there was bad news in their litter
what can't you doing out by herself
this le lit the room but she had scarcely gone a dozen places downed the corridor before she met any returning
and hiss eyes were very bright her cheeks were no longer pale and there was a brilliant color on them
she did not take the least notice of easing but going into the room shut the door
don't begin said anny
don't again what do you mean
i mean that i don't want you to begin to ask questions
i walked up and down as fast as ever i could outside in order to make myself sleepy
go talk to me leslie don't see a single word
i shall go off to sleep that is all i careful
don't said any
now princess at once she said in a voice of authority if you really wish to sleep
annie steered vacantly at the cocoa then she uttered a laugh
drink dead she said
do you want to kill me don't talk any more
i am sleeping i shall sleep
she got into bit as she spoke and wrapped the cloaks cutty round her
cut you manage with a candle just for once
certainly said yerly
she turned off the light and litter candle which she put behind a screen then prepared to get ino beard
emmy's manner was very mysterious
annie did not meet to confine anyone that night and the kindest thing was to leap her alone
tie it out listening yourself cropped asleep
edie is that you she called out
there was no reply but the sound of prying steps came quicker and quicker now and then though interrupted by a groan
o this will kill me my heart breach this will kill me
the gold of saint elizabeth
immediately after dear that evening leslie ran up to her room to make preparations for a visit to east hall
i'm not coming said a
every student is to be in east hall at half past eight
it doesn't matter replied annie whether it is in order or not i'm not coming say nothing about me please
it burned as if with fever
you don't know what a child it is for me tack you here
i want be avert go
i know you don't quite me what you say said leslie but of course if you really wish me
you fret me beyond endurance
wrapping a pretty blue shawl round hidden shoulders she turned to any
leslie was just closing that all behind her when annie called after her
