there's iron they say in all our blood and a grain or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
margaret said mister hale as he returned from showing his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thornton made his confession of having been a shop boy
you don't mean that you thought me so silly
i really like that account of himself bettern than anything else he said
his statement of having been a shopboy was the thing i like best of all
you who were always accusing people of being shoppy at helstone
i don't think mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some part of what he said
his father dying in miserable circumstances
why it might have been in the workhouse
his father speculated wildly failed and then kill himself because he could not better disgrace
all his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
no one came forwards to help the mother and this boy
at least no friend came forwards immediately and miss thornton is not wont i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
so they left milton
how tainted asked of father
ap paa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade in making money
and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his ion nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
not vicious he never said that
improvident and self indulgent were his words
margaret was collecting her mother's working the terrors and preparing to go to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
however out it came
paa i do think mister thornton a very remarkable man but purse me i don't like him at all
am i do said her father laughing
first me as you call it and all
i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
but good night child
there was several other science of something wrong about missus hale
she and dixon held mysterious consultations in a bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was a custom when any distress of her mistress called upon her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dixon lifted and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a fewer words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
but though she received presses and f words back again in touch profusion as would have gladden her formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health'
she lay awa very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
a servant give dixon permanent assistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attentions she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
visiting register officers seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she met bessy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
well busy how are you
better and not better if you know what that means
not exactly replied margaret smiling
i'm better in not being torn to pieces by coughing or nights but i'm weary and tired of milton and longing to get away to the landor boola and when i think i'm father and farther off my heart sinks none no better i'm worse
margaret turned round to walk long side of the girl in her feeble progress homewards
but for a minute or two she did not speak
at last she said in a low voice
busy dish to die
bessy was silent in her turn from a minute or two then she replied
not worse than many others are reckon
but what was it
you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quicker understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton
i had forgotten when i said for the time continued margaret quietly
i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i'll go with you now
the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
as they turned up into a small court opening out into a scold street bessy said
you will not be daunted to father's at home and speaks a bit gaff ash at first
but nicholas was not at home when they entered
past bessy at last
bessy took a long and feverish draught and then fell back and shut her eyes
margaret bent og and said bessy don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or may have been
remember who gave it to you and made it what it is
now i'll not have my wench preach to
but surely said margaret facing round yee believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of laugh it was to be
i believe works he enormous
that's what i believe young woman
i don't believe all i hear no not by big deal
but whose come at last and whose welcome as long as who will keep from preaching on what who knows not about
its simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work
but the girl and you pleaded the mole was margaret
tring hardly on him is a good man he is
i sometimes think i shall be murk with sorrow even in the city of god if other is not there
the feverish collar came into her cheeks and the feverish flame into eye
but you'll be the father yee shall o heart
she put her ha to it and became ghastly pale
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
presently the spasm that fore shuddered death had passed away and bie roused the soft and said
i'll go to bed it's best place but catching at margaret's gown yo'll come again i know you will but just say it
oh come to morrow said margaret
margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
she was late for tea at home

everybody also had they turn up this great difficulty now let me try
i may be the cinderella to put on the slipper after all
what would you do papa h would you set about him
why i would apply to some good house mother to recommend me one known to herself or her service
very good but we must first catch our house mother
the mother of him he spoke to us said margaret
mister thornton the only mother he has i believe said mister hale quietly
i shall like to see her she must be an uncommon person her mother added
perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
she sounded to be such careful economical person that i should like anyone out of the same family
my dear said mister hale well armed don't go off on that idea
i'm sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
take notice that this is not my kind of fortin papa if i have any at all which i own agree to are you always accusing me of it
i don't know positively that it is her either but from little things i've gathered from him a fancy sir

dicky was well of questions but mister be l no answers were them
nor was its sunday on which they took a rest and washed their shirts according to mister beale's rule of life
they did not stay there but walked out across the dance where the skylights were singing and on a dip of the downs came upon great stone wards and towers were a strong and gray
what's that there said dicky
replied he of a truth i heard him not and i wing not and folks are all sleeping
but she said whomsoever thou seest awake hes the reciter
then said the eunuch art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him
rejoined the eunuch who then was the reciter point him out to me
by allah replied the firemen i tell thee the truth
tell me what happened whats ahaa khan
what ails thee then that thou must needs reside verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the fork are asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
and he also improvised the too following this stitch
when nuzhat al zaman heard the first improvisation she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their wm home then she wept and cried to the eunuch and said to him wo to thee
he who recited the first time hath society the second dime and heard him hard by
by allah an thou fatch him not to me i will assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee and yee shall beat thee and cast thee ya
but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt
returned quickly and linger not
when it was the seventy third nine
but the yok said i will not leave thee til thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returning to my lady without him
now when the fireman heard these words he feared for twa machan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch by allah it was not i and they know him not
so go thou to thy station and if thou gave meet anyone after this hour reciting aught of paltry whether he be near or far it will be i or someone i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me
then he kissed the hope's head and spake him fair till he went away but a castrato fetched around and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
i say what made my ignoring what have the beater cap i drain far be from me thy land to flee nor will i bow to those who blame and for such love would deal me shame
then said the eunuch to zu makan be we with thee o my lord
o my lord continued the eunuch and shahrazad perceived at the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
we will do thee no upright o my son nor wrong thee in aught but our object is that thou bend th gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and returning weal and safety and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news
then the eunuch went out to sal machan and said to him recite what verses thou knowest for my ladies here hart by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition
and also these
then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit
when the eunuch sawed these case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
after awhile they came to themselves and zat al zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the kun and what had happened to her with the badawi how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brothers shar can and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of bye how he had made her marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the king their sire had sent and asked for her from sharrkan
but now go to thy master and break him quickly to me
the chamberlain called the castrato and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the talker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girding his ass and preparing for flight
she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the talker girted his ass for flight and bespake himself saying oh would i knew what is become of him
i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence these pages at about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime
why didst thou say i never repeated these couplets nor do i know who remitted them when it was it thy companion
but now i will not leave thee between this place and that dad and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee
was as i feared the communal is discerning but to allah we are all returning
then the eunuch cried upon the pages saying take him off the ass
and he answered i am the chamberlain of the mere of damascus king sharpen sang omar bin al new woman lord bagdad and of the land of khorasan and i bring tribute and presence from him to his fathering bad dad
so fairy forwards no harm shall befall you till you join his grant wazir than done
then he bade him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was chamberlain to the emir of damascus and was bound to king gar with presents and the tribute of syria
so was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the king's son sharpen and may came sultan over his father's rail
and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet zo machan for quoth they his name be light of the place and he hath a sister nuzhat al zaman hies the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for ahijah and none wotteth what is become of them
so he turned to the wazir gan and said to him readily your tale is a wonder of wonders
know o chief wazir that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions for let his almighty will restore it to you zo makan and his sister nuzhat al zaman whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can
when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the twain and what befell them and the cause of their long absence
zoram kan bowed his head awhile and then said i accepted the position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and sat him on the right way
then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharpen
after awhile the dust dispersed and he appeared under it the army of bagdad and khorasan a conquering host like the pool tide sea and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
when it was the seventy eighth night
andy neat or rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place
lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zau makan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and sires san speer
moreover the sultan commanded his wazir done call at ten days halt of the army that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain
he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days

mister marble he ought to breed was fairy's newsy on the hin coops bringing him like the sailors as one might say very asleep
at that moment ad a noise when the marriage you semen that of an oar falling in the boat
i think yet zeal ho and close abroad
he regiments of the seamen to require second look in ordered to ascertain but it was to be none
on though they went three feet two hour two this gave it s moment of freezing time
as our seat were off flying forward remained so for a few minutes be game me a leisure to look about
i soon saw both pross in glad enough was i should perceive that they had not a prose merrily near
mister cat served it saws remarked that ar movements had been so prompt as taint the raskil
a print off still it seceded
the pros did not alter the course but near dutch fast
i heard the ratting of the boarding pipes too as they were cut adrift from the spanker boom and fell upon the decks
kind lent out and re turned with three or four muskets and as many pipes
the still in its that ranged boat sides was might that of depth
the john behaved beauti frey he came round like attar
the question was now whether we could pass them were not for they got noon up to grapple
and captain behave perfectly way its critic rud and commanding a dead snouts its intenser to his orders
now so bored the jar heart
one our san gave the gentleman the four seeks to out the news into it the stern most proven which with deal near a tables length that it sent
they were night the yos of fiends in english

that state the ship pats ahead of her candidates being for leaving the pro most in its in her wake
they swarmed up in front of sirr's palings as thick as they could jan together and you couldn't hear yoursel think for the noise
some sung out paired out the fence tear down the fence
the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
sherbet run his eyes slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little de out gaze em but they couldn't they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
the average man's of coward
because they're afraid the man's friends will shoe them in the back in the dark and it's just what they would do
so they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with a hundred mast cowards at his back and lunches the rascal
you didn't want to come
but a mob without any man at the head of it his beneath pitifulness
now lead and take your half a man with you tasso he is gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
the crowds washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harness he healed it after them looking tolerable cheek
he can't b keith careful
they argued en tried to keep him out but he wouldn't listen an a whole show come to stand still
and one or two women begin to scream
so then the ring master he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could s stay on the horse
it warn't funny to me though i was all but tremble to see his danger
and a horse a going like a house a fire or to
he shed him so thick that kind of clod up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits
why it was one of his own min
an but never mind ar rest of his outfit it was jest white but it was awful funny
the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and haw hor till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do another time
twenty people sings out
the duke says yes
everybody sings out sold
but a big fine lookin man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on
jest a word gentlemen they stopped to listen
what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up and sell the rest o the town
you bade it is the judge is right everybody sings out
we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding downstream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
we never show light till we was about ten mile below the village
green horns flat heads

take em all around they're a mighty ornery light it's the way theyre raised
well theyll do jim
now to do he's a tolerable like of man in some ways
this one's a middlin hard lot for a duke
when i waked up jest at daybreak he was setting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and mornin d himself
it don't seem natural but i reckon it so
he was often moning in morning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying oh little lisbeth
don't you hear me shut dado
i lay i make you mine
jist as loud as i could yell
which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to howl
the kan's duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy
why before he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when he'd take off his new white beaver an make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good an pious that you'd say he'd walk right out of the ark and maybe was og a vitiges himself
jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my pile ready
were you bound or young man
get aboard says the king
i done so and then we all three started on again
the young chat was mighty thankful city was tough work toting his baggage such weather
p asked the king where he was goin an the king told em he'd come down a river and landed at the other village this mornin and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there the young fellow says
but then i says again no i reckon it ain't him or else he wouldn't be paddling u the rib you ain't him or you
no my name's oblige it alexander oblige reverend alexander oblige it i s'pose i must say as im worn of the large poor servants
you see he was pretty old an george's good earls was too younger be much company for him except mary janey red hitting and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didn't seem to care much to lit

mary janes nineteen susans fifteen an joanna is about fourteen that's the one it gives herself to good works and has a hair lit p or things

flam defeated in acquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkes and about peter's business which was a tanner and about george's which was a carpenter and about harvest which was a dissenting minister and so on and so on then he says
when her deep they won't stop for a hail
was peter wilts well off
when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got all
now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags
so then they waded for a steamboat
but the king was car he says
they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would they tell you
they wanted them says kind o soften jen
phelps is one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look alike
i went around and climb over the back stile by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen
i out with a yes'm fore i thought
so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
when we got there she set me down in a split bottom chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
well it's lucky because sometimes people do git hurt
an i think he'd died afterwards he wuz a baptist
yes it was mortification that was it
your uncle's been up to the town everyday to fetch you
you must have met him on the road didn't you ogres man with a
why child it'll be stow
it was kinder thin eyes but i says
i had my mind on the children all a time i wanted to git them out to one side and pumped them a little to find out who i was
pretty soon she made the cold chill streak all down by back because she says
i see it warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
so i says to myself here's another place where i got to rest the truth
i open my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes
children don't you say a word
i see i was in a fixed now
missus phelps she jilts for him and says
has he come no says her husband
i can't imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy
uneasy she says i'm ready to go distracted
he must a come and you've missed him along a road
oh don't distress me any more numb already distressed
why silas look yonder up the road ain't that somebody comin
the old gentleman stared and says
i hain't no idea who is it
is tom sawyer
being time sawyer was easy and comfortable an its stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river
then i says to myself s'pose time sawyer comes dan on that boat
but i am you please that you have seen my lady
i knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
her conversation has more charms than can be in mere beauty and a humour and disposition would make a deform person appear lovely
why didn you not send me that news and a garland
why the best on it i have a squireen that is as good as in knight
in earnest we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish an occasions as i cannot tell which is strangers
all the people that i had ever and my life refused were brought again upon the stage like richard the third's ghosts to reproach me withal and all the kindness discoveries could make i had for you was late to my charge
my best qualities if i have any that are good served but for aggravations of my fault and i was allowed to have wit and understanding a discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in this
tis a strange change and i'm very sorry for it but i'll swearing or not how to help it
mister fish is a squire of things and has so many mistresses than anybody may pretend to share in him and re believed that though i have the honour to be his near neighbour to speak freely i cannot brag much that he makes an e court to me and i know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often
i think my youngest brother comes down with him
i can no sooner give you some little hints whereabout they live but you know them presently anent you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if i inclining to look graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
i have missed four fits and have had but five and have recovered so much strength as may be venture to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
but besides i can give you others
i am here much more out of people's way than in town when my aunts and such as pretend and interest in me in a power over me do so persecute ment dear good nature i'll take it so ill that they are not accepted as i would live in a hor tree to avoid them
youd think him altered and if it be possible more melancholy than he was
if marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him i shall pray that all my friends may escape it
well in earnest if i were prince that lady should be my mistress but i can give no rule to anyone else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing their hearts to her may be infinitely taken with one i should not value at all for so a justinian wise providence has ordained it that by their different humours everybody might find something to please themselves withal without envying their neighbours
the matter is not grain for i confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best please never to be known in it one any occasions whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly avoided one must satisfy oneself by doing nothing that one need care knows
if i had a picture that will fit for you he should have it
how can you talk of de flying fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you could
i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am certain he knows utmost of the injuries you have received from her
we have had another to beat but much more calmly
then besides there was a time when we ourselves when different to one another did i do so then or have i learned it since
i have been studying how tom cheek might come by his intelligence and i very believe he has it from my cousin peters
how kindly do i take the civilities of your fathers in earnest you cannot imagine how his letter appease me
would it would leave me and then i could believe i shall not always avocation for it
by poor lady vavasor is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against a protector and did not discover it
she has told now all that was told her but vows she will never say from whence she a it we shall see whether her resolutions ars unalterable as those of my lady calash
i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
i never saw anyone yet that did not look sinking and out of countenance now ever knew a wedding well design but one and that was of two persons time enough i confess to contrive it and nobody the prison amid themselves
the truth is i could not endure to be missus bride in a public wedding we made the happiest person on earth
do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather than fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
yet in earnest your father will not find my brother pate in wanting and civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters to me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set a higher value upon her sister and she deserves
my aunt told me no longer gone in yesterday that i was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome t heeded
you see i give you fell warning
by the next i shall be gone into kent in my other journeys laid aside which i am not displeased at because it would have broken o intercourse very much
here are some buses of colonies tell me all you like them
i told you in my last that my sufficed journey was made aside and i into kent hastened
if i drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will i bequeath all my kindness to you in it for a charge never to b stowed all upon another mistress lest my ghost rise again and haunt you
indeed i like him extremely and he is commended to me by people that know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than they i did not intend it so though i can assure you
i do not find it i am told i was so extremely when i believed you love me
but i am called upon
directed for your master
i see you can chid when you please and with authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded for a very good principle in me
we dare not that our tongues lie more on one side of our moths and the other for fear of overturning it
you are satisfied i hope and this that i escape drowning
but i am troubled much you should make so ill a journey to sore little purpose indeed i writ by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters
oh welcome you will be but alas
for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to no decay an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission
they laugh to hear me say that one unkind word destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase everyday if it were possible but never lessen
we go broad all day and play all night and see our praise when weet time
well in silver earnest now i would not live thus a twelvemonths to gain all that came has lost unless it were to give it him again
will you be so good nature
he has one son it sis the finest boy that e saw and has a noble spirit but yet stands in that all of his father that one word from him is as much as twenty whippings
you must give me leave to entertain you else with discourses of the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
not to knowing you would come home i can assure you nor for any other cas on my own but with a cousin of m that had long designed to make herself spot with him and did not miss of her aim
in my life i never heard so ridiculous and discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
ever since this adventure i have had so great belief in all things for this nature that i could not forbear laying a peas caught with nine peas int under my door yesterday it was informed by it that my husband's name should be thomas how do you like that
she put her head down turned his good back put her feet in the fender and took patter into her lap all of it arrangements signified that something very important had got to be thought over and settled
the more propos was the more created
i tight it unlighted and maybe desist the consequence of that night's fun
just suppose it is true that he does ask me and i yes
what a spiteful thing i am
i do so much for all at home how i should quid that
that me see how can i begin
it has known her all her life and has a good influence over her
now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once the weak for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided she missed the pleasant little interviews that used to put a certain flavour of moments into her thar hardworking days
i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that knows detracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected
it was that indescribable of something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been pressed with wise in good mothers
this had an especial charm to polly for she soon found that this sight of his character was not shown to everyone
lately this had changed especially towards parley and it filled her more than she would confess even to herself
at first she tried to think she could that unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even gratitude
party felt a very cordial friendship for mister sydney but not one particle of the law detected only kind in which laugh can maturely paid
this finished polly's indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl that the spies of the old eve in her composition
when set it tay came polly started as usual for visit to back hey and best but good n resist stopping at the shores to leave lily pass of a fen that was calling time
a foolish little speech to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tender heeded girl trying to her duty
take hold of massa charley's hand miss maybee and b pretty like willie and flossy said the mate
at the street corner a black eyed schoolboy was parting from a rosy faced school girl whose music role he was reluctantly slandering
how he got there was never very clear to puny but there he was flushed and a little out of crep but looking so glad to see her till she had not the heart a p stiff and cool as she had fully intended to be when they meet
she rey could not help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
that is the way i get the was answered polly
she did not mean to tell but as fright this was so agreeable she forgot herself
but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she choice to mend her thoughts though she won't own it and who sprise you some day by the amount of heart and sense and goodness she has got
thank you no
her lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
as the out for young man laying a trap into which polly immediately fell
he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being both wailed and generous resolved to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as palace's own
so and you made a last poy and remark he said quietly watching your face keenly all the wire i thought so ba i'm going out of town and business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me anno it
she thought she had a good deal of the coquette in her and i've no doubted with time and draining she would have become a very dangerous th person but now she was far to transparent and straightforward by nature even to tell a wide like level
he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorse for face and she walked on feeling that the first in perhaps the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and excepted een servants
parley did not return to a favourite walk till she learned for minnie that uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the ways so pleasant after
lugging too and f as usual what's the news with you
perhaps she showed him
utterly done with and laid upon the shelf
minnie said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the bottles and that fuss above revels
now don't be affected polly but just tell me like a dear has not he proposed
don't you think he means to
truly truly fair
i don't mean to be prying but i really thought he did
oh i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have
i just gave him the hint and he took it
he meant to go away before that so them think his heart is broken or mind what city tatler say
he understood and being a gentleman made no farce
but parry it would have been a grand thing for you
i'm not you know i prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days
never mind what the business was its surfaces to say that it was a good beginning for young men like town who having been borne and bad in the most conservative class of the most conceited city in your england needed just the healthy hearty social influences of the rest to frighten his views and make a man of him
fortunately everyone was so busy with the messy probations that there was no time for romans of any sort and the four young people worked together as soberly insensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not bottled up in their respective hurts
pity that the end should come so soon but the hour did its work and wend its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind but the young fox did not see them for their ice within because of the partings that must be
if it had not been for two things i fear she liver would have stood a summer in town but sydney often called to his vacation came and a voluminous class bonds of parley beguiled belong days
time weld ones a we to his mother but the letters were short and not very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best liked to hear
no i'm only tired had a good deal to do lately and the doll weather mixed me chest the ter brew
forgive me polly but i can't he saying it for is there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can
i du i never deceive myself but it does seem us if there was a chance of happiness for me
thank heaven for that
cried polly with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice
poor parley was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say
none were needed her told her face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish aster and the hundreds are after it
once or t ee but sort of chokingly and i thought it was only some little flotation
it wass could of me not a guess before
it was so tender earnest and defiant but fanny forgot the defence of her own lover and admiration of polls loyalty to hers for this faithful all ab sobbing laugh was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friends boast of two or three lover a year and calculate their respective fir use with almost as much coolness as the young men discussed fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to mary
i hope maria baileys only thinks she added softly i could not bear to happen disappointed again
said fanny turning hope for all at once
suppose i say a word to tim just inquire after his heart in a general a way you know and' give him a chance to tell me if there's anything to tell
bar it people always to par thing somehow answered polly looking as if sentence had been passed upon her
it was a very different window from the last above the girls
if anny wondered to show him what she could do towards making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded b than she suspected for spite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mister sydney at least for he was more the house friend than ever and seemed determined approve the change of fortune made not difference to him
she kept much at home when the day's work was done finding it pleasantly to the dreaming of a book or soon alone than to exert herself even to go to the shores
polly was not at all like herself that window and those news to her saw invented at it most
for ned was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole baily question and left them in other darkness
fanny came bagging in the pony one day looking as if she poured tidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them
but if work baskets were gied with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any read
she had even been in society before the revolution
it was her pleasure and her vanity to dragon these names on every pretext
every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monseigneur saint francois gave it monsignor sa julian monseigneur saint julian gave it to monseigneur saint economies gave to monseigneur sain procopius et c her et cetera
and the schoolgirls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under the bales charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers from
it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
the rule of foure val did not forbid this
she would not show the subject tow anyone
thus that furnished a subject of comment for all those who were on occupied or bored in the convent
some unique chaplet some authentic relic
they lost themselves in conjectures
wh the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making and effort to fly but the dancer is laughing with a satanic air
moral love conquered by the colic
the priors returned and seated herself once more hon tire

you will raise the stone with the barrow by means of the ring but
the dead must be obeyed to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother crucifixion
she asked it of us that is to say commanded us
but it is forbidden
oh i am a stone in your walls
think father for then if she were to work miracles here

general observations on preserves confectionery ices and dessert dishes
the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious subjection for excepted sugar is used in considerable qualities the success is very uncertain
flit gathered in whet or fog y you weather will soon bewildered and give no service for preserves
but to distinguish these probably replies very great attention and considerable experience
if you dip the finger into the serf and a plight to the thumbs the tenacity of the serf will on separating the finger and thumbs afford thread which shortly breaks this is the little thread
read it boil up again then take it off and remove carefully the scum that h risen
it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil
before sugar was use honey was employed pres of many vegetable productions though the substance was now human way to the juice of the sugarcane
fourteen no danin
bore them m three days successively stemming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use
the reason that offer is emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
from this example the process of preserving fruits by sirup would be easily comprehended
they should be dried in the stove or oven on a sea and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time there turned
in this way it is also that orange and women ships are preserved
marmalades james and fruit past are the same nature and are now in they general quest
mar lite and jams differ little from each other there preserves of half liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits i'm sometimes part of the wines with sugar
that they may keep it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen o three
in all the operations for preserve making when the preserving pan is used as should not be placed on the fire but on a tribute unless the joe is meane on a hot plate when this is not necessary
confectionery fifteen o eight
in speaking of confectionery should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head for the various fruits flowers herb whose in juices which one board with sugar were formerly employed in pharmacy as well as a sweetmeats were called confections from the latin worth confer s to make up but the term confectionery embraces of very large class indeed of sweet food many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary quesnel
a thousand and one ornamental dishes that had done the tables of the wealthy should re purchase from the confectioner they cannot profitably be made at home
however as late as the reign of our two last george's fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts
the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems
ices
a deserts or at some evening parties ices are scarcely lat be dispensed with
the s battle is generally made of copper kept bright and clean
they should be taken immediately after the repast or some hours after because the taking of these substances dulling the process of digestion is apt to provoke indisposition
there was once on the time a widower who had a sodden and the daughter by his first wife
from the very gave it the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the man's children and not a corner to be found what they could get any rest so the boy thought that the best thing he could do was too plad into the world and try ton his own bread
but his sister who was still at home fared wards and worse
tis me go said dad
when the king entred and saw he stood still as if he were in fetters and could not stir from the spot when the picture seemed to him so beautiful
these promised to make all the haste he could and set forth from the tim's palace
at last they came in sight of land
while if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her casket into the sea
what is my brother saying asked his sister again
on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchenmaid who slept there to lend her a brush
she begged very prettily and got it and then she bushed her hair and the gold dropped from it
out on the ugly bushy brides sleeping so soft of the young king's side on sanding stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with the cold snake unpitied and unwept
i shall come twice more and then never again said she
this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she s the doll gout three times and when day dawned she departed but if she was going she said as she had said before i shall come once more and then never again
no one can tell how the light of the king was to get rid of that hideous bushy bride and get a queen who was bright and beautifulest day itself
wilt thot serve me on what my seven fools as the king
the youse thought that it was very easy word to wash the folds and he could do well enough
hast thou watched faithfully and well the whole day long said the king when the lad came into his presence in the evening
yes that i h said the youth
he had gone at once to seek a place he said but never would he do such a thing again
the necking promised in the same punishment and the same rewards to a few polishes brother
when he had run after the fools for a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by clef in the rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with the distant and she called to him
come either come hither my handsome son and let me comb your hair
the youth liked the thought of this let the hold were where they chose and seated himself in the cleft of the rock by the side of the old hag
so then he sat with his head on her lap taking his ease the live long day
on the third day set the lad wanted to set at
the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go but all to no purpose and sind ladd set out on his way
i am marking about and so to a place said sind lad
i would much rather have the princess said cinder lad
and thus they journeyed onwards a long long way
when they had gone thus for a long long way the full again us dost thou see anything now
yes now i see something that his wife had sind the lad
it loos like a chalk of a great thick birch tree
signory tri but could not do it so he had to take a dooty and then one more and after that still another and then he was able to be over sword with perfect ease
for we have brother said the princess whom now are to have when thou kids tell the king what we eaten drink but there is a mighty tool whose has to spell over us
when they had ted a long long way the fore said just not see anything
and now quite a fole seest th nothing now
now though said the fool dost thou not see anything now
that is oliver said the full and we have to cross it
i have done my best replied singer lad
once upon a time there was a king in the north hope one many wars but now he was old
the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
so yes the queen how do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning and she said
then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
he is no bigger than other dragon said the tutor and if you were as very your father you would not fear him
then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dwarf who waned all the treasure and took it from him
all the one ring was left which the dwarf wore and even that was taken from him
so rigging made a sword and cigar tried it with a blow in a lump of iron and the sword broke
then sigurd went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's blade and gave them to regin
so sigurd said that sword would do
then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley
but sigurd waited till halfs of him had called over the pit and then he thrust the sword graham right unto his very heart
sigurd said i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
but all men die and no brave man lets death frightened him from his desire
guy thou fafner and then staff ner died
then cigar growed back and met regin and riggin asked him to roast fafner it's heart and let him taste of it
sissy gould put the heart of fafner on mistake and roasted it
there's sigurd roasting pater's heart for another when he should taste of it himself and learn all wisdom
that let him do then ride over hin feld to the place were brunhild sleeps
there must she sleep till thou comes for her waking rise up in ry for now sure she will swear the vow fearlessly breaking
then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper had behold she was a most beautiful lady
then sigurd rode away and he came to the house of a king who had a fair daughter
limb burne hild father told gunner that she would marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower and that v they rode and gutter fit his horse at the flame but he would not face it
for one day when bourn hilding gudgeon were bathing burn held waved farther sou into the river and said she did that to show she was gundry superior
for her husband she said had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it
not long to wait he said till the bitter sword stands fast in my heart and thou will not live long when i am dead

but pacific crayfish ist is every purpose and while many content that its meat is not so delicate flavor as out of its eastern cousin the californian was strenuously insists that it is better but of course something must always be allowed for the patriotism of the caloric

i swear answered sancho
i say so continued don quixote because i hate taking away anyone's good n
i say replied sancho that i swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship stays and gone great i may be able to let it out to morrow
though your worship was not so badly having in you on see comparable beauty you spoke of and i what did i have except the heaviest wax that i think i had in all my life
unlucky me ino muted at barbe
didn't i see so worse luck to my line said sancho
it cannot be the more answered don quixote but those under enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone
if they do not let themselves be seen they let themselves be felt said sancho if not let my shoulder speak to the point
m c speak too said don quixote but that is not a suspicious reason for believing that will we see is he enchanted more
the officer turned room and said well how goes a good man
sancho got up with pain enough in his bones and went after the incubus in the dark in meeting the officer who was looking to see what have become of his enemy he said to him senor whoever you are do us to favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary oil salt and white for it is water to care one of our best nights errand on earth who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted more than is in this in
to be breathe he took the matures of which he made a compound mixing them on boiling them a good while it until it seemed to him they had come to perfection
sancho pons who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous begged him to give him what was let an epi san which was no small quantity
don quixote consented and he taking it with both hands and good faith and with a better will broke to down and drained a very little lesson his master
if your worship knew that returned sancho won't be tide me in all my kindred why did you let me taste him
search your memory and if you find anything of this kind you needed only tell me of it and i provis you by the order of knighthood which i have received to procure you satisfaction in reparation to the utmost of your desire
then this isn't in said donkey h
in a very respectable one said the innkeeper
the cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his master who appalling to listen attentive to flee was persuaded that some new adventure was coming until he clearly perceived that it was his squire who uttered them
he saw him rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that had his rage aladdin is my belief he would have lacked
sancho took it and as he was raising into his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming sancho my son drink not water drinkin on my son for it will kill thee see here i had the blessed balsam and he held a pascal liquor and with drinking two drops what thou wilt certainly be restored
the strides of a lain man like the ogling glances of a one eyed man they do not reach their goal very promptly
cosette had waked up
jean valjean had paced her near the fire
you will wait for me at a lady's house i shall come to fetch ye
everything is ranged and nothing is said fauchelevent
i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
that's where the difficulty lies
it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out
and she will hold her tell me i answer for that
th yvonne grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean
you understand father madeline the government one notice it
jean valjean stared him straight to ne i and thought that he was raving
fauchelevent went on
it is to morrow that i am to bring you in the priors expects you
then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community
that the nun who had dined that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the fault under the altar of the chapel
that the priors and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil wish of the deceased
that he fauchelevent was to nail up the coffin in the cell raised the stone in the chapel and blower the corpse into the vault
and then that there was another the empty coffin
what is that empty coffin
asked jean valjean fauchelevent replied
what coffin what administration
fauchelevent who was seated sprang up as though almah had burst under his chair you
you know for cheerful what you have said mother crease a fixt is dead
and i add and father madeline is buried r
you are not like other men sat the madeline
this offers the means but give me some information in the first place
how long is the coffin sixth feet
it is a chamber on the ground floor has a grated windows open on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shatter and two doors one leeds into the convent the other into the church a w church
the church in the street of the church which anyone can enter
have you the kings to those toodles
no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the cheat
only to allow the undertakers men to enter when they come to get the coffin
who nails at the coffin i d
who spreads the poor labor it
not another man except the police doctor can enter the deed room that is even written on wall
could you hide me in that ring tonight when everyone is asleep
about three o'clock in the afternoon
i shall be hungry oh i will bring you something
you can come and now the up in the coffin at two o'clock
fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger joints but that is impossible
bah impossible to take a hammer and drives nails in a pan
jean valjean had been worse straight the ms
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to it crises his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean's gloomy talents
you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nay on the top plank on loosely good and what if you should happen to car for to sneeze
a man who is making his escape does not cough all sneeze
who is there who is not said to a cat do come in
the over prudent cats as they are and because they are cans sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
but jean valjean's calmer prevailed over him in spite of himself he grumbled
if you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right i am sure of getting out of the grave
an ulv o'er the old school the grey digger puts the corpses in the grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
i shall follow that is my business
there's holts the undertake his men not a rope around your coffin firm lower y dam
the priests as the payers nates the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
one of two things will happen he will either be sob but or he will not be sober
that is settled father fauchelevent all will go well
on the fallen day as the sun was declining the very rare passers by on the boulevard di men hulled off their hats to an old fashioned hearse ornamented with skulls glass bons and tears
this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a hinge corpse with drooping arms
a morning coach in which could be seen a priest in his circles and a quiet boy in his red cap followed
behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer limped along
the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at might in winter in this cemetery they was subjected to a special discipline
these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalid
dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it
the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the rohan it hinted at poverty pilches if fe peas
to be buried in par is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognized as elegant
the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the introduction of jean valjean into the dead room all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch let us rob in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venal offence insight
it is one of the faults which resent on a duty
the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences
in the cloister what is called the government is only an intermeddling with authority an interference which is always questionable
make as many nos as you please men but keep them for yourselves
a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind
jean valjean's composure was one of those powerful tranquillises which are contagious
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
he played with father mist m
he did what he necked with him he made him dance according to his wind
the permission for interment must be exhibited
he was a sort of laboring map who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm
the man replied the grey digger
the gave dinner yes
you i
father mis genes the brave digger he was
flushing of what had expected anything but this that a grave digger could die
it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do die themselves
he had hardly the strength to stammer
but he persisted feebly farther mie is the grave digger
do you know who little fatherland lynites he isn't job of red wine
but you are a jolly pura
are you not comrade we'll gun have a drink together present
the man replied
he limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity
the grave digger walked on in front of him
fauchelevent passed the unexpected crab once more in review
fauchelevent who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
the sir father nest tiens dead
the man replied completely
the good god consulted his notebook which shows when the time is up it was farthermost un's turn form mist ian died
stammered fauchelevent it is made
you are peasant i am the parisian
fresh w thought i am lost
there were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small ary leading to the nun's corner
and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well
fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter reins clog at the wheels and retarded its speed
my father was a porter at the britonum tim hon
but he had reverses he had losses unchanged i was obliged to renounce the profession of author but i ams still a public writer
so you are not a grave digger then
returned fauchelevent clutching this branch feeble as it was
here a remark becomes necessary
a fauchelevent was up his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
the great digger went on with a superior smile
one must eat
the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake
yes but if i should already ask for something what
well do it for me for i swear to you thou don't love you as the others have loved you
there are bolts in the door wretch
i don't know how it is but it's cas to nance if i do
thou go i can't keep my eyes open
it seems to me as if this sweeping city belongs to me i searched my memory for the names of those whose happiness i had once envied and i could not recall one without finding myself the happier
education fly feeling the sense of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sentinels so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first custer of love all the more ardent because they seem so pure
the more girl believes in goodness the more easily will she give way if not to her lover and these to love for be without mistrust she is without force and to would her love is a triumph that can be gained by any young men of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must they find it tempting how surely must be listened to the first voice which comes to tell it secrets through their bars and bless the hand which she is the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil
with them the body has worn out the soul the senses half burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
they loved by profession and not by instincts
when a creature who has all her past to report herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere irresistible love of which she had never felt herself capable when she has confessed her love how absolutely the man whom she loves dominates her
they know not what proof to give
in order to disturb the laborers in the field was one day devoured by a wolfe because those whom he had so often deceived the longer belief in his cries for help
this is the same with these unhappy woman with the love seriously
but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one drought all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
but to return to the first day of my disan
when i reach home i was in the state of mad gaiety
the woman becomes a man's mistress and loves him
how why
my whole beam was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night
here on my orders tonight at the vote ville
conde the third and trait
the boxes filled one after another
only one remained empty a stage box
at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and marguerite appeared
did she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she lots the happier i should be
what is the matter with you to night said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
he should go to bed she replied with that ironic era which went so well with her delicate and witty face
where at home
you still love me can you ask
because she don't like seeing him
then the less i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and lovely again into the carriage which was willing for them at the door
i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
you in the way marguerite but how
well you might had a woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arriv
during this remark marguerite looked at me attentively
my dear prudence i answered you do not know what you are saying
yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
because i am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm
is that really the only reason
if there were any other i will tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
only you care for me a little a great feel
i fancied for a moment that i might give myself that happiness for six months you would not have it you insisted on knowing the means
well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
i listened and i gazed at marguerite would admiration
when i thought that this marvellous creature whose feet i had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts by part in her life and that i was not yet content with what she gave me i asked if ma's desire had indeed limits when said spied as probably as mine had been it reached after something further
truly she continued we poore creatures of chance have fantastic desire and inconceivable loves
we are not allowed to have hearts and the penalty of being hooded down and of ruining our credit
we no longer belong to ourselves
who stand first in their self stained last in their steam
never did he give you advice which is not lucrative
it means little anden to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they get dresses or a bracelet out of them and that they can drive and o para from time to time or come to our box at the
such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and old aids neither protects nor consols
i thought i could set the life which he offered me but what would you have
what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
marguerite hired out with its long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough pull up her the chief to her lips and from that to her eyes
marguerite do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but in the name of heaven tear up the letter which i wrote to you and d not make me leave you to morrow it would kill me
marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
here it is i have brought back
i tore the letter into fragment and kissed with tears the hand i gave it me
look here prudence do you know what he wants said marguerite
he wants you to forgive him
one has too but he wants more than that what then
i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled
o mister buzzard grinned
this sounded like another story
he was curious about that black headed cousin of all mister buzzard very curious indeed
anyway he would find out
please mister fellar please tell us the story he begged
now all mister buzzard is naturally good natured and accommodating and when peter baggsed so hard he just couldn't find it in his heart to refuse
way back in the days when grandpa buzzard had his low falling out with old king eagle and done fly so high he scorched the feathers often his head he had a cousin did grum pop buzzard and this cousin was just naturally lazy and no couch
like most no count people he used to make a regular nuisance of herself poking his nose into everybody's business and never tending to his own
wasn't anything going on that's this trifling member of the buzzard family didn't find out about a meadow it he could ask more questions than pet rabbit can and anybody that can do that has got to ask a lot
everybody looked at peter and laughed
so we uns stead on the chimney toms whenever old jack fs gets to strain down where he had no business
one day this no count's trifling cousin of gand pup buzzard get cold in his feet
it was on the lower old house a little old tumble down house
why he just stretch his fore head as far down the chine as he can and listen and lessen
but he don't mind that
won't you all please speak a little louder he hollered out the chimney just like that
yes sah she show he was plump scared
they liked to choke that no composer to death
when he get home he tri try to brush the suit off but it done get into the skin and it stay there
a little sigh of satisfaction went round the circle of listeners
it was just as good as one of grandfather frogs
drawer wee fill mix give it me without water
so my friend so whip me off this glass neatly bring me heather some claret a full weeping glass till it run over
a cessation and truce with thirst
you have cast a cold grammer naive forsooth sir
by the belly of think buff let us talk of our drink i never drink but at my hours like the pope's mule
which was first those to drinking

if i drink not i me ground dry gravelled and spent i am start dead without drink and my soul ready to fly into some marsh amongst frogs the soul never dwells in a dry please drouth kill it that
he drinks in vain that fills not the pleasure of it
it is enough to break both birds and petal
what difference is there between the bottle and a flagon
gravely and well played upon the words
our fathers drank lustily and emptied their cans

forthwith the grinning juster began shrieking with laughter said that the bells upon his motley cap were all set a jangling
i did but laugh to think the sword of elite had been so quickly fouled responded the jester and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailor's girdle
one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes
thou shalt have thy liberty he cried even though thou shouldst run me in pieces the moment thou art free
it had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful fairy with filmy wings which shone like rainbows in the moonlight
at this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten
scissors grow a giant's height and save us wh the ogre's might
he could see the ogre standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the chasm and gnashing his teeth each one of which was as big as a mill still
the sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him
thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this dismal spot while i have the power to help thee
he lifted the scissors and with one stroke to strode the web and gave the flies read e
a faint glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole
the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors
as he uttered the words the scissors leaped out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shutters as easily as through it cheese
in a very short time the prince had crawled to the opening

to stand between two religions from one of which you have not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to that like souls

the half lights of doubted him
whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
his discomfort was augment by all the reflections which occurred to him
in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
they soon elbowed him abruptly
request co fer to come and talk with me said marius
what is to become of you said cur fac
what are you going to do i do not know
silver gold here it is
you will then have only a pair of trousers a waistcoat a hat and a coat and by boots

that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sous very slowly
one morning on his return from the lo school marries found a letter from his aunt and a sixty pistol that is to say six hundred francs in gold in a sealed box
marius sent back the thirty louis to aunt with the respectable letter in which he stated that he had suspicious means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs
at that moment he had three francs left
he perceived that it was no good talking to the old men and that the principal person in the house was the mother
before her he decides as cater his pearls
the princess was distracted and did d know what to do she felt she had sent against k
well locker decide our fate said the princess tell me everything
he there hope she meant to say but her looks quivered and she could not out of the question well doctor
as he ried the princess went out of the sigh
the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of is observations
and there are indications mount tristan nervous excitability and so on
the question sends thus in presence of indications of tiber of this process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
yes set an understood thing responded the celery physician again glancing in his watch
beg pardon is the yees kippage dana or shall have the drover
he asked ah it is
oh well then i can do it in twenty minutes
and how about it to her abroad asked the count doctor
what is wanted as the mean of improving nutrition enough lowing
the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
but in favor foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling apis
and then the mother wishes it he said
ah well not paste to be sure let and go only those dron quacks are mischievous
oh times up already and he went to the door
the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so that he ought to seat ovation once more
oh no only a few didius princess come this way
and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing room to gid
when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tars
she answered in and all at once got up furious
excuse me doctor but there is really no logic in this
this is the third time you've asked me the same thing
the celebrated doctor did not take offence
nervous irritability he said to the princess when she had left the room however i had finished
and the doctor began sign thei victor explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certainly harmless
at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged ino deep meditation as though resolving a weighty brabble
finally his decision was bounced they were to go abroad but to put no fate in foreign quacks and to apply to him in any need
it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had young
the mother was much more cheerful as she went back to her daughter and kitty pretend to be more cheerful
educated people of the upper plus are trying to stifle ever brewing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social war
this is absolutely int direct
in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the enters of the group
the champions of the social conception of life usually trying to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires
the basis of authority is bodily wiles
the possibility of applying bodily violence the people is provided above all by an organisation of armed men trained to act in unison and submission to one will
these bands of armed men said missa to a single will are accosted the army
the army has always been and still is the basis of power
power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything can court popularity of the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
indeed it could not be otherwise
only under those conditions c the social organization be justified
but since this is not the case and on the contrary men and power always far from being sans through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
even if there was on a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition amen of violence the existence of authority to restrain such balance was an advantage because the violence of the government was less than the violence of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
between the members of one state subject to a single authority the stripe between the individual seems still less and a life of the state seems even more secure
it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle inquest
after conquest the power of the emperors puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
but this justification is never more than temporary
internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression deserted by the authority over the dissentient individuals
governed authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
and therefore the oppression of the oppress always goes on growing after the furthest women beyond which it cannot go about killing the goose with the gold nights
the most convincing example this is be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest
so it is always been
footnotes the fact that in america the abuses of authority exists in spite of a small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position de positively confirms with
the upper class know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer belong on incense men they feel that this purity of their position depends on the increased drink of the army
the reason to which he gave expressions essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the pops engaged swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of the day so carefully distribute the remits so that the regiments from the frontier there stationed in central districts and the regiments from the centre are stationed on the frontiers
the meaning of creevy speech put into plain language is that funds are needed not to resist foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the slave toiling masses
and this abnormal order of thanks is maintained by the army
but there is not only one goverment there other governments exporting their such as by violent and the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its in slave subjects
and so every government needs an army also to protect its body from its neighbor brigands
this increases contagious as montesquieu pointed abjured fifty years ago
every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defence against its subjects becomes a sort of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
the despotism of the government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the egress ness of a government increases with its internal despotism
the rivalry of the european states and constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse the universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers who obtained at the least possible express
and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practised upon them all citizens have become their own oppressors
this inconsistency has become obvious and universal third service
in fact the whole significant of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitory of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life the groups of persons
but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had meant to avoid
but instead of doing that they expose the individual to the same necessity of strife substituting strike with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors
the taxes raise from the people for war preparations absorb the gravest part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
the danger of war ever ready to break out winners all reforms of la social like vain and fruitless
but the feat significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in social conception of life is not only apparent in that
governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defence but that is not true
there needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an accomplice in all that acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
and for the sake of what are making them
i am expected for the sake of estates to make the sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
except for the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number that that can only be done by change of en varmint and moral influence
so that the justification of stained violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil suppose persons even if it had some foundation three of four centuries ago has none whatever now
except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education cultural means a punic so on
without the state men would not have been able to form a social institutions needed for doing anything
this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in forming societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
without governments nations were be slay by their neighbours
the government they tell us with its army is necessary defenders from neighboring states who might en slab us
and if defence against barbarous nations is meant one thousand part of the troops now under os would be amply sufficient for that purpose
the power of the state are from being as security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes on the contrary the much greater danger of such attacks
even looking at at practically weighing that is to say all the burdens laid on him by the states no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with a state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantages than to refuse to do so
to resist what need independent thought an effort of which every man is not capable
so much for the advantages and disadvantages of both lines of conduct for a man of the wealthy class and oppressor
for a man of the poor working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages
say you know supper
chris looked from medical plated flash like to a car jack can spark plug
noah it's a jump ban that's jine harris
o kay he said
only why didn't you ask them yourself
mike became uneasy and fished and elastic band out of his pocket made a flink of paper and sent its soaring out an em street

criss and for the first time that day the heavy weight he carried within him lifted and lightened little
think he really means it in pursue
he would have liked to get the jaw for jakie who needed it that somehow the task of facing mister wicker especially now that the light was going and dusk edged into the streets was not what christs intended for ending the afternoon
mike's expression changed at what once to one of triumphs but brisk was only partially encouraged
bet your going after all just turned to him
might withstanding on the corner
ah shocks
chris are it off once more passing a bleak little victory and church perched on the hill of mister work's house
an empty lot cut in into by church lane gave look of isolations of ale shaped brick building it sir mister wicker's both house in place of business
no longer wing torn the back a back door that opened on a water street the space between the house when this scones and av had been made into a neat up along flower garden fenced off with the sidewalk by box shrugs in the white picket fence
a livid yellow stained the arising beyond the factories and lay clouds lowered and tumbled above
the air was growing chill and christ decided to finished the job
all at once he wondered how his mother was and everything in him im pinched and tightened itself
at the foot of the hill reached the house
there were three things that always caught his eye i meant the litter of dusty pieces
auto left the coil of rope in the center the model of a sailing ship in a grain glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of the negro boy and baggy trousers turkish jacket and white turban
but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe at home in bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabelle
he had never seen any would go into mister wicker's shop now he thought of b
how then did he lamp and what did he ever sell
a sudden car horn walking from his dream
the many times even had famine mister workers wind know and poured over the rope the ship and the nubian boyd never gone into mister book's shop
some now alone till someone should answer the bell they looked eagerly yet uneasily around him to
but with one window in the lower in day outside the long narrow shop with sombre
had the handing beams crossed it from one side to the other
mister lookers back being towards the source of light chris can not see his face
the double fans a minute wrinkles breaking from eye que a temple and joining with those over the sheep bones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the dome forehead
little top's of white funds above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarians hair but what drew and held chris's gaze with the old men's eyes
crisp linked and looked again yes they were still there
chris swallowed it is vise came backed to
y is sir he said
i set your sign and i know boy who eats the job
he's a schoolmate him min
jed harris's name is new reeling is the job
i i just wondered if the vise mis to open
when he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humour in his face and something scented an appealing about his eyes
he guessed there must be lively fire from that room beyond
would that fear with jakie gigs getting the job sir
but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mindes why d not see the reflection of the headlights at the cars moving bob around the courier of wall utter street nut hill towards the leach signals
the room seemed overly still
then in that second de turn and faced about
the wide bow win it was there before him and three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that tore it in from across of water
gris the water was a free way
it was no longer there over the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen to
the warehouses were still there
flabbergasted and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer appear out the window in every direction
no electric signs no lapt streets
when the people's drove store and stood but half an hour before rose the ruse of what was evidently an in
a courtyard is firstly met by flaring torture too shilling the swinging sign hung on the post
the posts planted at the edge of it was now broad in money row
the coach with had stopped piled high with lugged stamp to a halt beside the flair card
they moved it to the end the coach rattled off to the stable
my window has a pow for those few who are to see
the learning of magic was by means easy
he told his master at once about simon gosling his hoard of money his hiding places for it
chris therefore threw himself and of all the primaries in his task
one afternoon when he had returned after arrest to mister wicker's studying he saw that there was something new in the room a ball with a gold fish in it stood on the table but mister wicker was not to be seen
what should allan do first
how you improve my boy he exclaimed it is not time for you to try missis is gut a change any
suppose i changed and kat changed back
mister worker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for chris to get up his courage
that has nothing happened with a voice like a whip mister rigger said started once
a sensation spread faster and faster
his head swam and he felt faint ne little sick but he persisted through the final words
he thought now without a feeling a pride and commences experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight that some little time elapsed before mister wicker's voice bloom bows by
seventy four book one the return
the figure's shoes carved in some eastern style a curved up pointing toes
that all at once the idea came to chris
if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
he squatted on his haunches examined the carved wooden figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companions
but how did one change inanimate to nen of it
chris got up and stole back to mister wicker's door
he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his broom above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was reeling empty with sir june's proper shape and opened the doors of the cupboard at the far end of the room
the afternoon raining before increased in storm
thus came through hours before its time thunder snarled in the sky
certain elements were be mixed and poured at the proper time
mister worker began moving about upstairs the full boards creaked cranky and still chris could not leave until the face fumed and glowed
with infinite caution chris closed the doors silently behind him in running lightly forward greek the figure at the negro boy
it was as if the stiffness melted
under his eyes wisting folds of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its ruling upon the coat and oh the face
the wind grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of car flowers moved the bouquet fal
they went down to their corners first
guess mister finney went to his quarters i don't remember seeing him cross the decker come over that way at all
next ned silly was reining to the helm by ober jones it took over ned went on down
it looks to me as if it could bitter been one of several people and i'll be switched if i know who well give my eyes open
the mabel was nearing ty
we've water and freres stalls to take o mare
chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin
certainly my boy boomed out the captain as blue eyes abruptly keen and penetrating
mister finney will be some time on deck we cannot be own heard in here
his face rose with nervousness that this might doll do was an answer and he stood stiff and stone before captain blizzard
the captain sat forwards in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say i do
the ship had more to me than wife or mother or family
pause fingering this lower lip the looking sideways in reflective fashion at chris standing before him
we shall say no more but i trust you understand the responsibility you have
a ship its cargo in its men will be in your hands
yes sir i think i can do it safely or i should not try sir
captain blizzard's round pink fac creased in its winning smile
you then went on to describe what else was to father for covering in the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
the cam flush was not a word the captain or anyone else of his time he had understood
what can be said during that time sir chris thought ask
i am somewhat skill in medicaments i have to be as a captain of ship and crew know it
i shall say that you are in my own cabins i can care for you
not since he had left mister wicker and chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
he knew now that his absence for as long as hed to be away would be covered up and satisfaction inly accounted for
their conversation had taken some of a while
when churchyards yon
i knew well enough that he might be carried thousand miles and box car locked in perhaps without water or full
i am sure i guessed lady and i've had terrible moments since when i seemed remember kissing mister jameson too with excitement

livia sleeping sleep of just when i went upstairs and i hunted out my things scaly
they were chucking confidently together but when they came down they seized
there were few preparations to be made the locks to be gone over winters to be instructive as to renewed vigilance and then after extinguishing the hall light we crept in darkness th front door and into the night
i ask no questions
was only somebody spoke and then it was an emphatic be the profanity from bor stuart when he run into a wire fence
i a they know what i expected
the doctor was puffing somewhat where we finally came to a halt
i confess that just at that minute even sunnyside simple cheerful spot
in spite of myself a drum a breath and sharply
it was alex under two long handled spades
the doctor kept a kin lookout but tough one appeared
there's one thing sure i'll not be suspected of complicity

bright and matty with a chins curtains and the little toil had set out not inelegant rely and her pack bi thin gold bench asleep on his perch with a bit of sugar between the wires of agag her pillow sa white and unpressed with its little edging of lace
when he came back to the drawing room a toted bottle of all the gloom in his hand with her lace handkerchief he bathed her temple and forehead
there was nothing very brotherly in his look as he peered into a bale sharp features during the process
there don't mind me she said sharply and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle he had just sat down and went swiftly to her room
and she threw backer vous and going hurriedly to the toilet mechanically survey herself from the glass
wittingly latently what are you know
i stay here that is in the joining room she answered and the face was withdrawn
he slackened a space and tapped sharply at the little window of the madest post office at which the young ladies in the pony carriage had pulled up the day befall and within which look ragged was wonted to sleep in a sort of wooden box that folded of and appeared to be a chest of drawers all day
look took care of mister larkin's dogs and grunted mister wilder's horse and cleaned up his door card for marking close about money and finding that the thing was to be done more cheaply that way put up his horse and dog card in the post of his premises and so evaded the livery charges of the brandon arms
the luke was now there and captain lake recollecting his habits and his haunt hurried on to the silver lion which has its cable towards the common only about a hundred steps away for distances are not great in jings
here were the flow of soul and of stout long pipes long yarns intolerably long credits and the humble of cape races of the town resulted thither for the pleasures of a club life and often revelled deep into the small hours of the morning

luke stuck on as greasy wide a week and in a few minutes more the dark cart was chandler out into the lin and the horse harnessed went between the sharps with that wonderful cheerfulness with which they bere to be palled up and the startling circumstances and unseasonable hours

the acts said that in a of difference of opinion there must be about
he went up to the table and striking it with his fingering he shouted loudly a ballad
he was shouting for the very course starchy even of itch had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole partes and duped in o opposition to it the same vindictiveness though in a more seemly fall on the other side
shouts were raised and for a moment all confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for odo a ballad
we shed up blood for our country
the confidence of the monarch with no checking the accounts of the martian he's not of cashier but that's not the points
votes please peace
they expressed the most implacable hatred
levin did not in the least understand what was a matter and he marvelled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the position above flare off should be put to the vote
he forgot as so j ivanovitch explained to him afterwards this sligo that it was necessary for the publick good to get rid of the marshal of the province but to get into the martian it was necessary to have a majority of wards that to get a majority of boards it was necessary to secure feerd right ab that to secure the recognition of flerov rightabout they was decided on the interpretation to be put on the act
but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant a vicious state of excitement
to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the freshmen bar
he particularly like the way one grey wis good waiter who showed us gone for the other younger was and was jeered at by them was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly
levin advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to search ivanovitch with the questions where laiter put it
so's you ivanovitch frowned
that is a matter for each man's own decision he said severely
having put it in he recollected that he oughter have thrust his left hand to and so he trusted though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasted retreat into the background
a hundred and twenty sex for admission ninety eight against
sang on voice of the secretary who could not planned the letter are
then there was a laugh a button and two knots were found in the box
but the old party did not consider themselves conquered
in obliges met cob spoke of the trust and nobleman of the province had placed to him the aped they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service
this expression in the marshal's face was particularly touching to leaven because only the day for he had been at his house about his trusty business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kind hearted fatherly man
if there are men younger and more deserving than i let themselves
and the marshal disappeared through a side door
they were to proceed immediately to the election
two noble gentleman who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of smet pot and a third had been robbed of his uniform
un learning this the new palsy had made haste during the dispute able faroff to send some of their men in his ledge to clothed the stripped gentlemen and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting
lenin did not care to eat and he was not smoking he did not want to join his own friends that a searcher even of itch step on arkadyevitch sviazhsky and the rest because vronsky in an equerries uniform was sterling with them in eager conversation
he went to the windows and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him
he such a blank od
i have told them so but it makes no difference all i think of it
these portions were unmistakably shaking a place where they could talk with about being overhard
shall they go on your excellency find champagne

oh still just the same always are lars the landowner answered with a resigns mine but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be
why what is there to understand
there's no meaning in it at all
then two one must keep of connections
it's a model obligation of a sort
and then to dell tode there's one's own infers
their proprietors of a sot but we are the landowners
that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
and we are laying out a garden climbing one before the house you know and there you have a tree that stood the centuries in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you don't cut down the old fellow to make wh for the flowerbeds but lay out your beds so as to take it wantage the shape
well and hows your land doing
but one's work a storm in for nothing
oh well wo it what would you have
and once more the landowner went on leaning his elbows in the window and chapping on my son i must only has no days for it
so there will be no one to keep it out and yet one dolt
we walked about the fields and the garden no said he step on miss livid even thing's well looked after but your gardens neglected
to mind thinking i'd got down the mary
here you thousands of lines and each would make two good bundles of bark

yes it's job as strange he went on
the landor are chopping under his whip and dashes
why don't we cut down our box for tum
said levin but dingo her thought that i'd struck him
there's a class instincts too of what one ought and ought to do
there's the peasants too i wonder of them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
without a return two as of simple loss
when he came from the bath process visited him again
but hermon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honor of the seventieth birthday of the old sculptor
she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour
so the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition
the banquet was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing deathly and telling her the words of the oracle
he longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescue demeanor might yet be the work of myrtles had again mastered him
the approval as well as a doubts which had arise in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeeded in bringing it into harmony with the facts
then he went directly to the neighbouring palace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered an impossible to give him even a hints of the conspiracy
when hermon entered the residence of the grammaticus in the palace the guests had already assembled
the place by harmon's side which atta had chosen for herself would then be given up to arsenal
true an interesting conversations still had powered to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight and referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyments blindness de bared him
a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and woman to whom no tad bound him save the presence of the same host
creates had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair haired nickel had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing arsenals praises among his professional associates
his son had been the royal dame's first husband and she had deserted him to marry less makes the aged king of thrace
the king's sister the object of his love cried hermon incredulously
we woman are only as old as we look and the leeches entiring woman of this beauty of forty practised odds which give her the appearance of twenty five yet perhaps the king values her intellect more than hips and the wisdom of a hundred serpents is certainly united in this woman's head
the three most trustworthy ones are hear anytus the leech chrysippus in the admirable process
let us hope you will make this three leaved clover the luck promising four leaved one
your uncle too has often with praiseworthy generosity helped arno in many an embarrassment
how long he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the whole city with delight
when he did finally sem anu he fed things which must have wounded you
that is going too far replied hermon
he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arsenal had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in roads
the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and alethea eagerly confirmed the statement
her maar into the parent silence
the ruddier was just beginning to praise arsenal also as a special friend and connoisseur of the sculptures art when crates her mons fellow student asked the blind artist and behind of this beautiful companion while hist metre was placed upon a pedestal which to others as well as himself seemed too high for the size of the statue
yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of square at him
a woman who earns for the regard of all men and makes love a toy easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals
only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and anthea did not wish to lose harmon's regard
how indifferent you look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you was still a genuine creating artist the case was different
those so loud a denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no idols and snana prove
it was nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
not a sound if you value your lives
to offer resistance would have been madness for even harmon perceived by the loud clanking of weapons round them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prison ne of the place of executions
was he to be led to the executioner's block
what pleasure had life to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art
ought he not to greet his sudden end as a boom from the immortals
did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be imagined
whatever might await him he desired go better fate
if he had passed into annihilation he hermon wished to follow him thither an annihilation certainly meant to redemption from pain and misery
but if he were destined to meet his virtus and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not tell them how sure he was a finding a joyful reception there from both
the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was non nemesis no it was a kindly deity
yet it was no illusion that deceived him
again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
sometimes with the touching entreaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philippicus her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
cried harmon and grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and follow the soldier whom the captain detail to guide her into the palace
to morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path
daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philip a silence char with a grave exclamation the order of the king
as soon as the captive artist was alone with a woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forwards incoherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly returned the pressure he could not restrain the desire to class perch his heart
in spite of his deep mal distress he could have shouted aloud in his delighting gratitude
he might now have been permitted to find forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the polisher the following morning still sealed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought not to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impulse he exclaimed you know that i love you
i love you and have loved you always
daphney exclaimed tenderly what more it's needed
but hermon with drooping head murmured to morrow i shall no longer be what i am now
then have he raised her face to his asking so the demeanors the worker myrtles
put a terrible or deal again awaits you
and i fool planed also min could be vexed with you for it
bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it if you consent with the time arrives to become mine conceal impala nothing
so oki is intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day
he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
his heart contracted painfully it is solicitude about his uncle's fate increased when philippicus informed him that the conspirators had been wrested at the banquet and headed by amin tess the rodion chrysippus and process had perished by the executioner's sword at sunrise
besides he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one last word
on the way his heart throbbed almost to burst state
even acne hiss image and what threatened her father and her with him was seated far into the background
he was appearing before his companions only to give truth it's just due
the egyptian o bay and his master crossed the wide space strewn with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the feast of performances even had his eyes retain the power of sight his bud was coursing so widely through his veins that he might perhaps have been enabled to distinguish the statues round him and the thousands of spectators who crowded closely together richly garlanded their cheeks glowing with enthusiasm surrounded the arena hermon
shouted his friend culls and joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk hermon
even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeanour he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed into the suspicion of having become fatal through his art and his nature
honor to myrtles and his art but he trusted the s noble feast oll assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception and a his prayer for recovery
afterwards it was supposed that he was satisfied with a blood of oxen lamps and doves and that in exchange for or in account of the sacrifices this god gave rain sunshine and harvest

is this goot responsible for religious bites for the inquisition for the ton screw and rack and for all the instruments of torture
did this got alone the cruel and vile to destroy the brave and virtuous
did he loot tyrants to shed a blood of patriots
can we conceive of a devil base enough to prefer his vanities to his friends
how can we account for the wild beasts that the war human beings for the fang serpents whose bit is deaths

a childe charmed by the beauty of the flame grasped it it his dimpled hand
the power would that work for righteousness had taught the child a listen
it is a reason
it is insisted by the theologians and by many of the soul called philosophers that this moral sense this sense of duty of obligation was imported and the conscience is an exotic
leave to get infamies drives and nations
they out praised admired and respected
they are regarded as good that is to say as moral
the members who added to the misery of the family the tribe of a nation are considered bad meanders

the puritan believes the bible to be the world of god and this belief has always made those who have it cruel and to wretch it

the queen received the bile kissed it and pledged herself to diligently wit therein
in other words it was just as fiendish just as in famous as the catholics spirit

it follows that nothing has been or can be created that there never h been or can be a creator
it followed that there could not have been any intelligence and in designed back of matter and force

we now knew that our first parents were not foreigners
we now know if we know anything that the universe is natural and that man and women have been naturally produced
we know the parts that life has travelled
we know the footsteps of advance they have been crazed
for thousands of years men and women have been crying to reform the world
why have the reformer same
they depend on the law on luck ajar thy
they live by frill and vials and bequeath their vices to their chien
failure seems to be the train mark of nature why
nature produced without purpose the states without intention and destroys without falls
master world forever remained a victim of ignorant passion
why should men and women have children that they cannot take care of children that are burden and curses why
passion is and always has been death
nor can punish but it can neither reform criminals norse prevent crime

this is the solution of the whole questions

it is far p to be free to leave the faults and barricades of fear to stand erect and faith the future with a smile
there done far said the schoolmaster in a loki to the sweet outward up the trial and mind your eye
the two monsters took off fair shoes and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses
by means of this stratagem they followed so closely that over within the few steps of sarah tom they did not hear them
sarah and her brother having again passed by the tavy fag arrived close to the dilapidated house which was partly in bins and its open cellars formed a kind of gulf along which the street ran in that direction
in an instant the schoolmaster with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized satan with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling you into his hole
no said the old brad grumblingly no not one rain m a shame
tom satan did not lose his presence of mind during this scene rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred
o a to lay a trap to catch us replied the thief
then addressing thomas seton you know the plain of sainte deny
did you see in the carey we had just left for i know you again the man whom the charcoal man came to seek
cried the schoolmaster a thousand francs and i'll kill in
thatch i do not seek his life replaced sarah to the schoolmaster
let's go and meet him
all boy it would pay for looking after

france who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to alba's request but at once accompanied him to the desired spots and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon
my very good friend an excellent neighbour replied the count with a smile you really ac saturate might trifling exertions
my father the comte de morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i am hesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal
i can scarcely credit it
then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity i the present to realised plans that i have long medicated
show me the positive appointment for a particular day an hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude and keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to adopt
so be it then replied the count's and extending his hand tow a calender suspended near the chimneypiece he said to days the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o'clock now promise me to remember this and expect me the twenty first of me at the same hour in the forenoon
i residing my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the farther site of the courtyards and titles separated from the main building
now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket may yourself perfectly easy the hand of your timepiece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself
that the pens when do you leave
for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two
then we shall not meet in paris
i fear i shall not have her hour
well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young man allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey
what is the matter asked albert of france when they had returned to their own apartments you see more than commonly thoughtful
i will confess to you all butt replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment y have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
did you ever mead him previously to coming hither
upon my honour and linton
he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the throttle of the thousand and one night he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof our trace of all these events save the small yor seen in the distant arisen driving under full sail tow
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino an engagements wedge as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled
but said franz the cot can bandits that were among the crew of his vessel
why really the thing seems to meet simple enough
talking of countries replied franz of what countries the counts what is his native thumb whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life a life as marvellous as alone that hath tinctured his succeeding years with sore dark and blooming and misanthropy
certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered
my dear france replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend al that the morcerf is in danger helped me to deliver him
what are his means of existence what is his both place of what country's native
i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from hands of senor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outwards appearance of ease and and concern i did not very particularly care to remain
and this time it must be confessed that contra of the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all an albert's side
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear of viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation
and now my dear franz let us talk of some ding else
then should anything appear to merrit a more minute examination al bet the morcerf would follow up his researches by means of a small gait similar to that close to the concierge store and which merits a particular description
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate
at a quarter to ten avaled entered he composed with a little room named john and who only spoke english all albert's establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count's chaser also
wait then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will ser with her as she wished
very well at half us ten
is the countess hope yet
the valet left the room
good morning this younger morning said albert your punctuality really alarms me
you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past
no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans
yes he has not much to complain of bou is the capital of charles the seven
it is for that reason you seem you so early

that was one comforts with ey she never went from any forms
she stood there looking consciously and whether seriously and mister ransom a smile of exceeding faintness blaye about her lips it was just perceptible enough to light up the native gravity of her face
her voice was no and agreeable a cultivated voice and she extended a slender white hand to her visitor who remarked with some solemnity he felt a certain guild of participation in missus luna's indiscretion that he was intensely happy to make her acquaintance
he oss that miss chance of hiss hands at once called and limp she nearly placed it in his without exerting the smallest pressure

missus lean's familiarity extended even to her sister she remarked to miss chancellor that she looked as if she were got her for a sea voyage
poor ransom announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery g in reality he had never been so bet as at that moment
the women he had hitherto known had been mainly his own soft clime and it was not often exhibited the tendency he dejected and curs deplor'd in missus lows sister
munson was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very provincial
he was sorry for her but his sorry in a flash that no one could help her that was what made her pack
she could not defend herself against a rich admiration a kind of tenderness of envy of anyone who had been so happy as to have that opportunity
his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruelty dictates
the state of mississippi singed to him the state of despair so he sturbed the remnants of his passy to his mother and sisters and at nearly thirty years age delighted for the first time in new york in the costume of his province with fifty dollars in his puck and an gnawing hunger in his heart
it was in the female line as bales of manson had written in answering her letter with a good dill form and flourish his spoke as if they had been royal houses
if it had been possible to send missus ransom money or even clots she would have liked that but she had moans of asserting her such an luff ring would be taken

she was perfectly safe after writing to bis o lance and indeed it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thanked her he was only exceptionally superlative for her letter and assure her that he would come and see her the first time this business he was beginning to gether it all should take him to boston
he was too simple two mississippian for that she was almost disappointed
of all things in the world contention was most sweet to her the why it is hard to imagine who had always cost her tears headaches a deal too in bad acuter and it was th impossible baser ransom would not care to compend
miss chancet of herself for thou so much or de vital subjects would not she make a few remarks and give them some of her experiences
how did the mate is a began street feel about the ballot
there she could speak for them more there fools and others
with immense sympathy or reform she found herself so often wishing that before is wherein it all different
i have hated dear that finer than you talked out as if it was such a remarkable place and live their wont prefer lovely glory

she knew the place in the boston highway key and was not what missus vallon was supposed so that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been over presented by the aristocracy

it'll be necessary well regent to take co steps to conciliate the shrinking
our movement is all itll be also the most staked ladies
he's the standard am then and bringing your thousand thees

there would be names of willing week insulted persecuted but devoted in e impulse of their being to the cause and asking no better faith than to die for it
it were not clear to this interesting girl in what manner such a sacrifice at this last would be acquired of her though she saw the matter through a kind of sort wise mister l nation which late danger as rosy is success
when this bows i approached it transfigured with familiar h comical sheep and made the poor little h managing hack simple ready a martyr
on if chancellor looked at her would love remembered that she had never in her long in the world and weary life had her thought uninvolved for herself
she had been consumed by the passion of sympathy it had crumbled her into as many creases and all glazed distended glove
but scuse me den you begone during some detecting an given up fishing

and having put himself in a fair way as it hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darcy case colonel ashley went down to police headquarters to learn more facts in the connection with the murder of the east indian
pick usin dona and haven't they carroll yee up
carl was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke girl lazily upwards on the cigars then to say more
are you going to work on that case colonel
but he hadn't any more to do with it colonel been that cat
perhaps not admitted colonel ashley
we've got our man and that's all we want
youre on the darcy case they tell me in away yes
i marking in the interests of the young man
it's just one of them coined int isis like
lusted is head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair
gad explained the colonel
the very pair i was going to buy
look here colonel do you know anything about this
and the detective's professional win stinks got the upper hand of his friendliness not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
i happened to see those candlesticks in the window of single fons shop the other day and i made up my mind to buy them when i had a chance
now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen
thought i don't know whether that's his first or his last name anyhow he had a part or named sheerly
anyhow he infected get long burry while it seems
neighbors often hurt him scraping long and this afternoon they went at it again to hawk and heavy
toward dark a man went into by a lamp
you found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was all e's body with the head busted in in this heavy candlestick near it
sure held so tight we could hard to get it out
maybee the fight was about who ow the watch for the dagoes talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were saying i see
and the watch have you it gle ter
that's the watch announced the headquarters detective reaching in for it going it see
you're not a scream ashes all that are you just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's
and donna's voice was plainly sceptical
yes at they ha some rough edges on it
and i've rad enough about jeremy to know the danger i'd advise you to be careful
if you don't mind i should like to examine this a bit
before the big wind and ireland suggested thong with a nodded d irish compatriot slightly to have the colonel
that's rout agreed the colonel as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
in a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a lead pencil
and donovan take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it
has the surprised detective yes
don't scratch yourself on it whatever you do why not
simply because this watch
somewhat out her to see you
all right meet here in a second
send ah put was the panting answer
i want to talk over darcy's case with you the colonel had said and the two had talked had thought had talked again and now were silent for a time
what are the church of getting him off legally if we go lighted from a negative standpoint asked the colonel
rather a hypothetical question colonel but i should say it might be of fifty fifty proposition
at best he would get off with the scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn't want that nor do i
and you hy a wanted either
but i want to know just where we stand now i know
but i need to do a little more smoking out first now i want to think
if you'll excuse me i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may cat something
in fact i have a feeling that i lend my fish
i'd recommend him to you instead of wa stone thanks lapped kenneth
what is it perhaps i can hop you
the old adage of two head you know
yes it' still holes good
no law mony replied the curl puzzled yes just that
and there's no reason you should know
chuckled the colonel as he skilfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook
and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip in now limp fish into the creole colonel ashe he gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
the reason she asked no alimony inquired kenneth
no i wasn't thinking of that
however don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough for to day
well i don't know that you can
it isn't generally known went on the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him
it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of a baser sort
you don't mean the larch struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did
the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him
aaron grafton statement was being unexpected great confirmed
he remembered that cynthia and grafton had once been in love with each other
she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer
because large made no defence
large by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
so i had to let her have her way and m j i last the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel feet
no but he will or i'll see him and get judgment oh he'll pay all right
and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up
still i would like ton
the murder of missus darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweller was tried
it had a double reputation so to speak
grave and even reverend the conventions assembled in its ball room and politicians of the upper if not better class were frigate seen in its dining room or cafe
large himself was a peculiar character
in a smaller place he would have been called a salon keeper
and it was this man rich over said handsome certainly that cent thea retford had married
to this was the answer whispered money
and in a way was true
she also sided an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges
after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the larch hotel it could hard be called home became the scene of many festive occasions
then it was s of large that soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat his wife with refined cruelty that hidden away from the public underneath his habitual matter there was the wrongness of the brute
but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less often represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smashed or who had not yet acquired any and were rolling to take a chance
it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me in the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be seen there kenneth explained to the colonel
meanwhile colonel ashley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he sawed darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something to be done always returned the answer
don't gary it will come out all right
i'm going to rectify them but it will take time
it's hard for miss mason too although she's bearing up like a major
so king got bail who put it up
it was hy larch
they took harry away while ago
but he is a pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same
only that i darcy hesitated and grew red
good evening colonel he called genially will you join me in a welsh rabbit
thank you no
i'm afraid my dad jess and isn't quite up to that as i've had to cut out my fishing of late
now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder
the stopped clocks for instance have you any theory
there were three of them the center figure being gone of harry king and he was very much intoxicated
that is not always but sometimes it happened to be so now
i beg your pardon he said in the country tones he knew so well how to use yet of which he made so little use of late
i said where have you been remarked together we've missed you
i said i was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort
by polonius someone asked
because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
there was a rattle of coin on the mahogany bar as king sought to disentangle a single bill from the wadded up currency in his pocket
it's it's an odd coin an old roman one that missus darcy had in private collection kept in the jeweler's door safe was the whispered answer
i went over them near of the day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was kilt
that was hers w on the dur
now harry king has it exclaimed colonel slyly
even the sun came out pale and watery at known

then i took up a great stone from among the trees and coming up to him smote him therewith on the head with all my might and crushed in his skull as he lay dead drunk
behold a ship was making for the island through the dashing sea and flashing waves
hearing this i was sore troubled remembering what i had before suffered from the ape kind
upon this he brought me a cotton bag and given it to me said take this bag and fill it with pebbles from the beach and goave forth with a company of the townsfolk to whom i will give a charge respecting thee
do as they do and belike thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land
then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pebbles
to these he committed me commending me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how to gather that he may get his daily bread and you will earn your rewarding recompense in heaven
now sleeping under these trees were many apes which when they saw us rows and fled from us and swarmed up amongst the branches whereupon my companions began to pelt them with what they had in their bags and the apes fell to plucking of the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk
we weighed anchor and shahrazad perceived the dawn of the day and ceased saying o permitted say
when it was the five hundred and fifty ninths night
and ceased not sailing till we arrived safely at bassorah
there i abode a little and then went on to bagdad re entered my quarter and found my house and were gathered with my family and saluted my friends it gave me joy of my safe return and i laid up all my goods and valuables in my storehouses
after which i returned to my old merry way of life and forgot all i had suffered in the great prophet and gain i had made
next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawn prayer and after blessing mohammed the cream of all creatures betook himself to the house of sinbad the seaman and wished him a good day
here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales therein
happily amongst you is one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up and all and everything on board of her were plunged into the sea
but it burneth in their bellies so they cast it up again and it congealed on the surface of the water whereby its color and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it ashore and the travelers and merchants who know it collected and sell it
each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides and after little the rest of my fellows perished one by one till i had buried the last of the party and bode alone on the island with but a little provision left i who was wont to have so much
but there is majesty and there is no might save an allah the glorious the great
when it was the five hundred and sixty first night
then signed for myself i set to work collecting a number of pieces of chinese and corner and aloes wood and i bound them together with ropes from the wreckage then i chose out from the broken up ships straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the ells wood making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel of the stream and i tied it tightly and firmly as though it were nailed
land after land shalt thou see can find but no other life on thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul and thy thoughts a night or woes shall end or sooner or late
i rode my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried with a raft with it down the underground channel
and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft by reason of the narrowness of the channel whilst the stream ceased not to carry me along knowing not night from day for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me about in my terror and concern for myself lest i should perish
when i awoke at last i found myself in the light of heaven and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft moored to an island in the midst of a number of indians and abyssinian
but i was delighted at my escape from the river
when they saw i understood the night and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace be with thee o my brother
o my brother answered he we a husbandman and tillers of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding thee asleep on this raft laid hold of it and made it fast by us against thou shouldest awake at thy leisure
i answered for a lad's sake and my lord ere i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after ask me what thou wilt
when it was the five hundred and sixty second night
she said it hath reached me our auspicious king that sinbad the seaman continued when our landed and found myself amongst the indians and abyssinian and had taken some rest they consulted among themselves and said to one another there is no help for it but we carry him with us and present him to our king that he may acquaint him with his adventures
so i consorted with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respect
so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing to set out with the merchants for that i pined after my people and mine own land
quoth he thou art thine own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us on o head nigh be it for thou gladdest us with thy company
by allah are my lord answered i thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with thy favours and well doings but i weary for a sight of my friends and family and native country
then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchant sappho said
he asked me whence they came and i said to him by allah a commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way thither
for state processions a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant eleven cubits high and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks on his right hand and on his left
his letter hath shown me this and as for the mightiness of his dominion thou hast told us what thou hast dy witnessed
presently my friends came to me in i distributed presents among my family and gave arms and largesse after which i yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment mirth and merrymaking and forgot all but i had suffered
such then are my brothers is the history of what befell me in my sixth voyage and to morrow in shall a
i will tell you the story of my seventh and last voyage which is still more wondrous and marvellous than that of the first six
when it was the five hundred and sixty third night
she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sindbad the seamen had related the history of what befell him in his sixth voyage and all the company had dispersed sindbad the landsmen went home and slept as of wont
the seventh voyage of sinbad the seaman
no o company that after my return from my sixth voyage which brought me abundant profit i resumed my former life and all possible joyance and enjoyment and mirth and making merry day and night and i tarried some time in this solace and satisfaction till my soul began once more to long to sail the seas and see foreign countries and company with merchants and hear new things
so having made up my mind are packed up in bales quantity of precious stuffs suited for sea trade and repaired with them from baghdad city to bassorah town where i found a ship ready for sea and in her a company of considerable merchants
but the captain arose and tightening in his girdle tucked up his skirts and after taking refuge with uh from satan the stoned climbed to the masthead whence he looked out right and left and gazing at the passengers and crew fou to buffeted in his face and plucking out his beard
this he set in a saucer wetted with a little water and after waiting a short time smelt and tasted it and then he took out of the chest a booklet wherein he read awhile and said weeping no are ye passengers that in this book is a marvellous matter do noting that whoso come tit that shall surely die without hope of escape for the dis ocean is called the sea of the clime of the king wherein is a sepulchre of our lords solomon son of david on both be peace
a second fish wad its appearance and which we had seen nought more monstrous
when suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship which rose out of the water settled upon the great reef the haunts of sea monsters where it broke up and fell asunder into planks and all and everything on board were plunged into the sea

virtually could not possibly find that the prisoner had not deliberately an intentionally blown up the albert hall the question was could they find any extenuating circumstances which would permit of an acquittal
of course any sentence which the law might feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an image at pardon but it was highly desirable from the governments pint of view that the necessity for such an exercise of clemency should not arise
a headlong pardon and the eve of a bi election with threats of a heavy voting defection if it were withheld or even delay would not necessarily be a surrender but it would look like one
hence the anxiety in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in whitehall and dawning street and others affected centres

it was missus peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there are thieves in the house we keep the drawing room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while we are at breakfast
she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not being stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later bearing a cream jug in her hands
the pigeon coats had turned paler than ever missus peter had a final inspiration
peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lived so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed within measurable distance
missus peter turned to her guest with confidential kindness
peter is little weakness a turns in the family good nord
do you mean the sa is a clapt the meaning like cousin's natur
fay little woman said better rid a gasp of relief i could never have den it
and from the carrying off the coast

that my father is sir risdon graham smuggled goods here
he could not help it he hate the smugglers you shall not tell
pretty pray say you will not ach you a some
then as archie stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he heard the faint rustling once more and again all was simon
he laughed but it was a curious kind of laughs full vexation engineer ah proper as the prince caller a love of our own dignity of which archibald gray stroke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british officer had a pretty good stock
and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
cold wooer came on this idea directly as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner and the power of a very reckless sit of people who would stop at nothing
no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would knock me about
the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could
to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest points signal for help milo boat's crew roy surging for him how to escape
the window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them o solidly fitted into the stone sill
next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched in old fashioned marble mantelpiece fireplace chimney
yes if other rays failed he could escape up the chimney
no that was too bad he cannot do that
sympathy and pity for the dwellers and the hose were completely gone now and he said his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people
a narrow table against the wall in two places
he went and tried to force his head through recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the bother would pass
but there was no chance for his body there that had would not go first
a fellow who was shut up and prisoned for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
sure you look ground everywhere boy yes father quite
i'm going on the burgess
shall i come do feather no
stop here till sir risdon ter down until him hong very sorry that we should have cleared our last night only a born fool saw jerry andy's lobster boat coming into the cove and came running to say it was a party from the cutter yes father
tell him not to be uneasy tis all right and i'll have a rein clear away to nay
the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin or archy race stroke lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down my sleep
what a queer dream he felt to himself
and how queer for mister gurr to be talking like that to andrey teal the boy who helped the cook
and why did andy call mister gurr father
there was an interval of thinking over this mie question during which the low whistling went on
and i'm whom you too tell i was up i suppose
no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint missed hung like reeds of smoke
what did they say false alarm tell servant and they would clear all away to night see if anything had been left about lobster wrote
once out of that room he could ram and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunt him down
oh those bars he meant they exclaimed and he was advancing towards them just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of bootes against stone work and ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young machan instead
ran was the first to recover from his surprise
blow he said hurl
go round and opened the door i was should in last night by mistake
i saw you last night in wanted was boy he was
it was your father kick for shirking and my well i hardly know you
nonsense
won't do said remembering
think i don't know you mister officer
won't do said run quickly i know you
been flying the spire to a h renewing who locked you in
archie stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
he has gone to give the alarms about the prisoner and he looked excitedly round for away of escape
nothing but the chimney presented itself
a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curved dirk glanced at the edge ran to the window and began to cut it one of the bars labor in vain
he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks in grating sounds as he realized that the attempt was madness
the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear selling sound as he found that now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the dirk into its sheath
no we can't part with that ha hah laughed the boy jeeringly
fell yes i'll give you a guinea if he will let me out
guinea said the boy think i'll do it for guinea weld them too
be quick there's a good fi i want to get away at once
shot you only a sham
why your clothes don't fit you when your caps put on all spur
never mind about that let me out of this place
i told you a fisher boy cried arch impatiently but trying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
not you looked like a wild beast in a cage make a monkey you insolent
archie checked himself and the boy laughed
it was your turn yesterday it's min to day what a game
you laughed and fleered at me when i was on the cutter's deck
i say you do what lake lemon just like a big mogi and show
ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long low fit of laughter
you rope send me he said
why i could tie you up in a knot and heave you or f theft any day what a game
bit of a made he fed on a salt tack and moodily biscuit talk of giving me ropes and
once more will you come and let me out no
to his astonishment the board did not flinch but thrust his own arms th replacing him about the mie's waist clenching his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle

jes hallen who's hard wor store near try to go into the bank but miller ordered him away and you ran around the corner shouting
get your gon boys they're robbing the bank
and i called to him to get inside at the same time firing a pistol shout in the air as the signals of the three boys at the bridge that we had been discovered
almost at this instant i heard a pistol shot in the bank
shadwell woods and jim rode up and joiners shouting to the people in the street to get inside and firing their pistols to emphasize their commands
if any of our party shot him it must have been woods
meantime the street was getting uncomfortably hot
every time i saw any one with a beat on me i would drop off my horse and try to drive the sheet or inside but i could not see in every direction
doctor wheeler who had gone upstairs in the hotel shot miller and he lay dying in the street

sheriff g lisping of water one county who was taking bob's pistol from him was also shouting to the fellow
including those received in and on the way from nor field i have eleven wounds
in chef lisp in's order not to sheet was the beginning of the protector that minnesota people established over us
captain murdock
but mars port had flourished enough to kill it off
some of mar's laws dated from the time when lawn force ment had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
the stone wall gang numbered perhaps five hundred
even der alex and failures had to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which eat out some kind of a marginal living
they were safe from protection rakers there none bothered to come so far out
the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
captain murdock was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
the pressure was enough to get them for him
gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
i've got a free hand and we're going to run this the way we would on earth
your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
the first man making a shake down we'll get the same treatment we going to use on the stone wall boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
he picked out five of the men include in gordon you five will come with me
the rest of you can team up any way you want tonight pick any route at open th came in lust go
bruce gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick and murdock's eyes fell on him earth cop
two years gordon admitted
for a second gordon cursed himself
he began wondering about security then
nobody had tried to get in touch with him
there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim poser bulb glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
moving in two groups of threes at opposite sides of the street they began their beat
there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from whack of air
gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands
corn's eyes popped at that
he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
the other four cops had come in reluctantly
he brought him to the ground with a single blow cross the kidneys
they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cup started off
to find a throne and call the wagon
were not using wagons murdock told him lying them up
if they tried to run they were hit from behind y they stood still they were clubbed carefully
murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulders shaking in tears running down his cheeks
the captain's face was as sick as gordons felt
i want the name of every man and the gang ye can remember he told the man
colonel they kill me i don't know
murdock took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tufts
if he should turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
trouble began brewing shortly after though
murdock sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of sixth and then a third
and the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men had been beaten before
get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he word
but the captain stirred finally sighing
now the cop ner giving me we covered gordon
but the stonewall ganged is backing wain
but it's going to be tough on them
breech gordon grimaced i've got a yellow ticket from security
murdock blinked he dropped his eyes slowly
what makes you think wain will be reelected
nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
ever see a martian election
no you're firste he can't lose
and then hell is going to pop and this whole planet may be blown wide open
it fitted with the dia predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner
cost a more but they be respectable
because is he is always honestest according to have he sees it
but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
the groups grew more experienced and murdock was training a new squad every night
it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
this could lead to abuses as he'd seen on earth
but there probably wouldn't be time for if mayor wane was reelected
it was night outside and the pops bobs at the corners glowed dim ling giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporised precincts
it had probably been year since any had dared risk it after the sun went down
and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that haile system was working
gordon hit the signal switch and the march speaker let out a shrill whistle
gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
you can't do it to me
i'm reformed i'm going straight
y damned cops cent oa was blubbering
one look was enough the work papers had the tell tale over thickening of the signature they had showed up on other papers obviously forgeries
some turned away as gordon and the other cup went to work but most of them warn't squeamish
when it was over the two picked up their whimpering captive
chickens the other cup had been holding the wallet
must have been making a big contact in something fifty fifty
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
when gordon and jenkins came back murdock tossed the money to them split it
whatever comes to han governor
like this social call a gordon asked him
the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober no
you are me some bells governor
eleven hundred fifty credits
you didn't pay up your pledge to the captain fund so i had a fill in
a thousand interest at ten per cent a week standard right
gordon had heard of the friendly interest charge on the side here but he shook his head wrong is he
hah is he turned it over and shook his head
now show me where i signed any agreement saying i'd pay you back
first second izzie's face went blank then he chuckled
he poured out the bills and handed them over
thanks his he thanks yourself
the kid pocketed the money cheerfully noding
the little guy new mars as few others did apparently from all sides
and if any of the other cups had private racquets of their own izzie was undoubtedly the man to find it out and used the information with the beat such as that even going halves and withal the graft to the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped into the bench
go on except damon
there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
the little publishers was back at the crusader again
only gordon and she lo were left
credit had been established again and the businesses were open
gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwellings built like the dome but opaque for privacy
they have been lucky
school bird's volunteers were official now
fate's place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
he reached automatically for the class of ether needle beer
thought ye'd be in the chips
that's mars gord knacker other's comment why don't you pull off the planet fats you could go back to earth i'd guess father nodded
guess man gets used to anything hell maybe i can hi some bumps to sit around and whoop it up when the ships come in and bill this is a real old martian den of sin
there was a grin on the other's face
finally got our orders for you it's mercury
we sent to ty others a same way and they failed
let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
you can't stay here
there's a rocket waiting to tranship you to the man on the way to mercury right now gordon sighed
and i paid her the pay we owe you from the time you begin using your badge she's up shopping
but his old eyes were glinting
did you think we'd let you go without seeing off cobb are he asked
i i oh dread it i'm getting old i he you tell him
he grabbed gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank izzie shook his head
any colchester had begun to make prince with leslie
leslie determined to triple up us in english language and literature

leslie win to the window and flung it open she put her head out and tried to pear into the darkness but the moon had already said and she could not see more than a couple of yards in front of her
she is a fury queer the rated creature and at litter there was bad news in their litter
what can't you doing out by herself
via lit the room but she had scarcely gone a dozen places downed the corridor before she met any returning

she did not take the least notice of basing but going into the room shut the door

she turned off the light and letter candle which she put be hider screen then prepared to get and beard
emmy's manner was very mysterious
annie did not mean to confine than anyone that night and the kindest thing was to leap her alone
tie it out listen yourself propped asleep
annie is that you she called out
there was no reply but the sound of prying steps came quicker and quicker now and then there interrupted by a groan
oh this will kill me my heartful break this will kill me
