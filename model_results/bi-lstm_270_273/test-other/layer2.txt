margaret said mister hale as he returned from shone his ges downstairs i cannot hel watching no face with some anxiety when mister thornton made his confession of having been shopp boy
you don't mean that you thoughted me so silly
i rely like that account of himself but to than anything else he said
he statement of having been a shop boy was a thin i like best the w
you who were always accusing people have been sholy at helstone
i don nothing mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us that telling us what he had been
a really was very much afraid of showing him how much sho i was that some part of what he said
his father tinging miserable circumstances
why it might have been in the work house
his father speculated wildly failed and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace
all his former friends sharp from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to gain his own moderate portion of worth
no one came fords to helped the mothers and this boy
at least no friend came forwards mutely and mister thornton is not one i fancy to wait to ti kindness comes to find her out
so they lef milton
how tainted asked her father
op par but that testing everything by the standard a worth
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked up them only as news of extending trade and making money
and the poor m around him no poor because they were vicious out of the pale of be sympathies because they had nots iron nature and the capabilities that it gives him from for being rich
not vicious he never said that
in provident self indulgent wor his words
margaret was collecting him others working materials and preparing to god to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please ovver but which to be full and true must included little and moans
however out it came
pap i do thinks the thornton a veryain remarkable men but pursy i dont like him at all
i do said her father laughing
first me as he call it and all
i didn't sit him up for a ho or anything of that kind
but good my child
there was several other signs of something run about missus hale
she in dixon held ms dears consultations in a bedroom from which dixon would come out crying in cross as a custom when any distress of her mistress called up upon her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chambers soon after dixon lifted and found her mother on her knees and his margaret's out she ca a few words which were event a payer for strengthned patience to indue se of v bodily suffering
but though she received presses and for words back again in such profusion as would have glad in her formerly yet she felt but there was a secret with held from her and she believed it bore serious reference to mother's health
she law very long this night planning how to listen the evil influence with the milton life on her mothers
a servant to give dixon per minute assistance should begot if she gave up the whole tim to of the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attention she required and had been accustomed to whole lifely
visiting register offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and veryain the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she m busy h cans in the street and stopped to speak to her
well busy howe you
be her and not better if you know what that means
not exactly replied margaret smiling
i be her not being torn to pieces by coffin the nights but dram we and tired a milton and longing to get away to the lena ber and when i think i father and further off a heart sinks none no better i wor
margaret turned round to w gol side of the girl in her fable progress homeward
afore a minute two she did not speak
at last shes said in a low voice
bessy do you wish to die
bessy was silent in her turned for a minute two then she replied

the feverish col came into a cheeks and the feverish blame into e
but you be there father he shall o the heart
she put herr to it and became gusty pale
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to d reis upon her bosom
prison with the spasm that four shadowed death had passed away and busy roused herself and said
i'll gos to bed it's best place but catching that margaret's gan you'll come again i know you will but just say it

he who will recited the first time hath the decide the second dine and i heard him hard by
by allah and thou f she not to me i will should le roused the chamberlain on thee and he shall be the and cast the yard
but take these hundred denis and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no het
returned queenly and leaner not
when it was was the seventy third nine
but theo said i will not leave thee gil thou show me who it was that reciting the verses for i drag returning into my lady with h him
now when the fireman heard these words he feared fs on mc and wept with a exceeding weeping and said to the uno by allah it was not i and they know him not

then he cas the oo's head and spake he fair tal he went away but the co strato fetched the around and returning his secretly came and stood behind the firemen fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
i say what made my eeny what have the beater carp drain far beef from me th land tole not re lay bow those who blame and for such lo would deal me shame
then said the uno to z hour mack beast be would be o my lord

then she threw herself upon him and he gat on her to his bosom and thew fell downed in a fainting fet
when the uno so these case he wander that them and throwing over then somewhat to covered them waited till they should recover her
afterwhile they came to themselves ands oz am rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression laughed to and gladness took the mastery of hert and she repeated these verses
accordingly she told him all that had come to her seems the expiation at the c and what had happened to her with the but ay how de merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her broader sh and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of by how he had mead at marriage contract with her and had gone e too heard and how the king they have sire had sent and asked fort her from from shark
but now go too thy master and breaking quickly to me
the chamber let called astral and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the talker del he found him in thea of the cat girding hes ass and prevailing for flight
she said ith reached me or specious king that when talker girths us forli and bespake himself singing o would i knew what is become of him
i believe he hath denounced me to the uno hence these pages at about me and he h made me in ac couples it is crim

and amongst them were some who would have chosen the ca z mac for quoth they his named blight of the place and he hath a sister news as am hies the delight of the time but they sat out fight years ago for all he jars and none wets what is become of them
so he turned to the w was of u d and said to him badly your tail is a wonderland

cosette had waked up
jean valjean had paced her near the five
you were will wait for me at a ladys house i shall come to fetch
everything is ranged in nothing is so for sheaf
i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be gott out
thats where the difficulty alice
it is easy enough with the childs you will carry her out
and she will hold her tum me i answered for that
for she of grumbled more himself th to jal vase
you understand father mine the government will nots it
ja val stead him straight ne i and thought that he was raving
fo shea all went
it is to morrow the time to bring you the porous expects you
then he explained toed jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he f leval was to render to the community
that the nun who had dined that morning had requested to be buried and the coffin which had served her for a bed and t in the fault under the altar of the chapel
that the priors and the vico mothers intended to foo fill wish of the deceased
that he for ah leval was to nil up the coffin in the c raised b stone in the chapel and lower the corpse into the volt
and then that there was an the empty coffin
wes that e ty coffin

what coffin wat administrations
for shea all who was seated sprang up i were b had burst under his chair you you
you know for sal what you have said mot the crease affection is dead
and i a and father mine is buried a
you are not by other men saw the midland
this offers the means give me some informations in the first pace
how long is the coffin six feet
it is a chamber on the ground thor has a grated windowy opened on the garden which is closed on the outside by shutter and two doors one needs into the convent the other into the church or what church
the church in the street that the church which any one can enter
have he kings to those two doors
and no i have the ky toed the door which communicates with the conrad the porter has the ky to the door which communicates with the chat
only too allow the under is meant enter when they' come to get the coffin
who knows up the coffin id do
who spreads the po leveret
not an mother man except the police doctor can to the dream that is even written on wall
pity hide me and that wing might when ever one is asleep

f live a coiled and packed his fingerings but that is impossible
but impossible to take a hem and drive s nails in the pin
jean valjean had been in was straight the mess
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
to have himself nailed up in a casas and carried off like a bale of goods to li for a long time in a box to find air wither is none to it conmee his breath for allens to know how to stifle without dying this was one of je valjean's bluing tens
we surely must have a gim you will make a few holes hein there around my mouth and you will mow on the top plan pon loosely goods and what if he should happened to c for to sez
a man who is making his escape do not co orses
who is there who was not sent toc cat do you come in
the over prudent cat's as they are and because they cans sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
jal valjean's coolness prevailed o in spite of himselfe grumbled
if you was sure of coming out of the cable o i am sure of getting grave
and old the old school the greater puts the courses in grave and i but the grave der in my pocket
i shall follow it that is my business

the interment of mother crucifixion in the volt under the altar the exit of cosette the instruction of jean valjean into the dead room all have had been executed without difficulty and there hadad been no h lets rem can passing that the burial of mother caser fiction under the altar of the convent is a perfectly vial offense in u sid
it is one of the fs which reed on a gite
the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of therein consciences
in the coaster which is call the government is ugly intimate with authority and interference which is always questionable
make as many nos as he peas m but keep them for yourselves
a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
posta nim along behind the hurst in a veryain contented fame of mind
jean valjean's composure was one of this powerful tranquility which are contagious
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
he played with father missin
he did' hen with him you made him dance according to his wind
the permission for interment must be exhibited it
he was a sort of labouring ma who w waist cut with large pockets and carried matter under his am

the man replied
he limped more out of anxiety and from infirmity
the great digger walk on in fronting

educational fly feelings of duty the family are strong sents but there are are no sense so vent as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first castle of love all the moreen because they seene so purer
the more girl believes in goodness the more is lea will she give wa if not tor lover and vast to love for be without mistrust shee is without force and tow her love a triumph that can begins by any young m of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
then how surely must desire the worlds which is hin from from them hows only must be finds at tempting how surely must be listened to the first voice which comes to tell its secret s th their bars and bless the hands which she is the first to rae a corner of the mist veil
with them the body has worn out the soul the senses half burns up the heart dissipations has blunted the feelings
they loved by professions and not by instinct
when a creature who is all her past to re po herself with it is seen all at once i a profound sincere a risible love of which he she had never felt herself capable when shee has confessed her love how absolutely the man wh she loves needes her
they know not what proof to givee
in od to disturb the laborers in the field was one d devoured by a wolff because those whom he had so often deceived the long of the lef in his cries for help
this is the sam with these unhappy woman with be loved seriously
but when the man who inspires this re deeming love is great enough and soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when his short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one drought all earthly emotions and after such a love his hearts will be closed to every other
but to return too the first day of mel song

my whole beam was exalted to joy at the memory of the words the exchanged during that first night
here on my orders tonight at av val
conde the third and tre
the boxes filled one after another
only one remained empty the stage box
at the beginning of the thirds act i heard a door of the box on which by eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and mug appeared

well you might have had a woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been in amusing for her to see two more arriv
during this remark margaret's looks at me attentively
my dear prudence i answered he did not know what you are saying
yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as as f as my door you will w to come up and as i could not l you i did not wish to lad you go away blaming me prosing no
because i am watched and the least suspicioned might to me a greatest harm

i fancied for a moment th i might give myself their happiness for six months you will not have it you insisted on lying the means
well good heaven's the means were easy enough to guess
i listened and i gazed their a marguerite would admirations
when they thought that this marvelous creature whose feet i had longed to kiss was willing to let me take my pleas in her thoughts by part in her life and that i was not yet contented will was she gave me i asked if m desire had indeed limits when so spi as probably as min had been it reached after something further

educated people of the upper poses are trying tol ever growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social
this is obsol andret
in the social conception of life is supposed since the aim of life is founding groves of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interest for the enters of the group
the sham int of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea authority that is of violence with the idea of moral ince but connections qui impossible
the men who was control by mal influence acts and accords with his own hiss
the basis authorities boy alce
the possibility of applying motley vis the people is provided above all by an organisations of armed men trained to act in unison and submissions to one will
these bands armed men said miss to a single will area cost the army
the army has always been and still is bis power
power is always in the hands of those who control joi an omen per from the romances said to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army then in anything he court popularity of the ary knowing that that is on their side their power secured
indeed it could not be otherwise
only under those conditions could the social organisations be jest to fi
the since this is not the cas and on the contrat men and power al his far from being sins through the very fact of their possession of power the social organizations basted on power has no justifications
even if there was what a time when owing to the lo standards of morals and the disposition of ment violence the existence of author to restrain such louse was an advantage because the viol to the goverment was lesson the vi of individuals when can put see that this advantage c not be lasting
between the members of one state sue to a single authority the tried between the individual seemed still less and a life of the state seems even morcar
it was produced on one hand by the natural gr of the populations and on the other by struggling godless
after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to inter und ascensions and so state conception of live justify himself
but this justifications ever more than t ebery
and te ascensions disappear only in proportioned to that degree of oppression deserted by the authority over the d sin in individuals
govern authority even if it suppressed private violence always introduces into the life of n fresh forms of vil which tenderly come greater and greater and proportion to the duration and strength of the government
and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing af the fest lama beyond what a coke i killing the goose with a gold nice
the most convincing example is be found in the conditions of the working class of our apo who are in reality nobody than the slaves of ancient time se due that conquest
so it is always been
fo nut the fact that in america he wed of a thord exist in spite of a small number of their troops not only fails had his preen position deposited confirms it

the reason too which he gave expressions essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the pops engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the rushing authorities of to days so carefully distribute ther re grips so that the regiments fromage stationed and central districts and the regiments from the centre o stationed on the frontiers
the meaning of the privy speech put into plain languish is it fer needed nurses fore and those but to b under officers to be ready togs the
and this had normal order of thanks is maintain by the army
but theres not only one oven their other governments exploiting their such is by vile in the same way and are always ready to pounds down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its ince late subjects
as so every gan thees an army also to pot its booty from for its nea or brigands
this increases cages as montescue p as obed for the years ago
every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self offs against it subjects the c a sort of danger for neighbor states and calls for similar increase in their armies
the despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army extra successes and the returns of a goverment increases with its internal despotism
the rivalry of the european states and constantly increasing their forces has reduced them int to the necessity of having recourse to the universal mary service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers whose obtained least possible express
and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practiced that upon them all citizens have become their own impress
this inconsistency as become obvious and universal th service
in fact of the hignett the social concession of life consists in mans recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitory as of personal life itself and the trans france of the aim of life the groups of cress
but with universal mal ty service it comes to past that men after making every sacrificed to get it of the cruelty of strife and the in security of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had me to avoid
but in set of doing that they exposed individuals to the same necessity of strife sus tut ex tri with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors
the taxes raised for from the people for war preparations of sor of the grated part of the pros of labor which the army ot defend
the danger of warm ever ready to break out rin is all reforms of life social like vain and fruitless
that the fin sniff ince of universal military service as a men off stationed of the contradiction carn in the sociate con suction of life is not only apparent that
goverment a car g that armies re needed ab all for external offense but that is not sho
there neither principally against their subjects and every man under universal tarry service the comes eccles and all that ace of violence are the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
and for the sake of what a mak them
i expected for the sake of a state to make the sacrifices to renounce everything that kan be precious to man peace family security and you a dignity
excepted the state they say we should be expose to the attacks of evil dispose persons in our on country
we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish the number could that can only be done by change of en arma and mal influence
so thats justifications that stay violence on the grounds of the protection gives from evil sloes persons even if a had some foundations three of or centuries ago has none whatever now
except for the state they cals we should not have any religion educational cure mea punic s
without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything
this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
the great extension of means a communications and interchanged ideas has made men completely able to dispense with stat in fed societies association's corporations and converses for scientific ago and political objects
without governments nations of beens layed by the nabs
the government its with its army is necessary defends from neighbor state wh m slav us
and if defence ast barbarous nations as men one thousand part of the troops now under os would be ale superi with that purpose
the power of d state f from being security again fee tykes of our neighbors exposes on the contrary to much gite danger of such tacks
evened looking at a practically wang that is to say all the birds laid all by the states no man can filed to see that for hem personal to comply with a state de mans and serve the arming would in the majority of cases be more disadvantages than to af use to you so
to resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not capable
so much for the advantages dags of both lies of conducts for a man of the wealthy class and oppressor
for a man of the poor working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase disadvantages

captain murdock
but mars port had flourished enough to kill it off
some of mars laws dated from the time when lawn force ment had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
the stonewall gang numbered perhaps five hundreds
even dar lax and failures hadad to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which e d out some kind of a marginal living
they were safe from protections rack a tears there none bothe to comes so far out
the shot keepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protest tol enough to reach clear back to earths
captain murdock was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
the pressure was enough to get them for him
gorden reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixt with a vague relief
i've got a free hand and were going ton the way we w on earth
your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
the first man making a shake down will get the same treatment were going to use on the stone wal boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
he picked out five of the men and clud in gorden you si will come with me
the rest of you can tem up anyway you want knight pick any r that open though came and nots go
brast gordon grin slowly as he swung a stick and murdock's eyes fell on him earth co
two years gord a mined
for a second gordon curt himself
he began wo during about security then
nobody had tried to get in touch with him
there was a crude lighting sister here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim vose for ball glad when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
moving two groups of threes that opposite sides of the street they began their beat
there was no chance to save the citizen he who was tinging from whack a there
gorden felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands
gordon's eyes popped at that
he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
the other four cops had come and reluctantly
he brought him to the grounds with a single blow across the kidneys
they rounded it up the men of a gang and one of the cop started off
to find a fern and called a wagon
were not using wagons mord told him line them up
if they tried to run they were hit from behind y they stood still they were club carefully
murdock indicated one who stood with should shaking and tears runing down his cheeks
the captain's face was a sick as gordons felt
i want the name of every man in the gang can remember he told the mean
colonel they killed me i don't know
murdock tok his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tufts
if hes turn up dead i'll know you boys responsible and ill find you
trouble began bring shortly
murdock sent one of the men topick up a second squad of six and then a third
and the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men had had been been beaten before
git a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
but the captain stirred finally sighing
now the cops are giving me covered gorden
but the stone wal gang is backing wain
rust going to be on them
brisk gorden grist ive got yellow ticket from security
mara blanked he dropped his ey slowly
what m you think wain will be reelected
nobody wants him except again of crooks and those and power
ever se a marsan elections
n your are firste he can't loose
and then how is going took and this whole plan may be blown why open
y fitted with the di of predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better fed from the fair rust dron around the corner
cost a morn but they be respectable
because is he is always honest according to have he sees its
but you got e ideas of the stuff like i had once
the groups crew more experienced and murdock was trying a new squaw every nights
it' exactly equal but nothing was here
this cole too abuses as he seen on earth
but there probably wouldn be time fort if mayre wain re elected
it was nighte outside and the fop bobs at the corners col dim lane giving him barely enough light by which de locate the way to the extemporized piecing tess
it had probably been years since any hadad dared risk it after the sun went downe
and the slow doubtful respected on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was evened more proof that hay system was working
gorden hit the signal s which and the mar speaker let out a shrill whistle
gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
you can't do it to me
i'm reformed i'm going street
y damned cops cant oa was blubbering
one look was enough the work papers had the tell tail over thickening of the signature they had showed up up on other papers obvious l forgeries
some turned away as gorden in that other co went tow work but moas of them on squeamish
when it was over the too picked up their whimpering captive
chinks the other cop had been holding the wallet
must been making a big contact and something fifty fifty
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
when gorden and jenkins came back mara tossed the money to them split it
whatever comes to hand governor
like this serial call gordon asked him
the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen near old face turning sober not
youre me some bills governor
eleven hundred fifty credits
you didn't pay up your pledge to a captain fond so id a fill
a thousand interest at ten percent we standard right
gord had heard of the friendly interest charged on the side here but he sook his head wrongs he
ha is he turned it over and shook his head
now sham me where i signed agree that say i paye back
for ast second iss face went blank then he chuckled
he poured out the bills and handed them over
thanks e thanks yourself
the kid pocketed the money cheerfully noting
the little guy new mars as few others did apparently from all sides
and if fy of the other cops had private rackets of their own is he was undoubtedly the man to finde it out and ms the informations with a beat suchlike to make his pile in a matter of months
the captain look completely beaten as he came into the r and dropped into the bench
go on accept dear it
there was a mean coming from earth on a seconds ship he would see him
the little publisher her was back at the crusader again
only gorden and shaver left
credit had been established again and the businesses were open
gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwelling spot like the dome but opake for privacy
they had been lucky
show burs volunteers were official now
fats place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
he reached automatically for the class eat the needle beer
thought he be the chips
thats mars g neck thot's comment why don she pu off the plant fats you could go back to earthy guess the other nob
guess a man gets us too anything hell may ian higher some bumps to sit around and wooed it up from when the ships come in and though this is a real old martian den off sin
there was a grin on the other's face
finally got our orders for you you it's mercury
we setch foy others the same way and they failed
let save shifted some ofer the misery around a bit and given them achs to do better
you can't stay here
there's a rocket waiting to tranship you to theon on the way to mercury right now gorden side
y and i paid her the pay we yo y you from the timely begin using your bears she's up sharping
but his old eyes were glinting
did you think we'd let you go without seen off cover he asked
i i oh dread it i'm getting old as e you tell him
he graved gourds hand and wattle down the landing plank is he shook his head
