there's i and they say in all our blood and a grain or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
margaret said mister hale as he returned from showing his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thornton made his confession of having been a shop boy
you don't mean that you thought me so silly
i rey like that account of himselfe butt th anything else he said
his statement of having been a shopboy was a thing i like best the wall
you who were always accusing people of be shopp he at helstone
i don't think mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
i really was veryain much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some part of what he said
his father dying in miserable circumstances
why it might have been in the work house
his father's speculated wildly failed and then kill himself because he could not be the disgrace
all his former friends shrunk from the discloses that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to gain his own mod dro portion of wealth
no one came forwards to help the mothers and this boy
at least no friend came forwards immediately and mis thornton is not one i fancy to wait till a tardy kindness comes to finde her out
so there lift milton
how tainted asked her father
o papa by that testing everything by the standard a wealth
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
and the poor men around him there were p because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his eyre nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
not vicious he never said that
improvident and self indulgent were his words
margaret was collecting her mothers working the tales and preparing to go to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
however out it came
papa i do think mister thornton a veryain remarkable man but purse me i don't like him at all
him id do said her fathers laughing
first me as he called it and all
i don't s him up for a hero or anything of that kind
that good night child
there was several other science of something wrong about missus hale
she in dixon held mysterious consultations in a bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was accustom when any distress of her mistress called upon her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chambers soon after dix lifted and found her mothers on her knees and as margaret's stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
but though she received presses in f words back again in such profusion as would have glad in her formerly yet she felt but there was a secret with held from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
she lay wet very long night planing how to lessen the evil influence of the milton life on her mother
a servant give dixon permanent assistance should be gott if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attention she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
visiting register offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and veryain few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she met bessy h gins in the street and stopped to speak to her
well busy how are you
bitter and not better if you know what that means
not exactly replied margaret smiling
i better not being toned to pieces by coughing the nights gr weary and tired or milton and longing to get away to the lino boola and when i think i'm father and farther off my heart sinks none no better i'm worse
margaret turned round to walk g longside of the girl in her feeble progress homeward
but for a minute two she did not speak
at last she said in a low voice
busy dish to die
bessie was silent in her turn for minute or two then she replied
not worse than many others are reckon
but what was it
you know i'm a stranger here sir perpose i'm not sir quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton
i had forgotten when i said for the time con heeded margaret quietly
i should have thought of it again when i was less busy mor go with you now
the sharp u in her eye turned to a wistful lin as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
as they turned up into a small court opening out into a squalid street bessy said
you will not be daunted de fathers at home and speaks a bit graf fish at first
but nicholas was not at home when they entered
hast bessie at last
py took go a long and feverish draught and then fill back and shut her eyes
margaret bento grew and said bessy don't be impatient with your life whatever it is will may have been
remember who gave it to you and made it what it is
now i'll not have my wench preach to
but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of lef it was to be
i believe where see and no more
that's what i believe young woman
i don't believe all i hear no not by big deal
but whose come at last and whose welcome as long as who keep from preaching on what who knows not about
its simple are not far to fetch nor hard to work
but the go and he plated the moor was margaret
telling hardly on him is a good man hes
i sometimes think i shall be murk with sorrow evening the city of god if further is not there
the feverish colour came into her cheeks and the feverish flame into her eye
but you'll be there father you shall oh the hart
she put her hand to it and became ghastly pale
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
presently the spasm that f shade death had passed away and busy roused a soft and said
i'll go to bed it's best place but catching that margaret's gan you're come again i know you will but just say it
o come to murry said margaret
margaret went away veryain sad and thoughtful
she was late for tea at home
have you met with a servant dear
murmur more that ann buckley would never have done

perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
she sounded to be such care for economical person that i should like anyone out of the same family

what's that there said dickie
replied he of a truths i hard him him not and a wing not and folks are os leaping
but she said whomsoever thou ceased awake hes the reciter
then said the eunuch a thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him
rejoined the hoch who then was the reciter point him out to me
by allah replied the fireman i tell thee the truth

what ails thee then that thou must needs reside verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk leeve for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
and he os improvised the two following in the stitch
when nose thought oz man heard the thirsting process she called to wind her fathers and her mother and her brother and their will own home then she wept and cried to the eunuch and said to him wore to thee
he who recited the first time hath recited the second dime and i heard him hard by
by allah and thou fatch not to me i wille assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee and ye shall beat thee and cast the y out
but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bringing him to me gently and do him no hurt
returned que and linger not
when it was the seventy third nine
but the uno said i will not leave thee kill thou show me who it was that recited the verses for a i dread returning into my lady without him
now when the fireman heard these words he feared for z am kan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the uno by allah it was not i and they know him not
so go thou do thy station and if thou a gain meet anyone afterpart in a of for try whether he been near or far it will be e o someone i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me
then he kissed the oo's head and spake him fair till he went away but a castrato fetched around and returning secretly came and stood behind the firemen fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
i say what made my iago what have the beater cup i drain far be from me their land to flea nor will i bow to those who blame and for such love would deal missin
then said the uno to z a machan bes we with be o my lord
o my lord continue the eunuch and shahrazad perceived in the dawn of day and seized to say her permitted say
we will do thee no upright on my son nor wrong thee ina but our objects is that thou band th gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and returning wheel and safety and thou shall have a handsome present as one who bringeth goods
then the eunuch went out zeal machan and said to him reside what verses thou knowest for my ladies here hard by listening to thee and afterthought and thy conditions
and also these
then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fi
when the eunuch so his case he wandered that them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
afterwhile they came to themselves and zut uz rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depress laughter and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
accordingly she told him all that had come to her since the separation at the cun and what had happen to her with the b hy how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother shan and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of bin how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the king they sire had sent and asked for her from shark
but now go to thy master and b him quickly to me
the chamber had cold castrato and charged him to do accordingly sa he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the talker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girding his ass and preparing for flight
she said it hath reached me or specious king that when the talker girted he us for flight and bespake himself saying o would i knew what is become of him
i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence these pages at bow me and he h made me an a couples in his crime
why didst thou say i never repeated this couplets nor do i know who re bated them when it was thy companions
but now i will not leave thee between this place and b that and what betideth thy comrade shall be tied thee
was as i feared the carles discerning but onto allah we are all returning
then the eunuch cried upon you the pages saying take him off the ass
and he answered i am the chamberlain of the mere of the masks king shark song over mar bein lum lor about dad and of the land of carson and a bring tribute and presence from him to his fathering bad
so fairy forwards no harm shall befall you till you join his grand was ear than dan
then he bad him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was trembling to the amir of the maskers and was bounded to king mar with presence and the tribute of syria
soe was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the king's son sharpen and may came sultan over his father's rail
and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet zu a machan for quoth they his name blight of place and he hath a sister news hut oz a man hies the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for all he just and none wet what is become of them
so he turned to the wuz undone and said to him badly your tail is a wander of wonders

when the mean sir heard these words he rejoiced with grey joy and said o chamberlayne tell me the tail of the twain and what befell them and the cause of their long absence
z can bowed his head awhile and then said i accept the positions put indeed there was not refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counseled h well and wisely and sat him on the right way
then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother shark
after a while the dust dispersed and there appeared underrated the army of back dad and carson a conquering host like the pool tide sea and charade perceived the dawn of day and seized to say her permitted say
when it was a seventy eighth night

kit lent out and re turned with three or four muskets and as many pipes
the stills that ranged bot sides was might that of death

they swarmed up and from a sherman's palings as thickest as they could jan together and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise
some sung out ti down the fens tear down the fence
the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
sherman run his eye slow along the crowd and wherever its strut the people tried a little out gaze e but they couldn't they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
the average man's of coward
because they' afraid the man's friends will shep them in the back in the dark and its je what they would do
so they always a quit and then a man goes in the night with a hundreds mast cowards at his back and lunches the rascal
you didn't wanton to come
but a mob without any man at the head of it his beneath pitifulness
now lead and take your half a man with he tsin he has gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all a par and went tearing off every witch way and buck harness he healed it after them looking tolerable chef
he can't b ke careful
they argue and tried to keep a out but he wouldn't listen and a hole show come to aus stands do
and warn or two women begin to spring
so then the ringing master he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he could let him ride if he thought he could say on the horse
it warn't funny to me though i was all but trembled to see his danger
and a horse a going like a house a fire too
he shed him so thick the kind of clo up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits
why it was one of his own min
an but never mind arrested his outfit it was jist wh but it was awful funny
the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and haw hart till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him doone another time
tor any people sings out
the duke says yes

but a big fine looking may jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on
just a word gentlemen they stopped to listen
what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk they show up and sail a rest of the town

we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding downstream all dark and still and edging towards a middle of the river nobody saying a word

when i waked up just to daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and morning to himself

he was often moning in mourning at way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying hole little liz'beth

just loud as i could yell
which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to how
the can dues was all black and he day looked real swell and starchy
why before he look like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when hed take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he'd walked right out of the ark and maybe was o a vitus himself
jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my pile ready

the young chap was mighty thankful sie was tough work toting his baggage such weather
he asked king where he was going and the king total he'd come down a river and landed at the others village this morning and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farmer there the young fellow says

so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
when we got there she set me dan in a split bottom chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
well it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt

i had my minded on the children not a time i wanted to get them out to one side and pumped them a little to find out who i was
pretty soon she made the cold chill streak down my back because she says
i see it warn't a bit of used to try to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
so i says to myself here' another place where i got to rest the truth
i open myth to begin but she graded me and hustled me behind the bed and says hear he comes
children don't you say a word
i see i was ina fixed now
missus felt she je for him and says
hass he come no says her husband

un easy she says i am ready to go distracted
he must a come and you've missed him along a road

why silas look y up the road ain't that somebody coming
the old gentleman stared and says
i hain't no ida who is it

being time sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till bin by i hear steamboat coffin along down a river
then i says to myself s'pose time saw comes dan on ned boat
but i am h she you please that you have seen my lady
i knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
her conversation has more charms and can be in mere beauty and a humor and disposition would make a deform person a pure lovely
why didn't you not send me that means and a gain
wh the bess on i have a squireen that is as good as a night
inne we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish an occasions i cannot toll which is strangers
all the people that i had ever and my life refused will brought again upon the stage like richard the third's ghosts to approach mew and all the kindness is covers could make i had for you was lid to my charge
my best quantities if i have any that are good served but for aggravations of my fault and i was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in this
tis a strange change and i'm veryain sorry for it but ill swaying or not hu to helped it
is to fish is a squire of things and has so many mistresses th anybody ne pretend a share in him and be believed though i have the honour to be his near neighbour to speak freely i cannot bragg much that he mixing ne court to me and i know' no young woman ino country that he does not visit often
i thin my youngest brother comes down with him
i can know soon give you some little hints where about they live but you know them presently an meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
but it seems dis gentleman is not so easy access but you made mowed something due to me if i inclined him to loo graciously upon you and therefore there is not much hound done
i have missed f fits and have had but five and have recovered so much strength may be ventured meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
but besides i can give you others
i am here much more ar of people's way than in tow when my aunts and such as pretend and interest in me in a power over me do so persecute m dear good nature youll take it so ill that they are not excepted as i would live in a hollow tree to avoid them
you will think him altered and if it be possible more melancholy than he was
if marriage agrees no better with other people than it thus with him i shall pray that all my friends m escape it
well in earnest if i were prince that lady should be my mistress but i can give no rule to anyone else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing your heart suh may be infinitely taken with one i should not value at all for so says a justinian wye providence has ordained it that by dead different humans everybody might find something to pleas themselvs little without envying their neighbors
the matter is not gray for confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the worlds and should be best please never to be known in it w any occasioned whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly avoided one must satisfy oneself by doing nothing that one neat care nos
if i had a picture that will fit for you he should have it
how caning me talk of defying fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you could
i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as he say but i am sudden he knows the utmost of the injuries you have received from her
we have had another de beat but much more call me
and besides there was a time when we are ses when different to on another did i do so then or have i lend it since
i have been studying how tom cheek might come by his intelligence and i very believe he has it from my cousin pets
how kindly do i take the civilities of your fathers in earnest you cannot imagine hog is let appease me
wouldn't would leave me and then i could believe i shall not always a occasion for it
by poor lady vavasor is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against the protector and did not discover it
she has told now all that was told her but vows you will never safe from whence she heed we shall see what the her resolutions errors unalterable as those of my lady calash
i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
i never saw any one yet that did not look sink and out of countenance n ever knew a wedding well designed but one and that was of two persons that time enough i confessed to contrive it and nobody to pleas in themselves
the truth is i could not endure to be missus bride in a public wadding be made the happiest personal earth
do not take it ill for would endure it if i could rather and fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
yet in earnest your father will not find my brother paid and wanting and civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters in me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set a higher value upon her sister and she deserves
my aunty no longer gone in yester they that i was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome t heeded

because you find fault with my others letters this is like to be shorter than they i did not intended it so th i can assure you
i do not finder why i'm told i was so extremely when i believed you love me
but i am called upon
directed foyer master
i see your conan cid when you please and was authority but i deserve it i confessed and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded for a veryain good principle in me
we to her not that our tongues lie more one side our ms and the other for fear of overturning it
you are satisfied i hope at this that i scape drowning
but i am troubled much you should mi so ill or journey to so little purpose indeed i wr by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my matters
oh well go you will be but alas
for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to not de care an evening perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission
they laugh to hear me say that one unkind word draw all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expected kindness should increase everyday if it will possible but never lessen
we go broad all bee and play all night and se all pre when yet time
we and sober earnest now i would not live thats a twelvemonth to gain all that king his lost unless it were to give it him again
will you be so goodnature
he has one son it tis the finest boy that e you saw and has an noble spirit but yet stands in that all of his fathers that one word from him is as much as twenty ripping
you must give me leave turner tain youse ass with discuss of the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
not to knowing you would come home i can assure you nor for any other kegan on my won but with a cousin of my that had long designed to make us of spot with him and did not miss offer aim
in my life i never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and nor old woman who passes for which could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reason were people than he was
ever sins disadventure i have had some great a belief and all things were dis nature that i could not forbear laying a peas card with nine peas into under my door yesterday it was informed by it that my husband's name should be thomas how do you like that
she poured her hair down turned his good back put her feet in the fender and took part into her lap all of which arrangements signy fi that something very important had got to be thought over in sled
the more propos was was the more crete
act righted and lighted and maybee d the consequence of that knight's fan
just suppose it is true that he does ask mee and ice yes
what a spiteful thing i am
i d do so much for od at home how i should have te a
that ms see how cannot begin
he has known her on her lives and has a good influence over her
now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the al temptation assailed her more than once the weak for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided she missed the bless and little in the views that used to put a certain flavor of romans into her du h working days
i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments oppositions that nosed attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence and she suspected
it was that indescribable something which women a quick to see and feeling men who have beens the lie and good mothers
this had especial charm to pully for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to everyone
lately this changed especially towards poy and it followed her more than she would confess evened to herself
at first she tried to think she could but unfortunately hearts as so contrary that they won't be omen to reason will or even quit ude
poy felt a very cori of friendship for mister sydney but not one particle of the l be the only kind and which laugh came b sully paid
this finished polly's indecision and after dead night never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl that the spies of the old even her composition
when cit came polly studded as usual for visit to back and best but good n resist stopping at the shores to leave rely passive fan that was calling time
a foolish little speech to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tender heed girl trying to the duty
take hold of mass charley's hand miss may me and b py like willy and flossie said the maid
at the street corner a black eyed school poy was parting from a rosy face school girl who music worl he was reluctantly sur ring
how he got there was never very clear to puny but there he was flushed and a little out of pat but looking so glad to see her did she had not the hart to p stifles as she had fully in turner to be when they meant
july couldn't hep it it there was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
that is way ike it to the wor answered poy
she didn not mean to tell put his fright was so agreeable she forgot herself
but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she joyed to meant her fords though she won't ow it and who sprise you some day by the amount of heart and sense and couldn she has got
thank you no
how lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
asked be o for young man laying a trap into which polly immediately fell
he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being both bailed and gens with softer settle the matter at once for polly's sake as paris's own
so and you made a last poy and remark he said quietly watching your face keenly all the wire i thought so we i'm going out of town when business for several weeks so you can ensure your little bit of country without being annoyed by me anny it
she thought she had a good deal of the coquet in her and i've no doubt that with time and draining she would have become a veryain dangerous from person but now she was fat ors pound and straight forward by nature evened to tell a white like level
he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorse for face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only love as she would ever have had read his answer a excepted servants
prey did not returned to a favour walk till she learned for miny that uncle had ry left ton and then she found that his friendly com bony and conversation was what had made the ways of pleasant af
lugging too and for as usual p's thews with you
perhaps she child him
utterly done with and laid upon the shelf
manes at the other day she wished was a pitching so she could paddle in the puddles and not fs above revers
now don't be affected poy but just tell like a dear has not hep posted
don't y you thinking means to
truly july fir
ion mean to be prying but i really thought he did
we i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have
i just gave him the hint and he took it
he meant to go away before that so then thinkers heard is broken or mind what city tatler say
he understood and being a chant leman made no firs
but parry it would have been a grand thing for you
i aught you know i preferred to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days
never mind for the business was it suffices to say that was a good beginning for a young men like tom who having been born and bread in the most conservative class of the most conceded city in new england needed just the health fe hardly social influences of the rest to wit in his fuse and make a man of him
fortunately everyone was so busy with the miss sa rations that there was no time for romans of any sort and the four young people worked together as soberly insensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not buttered up in their respective hearts
pity that the enter comes soon but the hour did its work and rend its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind but the young folks did not see at them for the ice with d because of the partings that must be
if it had not been f two things i fear she mer would have stood a sum and town but sydney of and called to his vacation came and le voluminous close bons of py the gulled days
time weel ones a week to his mother but the letters were short in not veryain satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women less like to hear
no i'm only tired had a good dear to do lately and the doll whether mixes meats awe aver brew
forgive me polly but i can't up saying it for this there and i wanted be as true to you as you were to me if i can
at i never deceive myself but it seem ass if there was a gens of happiness for me
thank haven't for that
cite poy with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice
poor polly was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say
none be needed h tell her face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hider head in the sofa cushion like g foolish post which and the hundreds are after
once or t eyes but sort of chokingly and i thought it was only some little flotation
it was cood of me not a guess before
it was tender earnest and defiant but fanny forgot the defense of her own lover and admiration of polls loyalty to hearse for this faithful all absorbing laugh was a newer relation to fanny who was used to hearing her friends past of two or three love a year un calculate the respective fur use but almost as much cess as the young man discussed fortunes of the girls they wished for but couldn not afford to marry
i hope maria bailies only thinks her she added softly for could not bere to heaven and disappointed again
said fanny turning hop for all at mons
suppose ill say a word to tom just in coy after his heart in ad gnu away you know and' give him a chance to tell me if theres anything detur
bear it people always too par things somehow answered polly looking as of sentence had beens passed upon her
it was very different window from the last above the girls
a fanny wonder to show him what she could do toward making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded b than she suspected on spit of many fails and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mister sydney at least for he was more the house front seemed determined to prove the change of fortune made not defence to him
she kept much at home in the days work was ton finding it pleasantly to creaming of a book or soon alone and to exert herself evening to go to the shores
polly was not at all like herself that winder and those nears to her saw in woe edited most
for n was so o absorbed in business that heno the whole baily question and left them in other darkness
then came bugging in the pony one day looking if she put hiding of such grat ty that she hardly knew how to tell them
but if worked baskets were gied with powers of speech they could tell styes more true and tender than any reread
she had even been in society before the revolution
it was her pleasure and her vanity drag in these names on every pretext
every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priests m seigneur saint frost wis gave it to mc your say julian mason your sa julian gave it to monseigneur saint you sous ms your saint you se gave to mons your sain procopius et er et cetera
and the schoolgirls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under the bales charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers frown
it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
the rule of fervor did not forbid this
she would not show the subject to anyone
thus that furnished a subjective comment for all those who were occupied or board in the convent
some mune chaplet some authentic relic
they lofts themself and conjectures
wh the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making and effort to fly but the dancers laughing with u canal air

general observations on preserves confectionery ice and dessert dishes
the excels preserving them with sugar is a serious su objection for excepted sugar used in considerable qualities the successes veryain uncertain

the reason lat off d emptied out of the preserving pan into an earth and pan is that the answer of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
from this exampled to process of preserve in puce by sir would be easily comprehended
it should be dried in the stove or oven on a seat and turned everye six or eight hours fresh powdered chug be sic it over them everye time their turned
in this way it is also that orang and women chips are preserved

so regan made a sword and cigaret tried it with the blow and lump of iron and the sword broke
then signa went to his mother and as for the broken pieces of his fathers blade and gave them to regan
so cigaret said that sword would do
then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along left a deep valley
but cigaret waited till half of him had called over the pit and then he thrust the sword graham right unto his very heart
s gig said i would touch none of it if by losing that i should never die
but all m die and no brave man let's death frightening him from his desire

then sicker growed back in met region and regan asked him a rose fafner his heart and let him taste of it
sis gould put the heart of fafner on mistaken most at it
there's cigaret roasting faton's heart for another when he should taste of it himself and weren all wisdom
that let him do then ride over him felled to the place were brim hilled sleeps
there m she sleep till thou comes for her waking rises up and rife for now sure she will swear the vow fearless of breaking
then he took the helmet off ahead of the sleeper had behold she was a most beautiful lady
then cigaret rode away and he came to the house of the king who had a fair daughter

cosette had waked up
jean valjean had paced he near the frere
you will wake for me at a lady's house i shall come to fetch ye
everything is ranged and nothing is said fort laval
i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
thats where the difficulty loves
it is easy enough with the childe will parry her out
and she will hold her tolly i answer for that
th shea v grumbled more to himself than too jean valjean
you understand father madden the government one notice it
jean vardon stared him straighter ne i and thought that he was raving
fuss liver went on
it is to morrow that i'm to bring you in the priors
then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fourche leval was to render to the community
that the nun who had dined that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the fault under the altar of the chapel
that the priors and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil wish of the deceased
that he fourche laval was to nail up the coffin in the cell raised the stone in the chapel and blower the corpse into the vaults
and then that there was another the empty coffin
what isis that an te coffin
asked jo valjean fish lover replied
what coffin what administration
flivver who was seated sprang up as th a ba had burst under his chair you
know for chiful what you have said mother crease a fiction is dead
and i ad and father madeline is buried art
you are not li other men saw the madeline
this offers the means but give me some information in the first pace
howl is the coffin six feet
it is a chamber on the ground floor has a grated windows opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shatter and two doors one needs into the convent the other into the church what church
the church in the street that the church which anyone can enter
have you the kings to those to doors
no i have the key to the door which communicates with the congruent the porter has the key to the draw which c cates with the che
only to allow the undertake is men to enter when they come to get the coffin
wh nails up the coffin wh d
who spreads the poor lavore it
not another man except the police doctor conan enter the deed ram that is e written on the wall
city hide me in that ring to night when ever one is asleep
about three cock in the afternoon
i shall be hunger heh i will bring me something
you can come and now me up and the coffin at two o'clock
fs li over a coiled and cracked his finger joints but that is impossible
bah impossible to take a hammer and drives and nails in a pin
jean valjean had been in wor straits the mess
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
to have himself nailed i in a case and carriage off like a bail of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to economize his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of gere valjean's blue me talents
you surely must have a gim that you will make a fewe halles here and there around my mouth and you will now on the top plan on loosely good and what if you should happen to calf for to see
a man who is making his escape does not cough all sneeze
who is there who is not said to a cat do come in
the over prudent cats as they are and because they at cans sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
but jan valjean's corner prevailed over him in spite of himselfe grumbled
if youre are sure of coming out of the coffin r i am sure of getting outs of the grave
and old oo of the old school the great digger puts the corpses in the grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
i shall follow that is my business
theirs holts the undertake is men not a rope per and you'll coffin fir lower you down
the priests as the pairs mates the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
one of two things will happen he will either be sob or he will not be sober
that is settled father fish leval or what go well
on the fallen day as the sun was declining the veryain rare passes by on the boulevard dy men hulled off the hats to an old fashioned hearse ornamented with skulls cas brons and tears
this hurst contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a hing corpse with drooping ars
a morning coach in which could be seen a priest in his circles and acquire boy in his red cap followed
behind it came an o man in the garments of the laborer limp along
the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at might in winter in this cemetery they was subjected to especial discipline
these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalid
dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it
the bourgeois did not car much about being buried in the voter har it hinted at poverty hela cham if y pace
to be buried in peril shee is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognized as elegant
the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the incorrect of jean valjean into the deader all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch lets reb him passing that the burial of mother cas fiction under the altar of the convent is a perfectly vial offense in us
it is one of the false which resented on it duty
the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences
in the cloister which is called the government is only intermeddling with authority an interference which is always questionable
make as many lords as you please men but keep them for yourselves
a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
fashionable limped along behind the hearse in a veryain contented frame of mind
jean valjean's composure was one of these powerful tranquillity which are contagious
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
he played with father messene
he did what he knocked with him he made him dance according to his wind
the permission for intent must be exhibited
he was a sort of laboring m who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried matter under his arm
the man replied the greater
the wiv dinna yes
you i
father miss chan is the grave digger he was
flush of what had expected anything but this but a grave digger could die
it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do din themselves
he had hardly the strength to stammer
but he persisted feebly father mie and is the grave digger
do you know who afther in lars he isn't jo of reed wine
but you are a jolly varra
i you not comer weil go have a drink together present
the man replied
he limped more out of anxiety than from infamy
the grave digger walked on in front of him
vs one pasted the unexpected caviar once more and review
fuca wal who was illiterate but veryain sharp understood that he had to dear with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
the sir fatherless innes dead
the man relighted completely
the goody god consulted his nook book which shows when the time is up it was father mostyn hiss turn for misty and died
stammered force laval it is made
you are peasant eye and the perusian
for she wore thought i am lost
they only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small ary leading to the nun's corner
and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who turning a phrase well
fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter reins clock the wheels and retarded its speed
my fathers was a porter at the pretty name tom home
but he have reverses he had losses u chang i was obliged to renounce the profession of ah but i am still a public writer
but so you are not a grave digger then
returned fs leval clutching is brat feeble as it was
here a remo becomes necessary
a f shave was at his anguish offered to drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
the greve digger went on with a superi smile
one must eat
the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake
yes but if i should already ask for something what
well do it for me v swear to you thy don't love you as the others have loved you
there botts and the door wretch
i don't know how it is but it's seems gan as if i do
i'll go i can't keep my eyes open
it seems to me as if this sleeping city be longs to me i searched my memory for their names of those whose happiness i had once envied and i couldn not recall one without finding myself the happier
education fly feeling the says of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sentinels so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first cast of of love all the more ardent because they seen so pure
the more girl believes in goodness the more isle will she give way if not tor lover and these to love for being without mistrust she is without force and to w her love as a triumph that can be gained by any young men of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
then how surely must they desire the worlds which is hidden from them how surely must find it tempting how surely must be listened to the first' voice which comes to tell it secrets through their bars un blessed the hand which she is the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil
with them the body has worn out the soul the senses half burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
they loved by profession and not by instincts
when a creature who has all her past to reproach herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere ars civil love of which she had never felt for self kep able when she has confessed her love how absolutely the man whom she loves dominates her
they know not what proof to give
in order to disturbed the laborers in the fields was one day devoured by a wolfe because those whom he had so often deceived no longer the leaf in his cries for help
this is the same with these unhappy woman were he loved seriously
but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough and soul to receded without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this m drained at one drought all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every others
but to return to the first day of mal s
whenever home i was in the state of mad gaiety
the woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him
how why
my whole beam was exalted into joy at the memory of the words yet exchanged dinging that first night
here on my orders to night at a boville
cond the third and treat
the boxes filled one after another
only worn remained empty as page box
at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which by eyes had been almost constantly fixed opened and marguerite appeared
d she loved me enough to believe that a more beautiful she loos that happier i should be
what is the magter with you to night said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
who should go to bed she replied with that ironic error which went so well with her delicate and witty face
where at home
yous love me can you ask
because she you don't like seeing him
none the less h was very unhappy all the rest of the evenings and went away very sadly afterguard the count and marvell g into the carriage which was wing for them at the door
i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
you in the way marguerite but how
well you might have had a woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see too more arrive
during this remark marguerite looked at me attentively
my dear prudence i answered you do not know what you are saying
yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as as my door you will want to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to led you go away blaming me for saying no
because i am watched and the least suspicions might to me the greatest harm
is f really the only reason
if there wore any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
on the sleep you care for me a little a great feel
i fancied for a moment th i might give myself that happiness for sits months you would not have it you insisted un in the means
well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
i listened and i gazed their marguerite would admiration
when i thoughted that this marvellous creature whose feet i had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts by part in her life and that i was n yet content with wh she gave me i asked if ms desire had indeed limits when said spied as probably as mine had been it reached after something furthers
truly she conceded we poor a creatures of chance have fantastic desire and inconceivable loves
we are not allowed to have hearts on the pali of being hooded down and of ruining are credit
we no longer long to ourselves
who stand first in their self a steam last ee steen
never do give you advice which is not lucratively
in me little and off to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they get dresses or a blent out of them and that they can drive and am pera from time to time or come to our box at the future
such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and old a is neither protects mor consols
i thought i could at set the live which yo mee o what would youll have
what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
marit hired out with his long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough f up her the chief to her lifts and from that to o her eyes
marit do with me as you will i amr slave your dog but in the name of haven't tear up the letter which are rote to you and did not made me leave you to morrow it would kill me
marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing into me with a smile infinite sweetness said
here it is i have brought the back
i tore a letter into fragment and kissed with tears the handed that gav to me
look here puddens do you know what he wants said marguerite
he wants you to forgive him
one has too but he once more than that what then
i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled

one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes
thou shalt have thy liberty he cried even though thou shouldst when me in pieces the moment thou'rt free
it had had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful fairy with filmy wings which shone like rainbows in the moonlight
at this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten
scissors growed giant's height and save us from the ogs might
he could see the ogre standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the chasm and gnashing as teeth each one of which was as big ass in mill still
the sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as vast as and speak would carry him
thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this dismal spot well i have the power to help thee
he lifted the scissors and with on stroke to strike the web and gave the flights read him
a think glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole
the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors
as he uttered the words the scissors leaped out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shutters as easily as through a cheese
in a very short time the prince had crawled toot the opening
while he stood looking around him in bewilderment a fire flyer lighted down his hi flashing its little lande in the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me de gid d to who a place of safety

to stand between two religions from one of which you would not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to that like souls
marius was clear eyed and he required the true light
the half lights of doubted him
whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march furthers
he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his fathers now take a step which should a strange him from that father
his discomfort was augment by all the reflections which occurred to him
in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
they soon elbowed him abruptly
request cafe to come in talking me said marius
what is to become of you said ker for
what are you going to do i do not know
silver gold here it is
you will then have only a pair of trousers a weskit a hat and a coat and by boots

he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments they went to the watchmakers

the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the s pots
i have ten francs left said marius
that will be swallowing a tongue very ivery fast or a hundreds veryain slowly
one mornings as return from the law school murrays found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistol that is to say sixth hundreds francs and gold and a sealed box
maria sent back the thirty louis to his aunt with the respectable letter in which he stated that he had suspicious means of subsistence and that he should be able thence forth to supply all his needs
at that moment he had thew francs left
he perceived that it was no good talking to the old men and at the principal person in the house was the mother
before her he decided cater his pearls
the princess was distracted and d dot know whats to do she felt she had send against kate
well doer decide our fa said the precis tell me everythin
he's there hope she meant to say but her looks quivered and she could not outer the question well doctor
as he wed the princess went out of the sigh
the family doctor respectfully ceased in idle of his ovation
and there are indications m attrition nervous in excitability and so on
the question sins thus and passive indications of to berks process what is to be done to maintain intrusion
yes sets an understood thing responded a c elated physician again to waning in his watch
they pardon is the os eber denon or shall have the drave
he asked ah it is
o well then i can do it in twenty menes
and how out it to her abroad asked the canto doctor
what is wanted is the mean of approving nutrition enough loring
the family doctor listen attentively and respectfully
but in favor a fore and travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calle e
and then the mother wishes it he had
ah well not hes to be sure l them go only those driven quacks are mischievous
o times a bor any went to the dor
the sombre to doctor announced to the princess a feeling if what was due from him dated his doing so that he ought too cat abased once more
oh no only if you dus princess home this way
and the mother of company by the doctor went into the drawing room to ky
when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tears
she answered in and all at once got up furious
excuse me doctor but there is really ne object in this
is is the thir tan you've ask me the same th
the celebrated doctor did not take offence
nervy res ability he said the princess when had left the room however i had finished
and the doctor began side to fickly explaining to the princess as in exceptionally intelligent woman the conditions of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certain the harmless
at the question should they go abroad the doctor punched in a dee meditation as though resolving awaited bo
finally his decision was pounced they were to go abroad but to put no fate in foreign quacks and to apply to him and any need
it seem as though some piece gould fortunate had come to pass after the doctor had young
the mother was much more cheerful as she went back to a daughter and can he p fortin to be more cheerful
educated people of the upper closes are trying to stifled ever brewing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social v
this is absolutely int erects
in the social conceptions of lifely is suppose that since the a of life is found and groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrificed their own interest for the enters of the group
the shanks of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
the man who was controlled by moral influence ac in accordance with his own dix
the basis of authority is boy whiles
the possibility of applying bodily violence the people is g provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison and submission to one will
these bands of armed men said missus to a single will are a constant the army
the army has always been and still he is the bases of power
power is always in the hands of those who control y ary an almo power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything in court popularity of the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
indeed it could not be otherwise
only under those conditions could the social organisations be justified
the sinse this is not the case and on the contry men and power always far from being sings through the veryain fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
evenin if there was want a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition amen to of violence the existence of an authority to restrain such valance was an advantage because the violence of the government was lessen the violent of individuals one cannot see that this advantage could not be lasting
between the members of one state subject to a single authority the stripe between the individual seemed still less and a life of the state seems evening more se cure
it was produced on one hand by the national growth the populations and on the other by struggling gog west
after conquest the power of the emperors puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
but this justification is never more than temporary
internal dissensions disappear only in proportioned to the degree of oppression deserted by the authority over the dis sentient individuals
govern authority even if it d suppressed private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of viols which tend to become greater and greater in proportioned to the duration and strength of the government
and therefore the i oppression of the oppress always goes on growing up the furthest lemon beyond which a cannot go that killing the goose with the gold nice
the most convincing example of this as be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient time seeded that conquest
so it is always been
footnotes the fact that in america the abuses of authority exist in spite of a small number of their troops not only fails had his screw this position be positively confirms it
the upper class know that an army fi the thousand will soon be insufficient and do longer belong on inks men they feel thats curdy of their positions depends on the incas drink of the army
the reason to which he gave expressions essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the pops engaged swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of the days so carefully distributed the revers so that the regiments from the frontier of their stationed in central districts and the regiments from the centre our stationed on the frontiers
the meaning of c privy speech put into plan language is that funds are needed notre assist foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the in slave toiling masses
and this abnormal order of thanks is maintained by the army
but there is not only one goverment there other governments sporting their such by violent in the same way and are always ready to pounds down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its in slate subjects
and so every goverment needs an army also the protect its buoy from its neighbour brigands
this increase is contagious as montescue pined ob h and fifty years ago
every increase in the army of one' state with the aim of self defence against its subjects becomes a sort of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
the despotism of the government always increases with the strength of the army and his external successes and the res of ness of a government increases with its internal despotism
the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse the universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers who obtained at the least possible express
and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practiced upon them all citizens have become their own impress hers
this inconsistency as become obvious and universal m thia service
in fact the whole significant of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitory ins of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life the groups of cans
but with universal multi service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get it of the cruelty of strife and the in security of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had me to avoid
but in set of doing that they exposed to individual to the same necessity of strife sus toity strike with individuals of other states for strife with neighbours
the taxes raised from the people for war preparations of sort of the graved de part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
the danger of war ever ready to break out rin iss all reforms of li social li vain and fruitless
but the fat sniff ince of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction and her in social conception of life is not only apparent and that
governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defence but that is not true
there an needed principle they against their subjects and every man under conti hers military service be comes in accomplice and all that acts of violence are the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
and for the sake of but how i making them
i'm expected for the sake of a state of make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious a man peace family security and human dignity
except with the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil dispose persons in our own country
we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminished the number that be can only be done by change of en warming and moral influence
so that the justification of stayed violence on the ground of the protection and gives from evil spoke persons evened it had some foundation three of for centuries ago has none whatever now
except the state they tell us we should not have any religions education culture means a punic so on
without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything
this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
the great extension of means of communications and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state in formic societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
without governments nations were bein layed by their neighbors
the government they tell us with its army is necessary defends from nator stay to who might en slavs
and if defence against barbarous as nations is meant one thousandth parts of the troops now under au would be ale sufis for that purpose
the power of the state far from being a security against attacks of our neighbors exposes on the contrary the much greater dangerous such tax
evened looking at e practically wegg that is to say all the burdens lid on him by the states no man can failed to see that for him personally to comply with a state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantages than to refuse to do so
to resist would need independent thought of effort of which every man is not capable
so much for the advantages disadvantages of both lines of conducts for a m of the wealthy class and oppressor
for a man of the poor working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase disadvantages
say you now supper
chris looked formic plated flash like to a car jack can spark plug
no news a john ban that's chickie's

christ it off once more passing a bleak little victory and church perch on hill above mister work's house
an empty lot could e int to buy church lan gave a look of isolations of ail shake bric building it sir mister wicks both house and place of business
no longer winging town back back door that opened a water street the space between the house in this guns an abbe had been made into a meat up along flower garden fenced off for the sidewalk by box shrugs and the white picket fence
a livid yellow stained a arising beyond the factories and blaye clouds lowered and tumbled above
the air was growing chill and christ decided the finish the job
all at once you wondered how his mother was and everything and am and pinched and tighten itself
at the foot of the hill and he reached the house
there were three things that always caught his eye a mein the litter of dust he pieces
ot left the coil of rope in the center the model of a sailing ship in a grain glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of the negro boy in baggy trousers track jacket and whit turban
but the name still showed at the pow and many a time christ safe at home and bed and sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabelle t
he had never seen an he one go into mister vickers's shop now he thought b
how then did a lamp and what did ever sell
a sudden corne walk him from his dream
of the many times either's amon mister refers when now and poured overpeer ship in the nubian boy he it had never gone into mister hooker's shop
some now alone till some one should answer the bell they looked eagerly if uneasily around him to
but with one windows the lower outside the longed narrow shop with sombre
head the handing beams crossed it from one side to the others
mister looks back being tore the source of light chris could nancy his face
the double fans of minute wrinkles breaking from i condy a temple and joining with those over the sheep bones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the dome forehead
line toughs some white fuse above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarians hair but what drew and held chris's gaze were the olden men's eyes
crisp linked and looked again yes they were still there
chris swallow it is vice came bac him
y sir he said
i set your sign and i know boy who eats the job
his a scool min
juss name is in new reeling is the charm
i i just wondered if the pe was open
what he saw was a fresh cheek lad tall for thirteen sturdy with in sil and good humour his face and something sent it of an impel him about his eyes
he guessed there must be alive the fire that room beyond
with that have fear ment jakie gig skinning the job sir
but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mindes why do not see the reflection of the headlights at the cars moving upo around the car of wall er street not hill towards the licks nos
the rome seemed overly still
then in that second d turned and faced about
the wide bow wind it was there before him and three objects he like best showing frosty in the moonlight that towards in from across the water
gras the water what is a free away
it was no longer there no the high walls and smoke stacks of back ris to be seen t
aware houses were still there
flabbergasted and breathless chris was on aware that he it move closer appear out the window and every direction
no electric signs no lath lit streets
when the peoples dro store and stood but half an hour before rose the ruse of what was eventually an inn
and courtyard his firstly met by flaring torture too shilling the swinging sign hung on the post
the posts planted at the edge of which was now a broad in money row
the coach with it stop piled hive with legged stamped aholt beside the fl courtyard
e moved int to the end the coach rattled off to the stable
my window has a pah for those few are to see
the learning a magic was by means easy
he had told his master at once he ab simeon goslin his horde of money his hiding places for it
chris therefore threw himselfe all the primaries in his tasks
one afternoon when he had returned after arst to mister wicker's study he saw that there was something knew in the room a ball with a goldfish in it stood in the tablet mister works not to be seen
what should all and do first
how you've been prove my boy he exclaimed it' not time for you to try missus h got a change any
sup a chained and kitchin back
mister worker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for christo get up his courage
that is nothing happened with a voice like a whip mister rigger said started once
a sensations spread faster and faster
his head swam any felt faint no ll sick but he persisted through the final words
he thought n with thout a feeling a pride and commences experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and to light some little time lapped be wore mister wicker's voice boom but oz by
seventy four book one the returning
the figure shoes carved in some eastern style at curved up pointing toes
that all at once the idea cam chris
if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
he squatted on his haunches examined the carved wooden figure intently and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companions
but how did one a change inanimate to en of it
gris got up and stole back to mister work's door
he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his rome above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was reeling empty with sir loons proper shape and opened the doors of the cupboard at de far and of the room
the afternoon raining before increased in storms
thus gain too hours before its time thunder snarled in the sky
certain elements were be mixed and poured the proper time
mister worker began moving about upstairs the full boards creaked crank and still chris could not leave until the potion fumed and glowed
with infinite caution chris closed the door silently behind him in running light beef ward greeks the figure of the negro boy
it was as it the step mess melted
under hiss eyes wen folds of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its rounding upon the coat and o the face
the wind grin lucent the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of car flowers moved a the bo capful
they went down to their corner's first
guess mister finny went to his quarters i don't member seeing him cross deck or come over that way at all

the mabel was nearing ted

chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin
c l my boy boomed up out the captain as blue eyes abruptly keen and pedantry
mister finney wan be sometime on deck we cannot be own heard in here
his face rose with nervousness that this might do il do was an answer and he stood stiff and stone before captain lizards
li captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say i do
the ship had more to mean wife mother all family
and pause fingering this lower lip the looking sideways in reflective fashion at chris standing before him
we shall say no more but id trust you under stand re spoons of belting you have
a ship its cargo in its men will be in your hands
y sir i think i can do it safely or should not try sir
captain lizards round pink faced creased in its winning smile
you then went on to describe what else was to father the covering in the ship with leaves to make it blend with it surroundings
to come a flash was not a word the captain or any w else of his time he had understood
what can be said during that time sir cristo ask
i am somewhat skills in medicaments i have to be as a captain of ship and crew know it
i shall say that you are in my own cabins i can care for you
not since he had left mister rook and chris felt such confident as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
he knew now that his absence for his log as he had o to be away would be covered up and satisfaction inly a counted for
their conversations had taken some of a while

but hermon was that in the mood to sher joyous revel and he fact me said so although immediately after his returned he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honour of the seventieth birthday of the old sculptor ef
she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour
so the artist found himselfe obliged to relinquish opposition
the banquet was to begin in a fewe hours yet he could not let the day passed without seeing daffy and telling her the words of the oracle
he longed with ardent yarning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescue demeter might yet be the work of mirus had again mastered him
the approval as well as a doubts which had arise in others strengthened his opinions although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts
then he went directly to the neighboring palace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered and impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy
when hermon entered the residence of the grams in the palace the guess h already assembled
the place by hermon side which alt had chosen herself would then be given up to ar sin
true an interesting conversation still had power to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight and referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyment as blindness debarred him
a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and woman to whom not hadad bound him save the presence of the same host
creates had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair haid nego had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing ar s's praises among his professional associates
his son had been the royal dam's first' husband and she had deserted him to marry less makers the aged king of thrace
the king's sister the object of his love cried hermon incredulously
we wen are ely as old as we look and the legs entiring woman of this beauty of forty practised os which give for the appearance of twenty five yet perhaps the king values her intellects more than hy pison and you wisdom of a hundreds serpents is certainly united in this woman's head

how long he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the whole city with delight
when he did finally semen you he fl things which must have wounded you
that is going too far replied hermon
he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arca had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in roads
the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and al thea eagerly confirmed the statement
h mam mist into the parent silence
the royan was just beginning to prise arca also as a special friend and cone of the sculptures art when creates her mons fellow student asked the blind artist and be out of this beautiful companions why his demeter was placed upon a pedestal which to others as well as himselfe seemed too high for the size of the statue
yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of score at him
a woman who yarns for the regard of all men and makes love of toy easily lessens demands she imposes upon individuals
only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and altho did not wish to lose heron's regards
how indifferent to look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed her she spoke that so long as you was still a genuine creating artist the case was different

to offer resistance would have been madness for even hm mont perceived by the loud clanking of weapons round them de greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prison the place of execution
was he to be led to the executioner's block
what pleasure had life to offer him the blind man who was already dead to a art
ought he not to greet his set an end as a boom from the mortals
did it not spare him a humiliation is great and painful as could be imagined
whatever might await him he desired o better fate
if he had passed into annihilation he h bon wish to follow him thither an annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
but if he were destined to meet his fertil and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not to tell them hows sure he was a finding a joyful reception there from both
the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was n nemesis no it was a kindly deity
y it was no allusion that deceived him
again he heard the beloved voice and this time in addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
sometimes what the touching entreaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
b lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philips her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
cried hermon and grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and follow the soldier whom the captain detail to guide her into the palace
to morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to the dangerous path
ding again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philippa silenced tar with the grave exclamation the odo of the king
as soon as the captive artist was alone with a woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forth incoherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly returned the pressure he could not restrain the desire to class perch was heart
in spite of his deep mal distress he could have shouted aloud in this slighting gratitude
he might now have been permitted to find forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest dang but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the poles of the following morning still sealed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought not to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impulse exclaimed you know that i love you
i've love you and have loved you always
damn exclaimed tenderly what more its needed
but hermon with hooping head murmured to morrow i shall no longer be what i am now
then that hew raised her face to his asking so the demeanors the worker myrtles
put a terrible or deal again awaits you
and i full plied also mind could be vexed with you for it
bring this before your mind and everything else you must except with it if you consent with a time arrives to become conceal in pali nothing
so our ki intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day
he himself on the way to exposed himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
his heart contracted painfully it is solicitude about his uncle's fate increased when philips and warmed him that the conspirators had been rested at the banquet and headed by amin the rhodium crisp and proces had perished by the executioner sword at sun eyes
besides he knew that the objective his love would not part from him without granting can one mast word
on the way his hard dropped almost to burst it
even after in's image and what threatened her fathers and her with him was seated far into the background
he was appearing before his companions only to give truth it's just do
the egyptian obey and his master crossed the wide space strewn with sand and approach the stage which had been erected for the feast o performances even had his eyes retained the power of sight his bud was coursing soil wildly through his vans that he might perhaps have been unable to distinguish the statues rat him and the thousands of spectators who quota cosy together richly garlanded their ce slowing with enthusiasm surrounded the arena hermon
shouted his friend silas and joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk hermon
even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeter he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become fates whose art and his nature
honor to mirus and his art but he trusted the snowball feast assemblage would pardon the unintentional deceptions and a his prayer for recovery

and having put himself in a fairway has it hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darcy case colonel ashley went down to police head quarters to learned more facts in the connection with the murder of the east indian
picks and down of habit they carroll y up
gle was too much engaged and watching the blue smoke girl lazily upward on his cigar jess then to say more
are you going to work o that case colonel
but he hadn't any more to do with it colonel be that cat
perhaps not admitted colonel ashley
we've got our man and that's all we w
you're on the darcy case they tell mein a way yes
i marking in the interest of the young man
it's just one of them coined into like
must it his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair
gad explained the colonel
the very pair i was going to buy
look here curl do you know anything about this
and the detectives professional w instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
i happen to see those candles ticks in the windows of single fons shop the other day and i made up my mind to buy them when i added chance
now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happened
thought i don't know whether that's his first her his last name anyhow he had apter named sheerly
anyhow he infected get long very well its seems
neighbour's often heard him scrap in lot and his afternoon they went at it again the hot and heavy
toward dark a man went into buy lamb
you found the place without light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was all e's body with they hadad busted in and this heavy candles stick near it
sure held so tight we could hard to get it out
maybe the fight was about who on the watch for the dags talked in their foreign lo and none of the neighbours to tell what they were saint i see
and the watch have you it ye tar
that's the watch announced the head quarters detective reaching in for it going y see
you're not a screams is all that are you just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's
a done of his voice was plainly sceptical
yes been have some rough ages on it
and i rad enough about germs know the danger i'd advise you to be careful
if you don't mind i should like to examine this a bit
before the big winded ireland said just thong with the nodded as irish compatriot slightly toll have the colonel
that's r agreed the colonel as it continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
and a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the time piece but poked it about and touched it here and there were the end of a led pencil
and damon take her friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it
has the surprised detective yes
don't scratch yourself on it whatever you do why not
simply because this watch
someone out her to see you
all i me in a second
send af fut was the panting answer
i wanted talk over darcy's case with you the colonel had said and the two had talked had thought had talked again and now silent for a time
what are the church's of getting him off legally if we gol lighted from a negative standpoint asked the colonel
rather a hypothetical questioned colonel but i should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition
had best he would get off with the scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn't wanton that nor do i
and you i to wanted either
but i want to know just where we stand now i know
but i needed to do a little more smoking out first now i w to think
if you'll excuse me i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may kit something
in fact i have a feeling dia land my fish
i'd recommend him to you instead of blackstone thanks lapped kenneth
what is it perhaps i can hep you
you old adage of two head jen know
yes it' still holds good
no alimony replied the colonel puzzled yes just that
and there's no reason you should know
chuckled the colonel as he skilfully played the luckless trow now struggling to get loose from the hook
and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip in now limp fish into the creels to gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
the reasons she asked no alimony inquired kenneth
no i wasn't thinking of that
however go think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough fort d
well i don't know that you can
it isn't generly known went on the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him
it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of a baser sort
you don't mean that large struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did
the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him
air grafton statement was being unexpected greate
he remembered that cynthia and grafton had once been in love with each other
she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer
because large made no defence
large by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
so i had to letter have way and reed last the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counself feet
no but he well or i'll se and get judgment oh he'll pay all right
and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up
still i would like to know
the murder of missus darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young julia was tried
it had a double reputation so to speak
grave and evened reverend the conventions assembled in its ball room and politicians of the upper if not better class were frigate seen in its dining room or cafe
large himself was a peculiar characters
in a smaller place he would have been called a saloon keeper
and it was this man richard over said and some certainly that sent the a wretch fat had married
to this was the answer whispered money
and in away was true
she also sid opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges
after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the larch hotel it could hard to be called a home became the scene of many fest div occasions
then it was said of large that sho after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat his wife for the refined cruelty that hidden away from the publick underneath his habitual matter there was the wrongness of the brute
but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families for less of on represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smirched are who had not yet acquired any and were rolling to take a chance
it wouldn't do you know after to that story came out for me in the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be see there kenneth explained to the colonel
meanwhile colone lashly was a very ivery busy man to no one did he tell very much about his activities he saw darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something to be done always returned the answer
don't worry it will come out all right
i'm going to d rectify them but it will take time
it's hard from his mace and two although shes bearing up like a major
so king got bale who putt it up
it was h a larch
they took harry away while ago
but he is a pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same
only that i darcy hesitated and grew red
good evening colonel he called genially will you drawin me in a wells rabbit
thanke you no

now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder
the stopped clocks for instance have you any theory
there were three of them the centre figure being gone of harry king and he was veryain much intoxicated
that is not always but sometimes it happened to be so now
i beg your pardon he said in the contry tones he knew so well how to use yet of which he made so little use of late
i said where have you been remarked g other we've missed you
i said i was galling he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort

because their friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
there was a rattle of coins on the mahogany bars king sought to disentangle a single bill from the water up currency in his pocket
it's it's an odd coining an old roman one that missus darcy had an bri collection kept in the jeer store safe was the whispered answer
i went over them ne of the day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i pay a visited to her just a short time before she was kilt
that was hers went on the jew

then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag and with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pebbles
to these he committed me commanding me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how together that he may get his daily bread and you will earn your reward and recompense in
now sleeping under these trees were many apes which when they saw us rose and fled from us and swarmed up among the branches whereupon my companions began to pell them with what they had in their bags and the apes fell to plucking of the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk
we weighed anchor and shahrazad proceed to the dawn of the day and ceased say o permitted say

after which i returned to my old merry way of life and for goot all hi had suffered in the great prophet and gain i had made
next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawn prayer and after blessing ma hummed the cream of all creatures betook himself to the house of sinbad the seamen and wished him a good day
here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales therein
happily mongst he was one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up and all th everything on board of her were plunged into the sea
but at burneth in their bellies so they cast it up again and it congeal on the surface of the water whereby its color and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it ashore and the travellers and merchants who know it collected and sell
each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides and after little the rest of my fellows perished one by one till i had buried the last of the party and a bode alone on the island with buttle little provision left i who was won to have so much
but there is majesty and there is no might sa in hour the glorious the great
when it was the five hundred and sixty first not
then signed for myself i set to work collecting a number of pieces of chinese and calmer and allows wood and i bound them together with robes from the wreckage then i chose out from the broken up ships straight planks of evened size and fixed them firmly upon the e lowes wood making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel of the stream and i tied it tightly and firmly as though it were nailed
land after land shalt thou see and find but no other life on thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul and thy thoughts a night al bo shall end or sooner or late
i rode my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried with the raft with it down the underground channel
and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft by reasoner of the narrowness of the channel whilst the stream ceased not to carry me along knowing not knight from day for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me about and my terror and concerned for myself less i should perish
when i awoke at last i found myself in the light of heavens and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft maud to an island in the midst of a number of indians and a basins
but i was delighted at my escape from the river
when they saw i understood the knight and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace be with thee o my brothers
on my brother answered he we a husbandman untill us of the soil who came out to water our fields in plantations and finding thee asleep on this raft laid hold of it and made it fast by us against thou shouldest awake at thy leisure
i answered for lad's sake and my lord ere i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after asked me what thou wilt
when it was the five hundred and sixty second night
she said at had the reached me our auspicious king that sinbad the seamen continued when o landed and found myself amongst the indians and abyssinian and had taken some rest they consulted among themselves and said to one another there is no help for it but we carry him with us and present him to our king that he may acquaint him with his adventures
so i consorted with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respects
so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing to set out with a merchants for that i pined after my people and mine own land
quoth he thou art thine own master yet if it be thy willed to abide with us on her head eyes be it for thou gladdens with thy company
by allah are my lord answered i thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with thy favours and well doings but i weary for a aside of my friends and family a native country
then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchants ef said
he asked me whence they came and i said to him by allah a commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way thither
for state processions are throne is set for him upon a huge elephant eleven cubits high and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks on his right hand and on his left
his letter h shown me this and as for the mightiness of his dominions thou hast told us what they are hast dy witnessed
presently my friends came to me in i distributed presence among my family and gave arms and largess after which i yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment mirth and merry making and forgot or but i had suffered
such then i my brothers is the history of what befell me in m sixth the voyage and to morrow in shall
i will tell you the story of my seventh and last forage which is still more wondrous and marvellous than that of the first seeks
when it was the five hundred and sixty third knight
she said at hath reached me our auspicious king that when sinbad the seamen had related the history of what befell him in his sixth the voyage and all the company had dispersed sin bad the landsmen went home and slept as of want
the seventh voyage of sinbad the same
no o company that after my returned from my sixth the voyage which brought me abundant profit i resumed my former life and all possible joyance and enjoyment and mirth and making mary day and night and i tarried some time in this solace and satisfaction till my soul began once more to long to sail the seas and sea foreign countries and company with merchants and here nee things
so having made up my mind are packed up in bales a quantity of precious stuffs suited for sea trade and repaired with them from bagdad city to baser town where i found a ship ready for sea and in her a company of considerable merchants
but the captain arose and tying in his girdle tucked up his skirts and after taken refuge with alla from satan the stoned climbed to the masthead whence he looked out right and left and gazing at the passengers and crew fell to buffet in his face and plucking out his beard

lady earnest and peg and catt hiss mothers moved in circles which were entirely bend their compass or ambitions and the sun would probably one day be an ambassador
hasp and wife looked blankly and desperately at another
it was missus peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there are thieves in the house we k the drawing room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while wear at breakfast
she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room not be stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later bearing a queen jug in her hands
the pigeon coats had turned peter than ever missus peter had a final inspiration
pitter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lived so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed within measurable
missus peter turned to her guest with confidential kindness

then as arch stood in the dark literally a gasped with astonishment he read the faint rustling once more and again all with sent
he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full e vexation en gin da proper as the prince caller love of our own dignity of which arca bra stroke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british or officer had a pretty good stuck
and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
col mor came on this idea directly as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
for it suddenly curd to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a veryain reckless sit of people who was stoppin nothing
no he thought to himself i don't believe there would kill me but they would not me about
the kick he had received was a fore taste of what he might expects and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter quickly as he could
to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest point and signal for help moss boats crewe roy searching for him how to escape
but w know was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them ms they fitted into the stone so
next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old fashioned marble mantel piece fireplace chimney
yes if otherways failed he could escape up the chimney
no that was too bad he couldn do that
sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hose were completely gone now and he said his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot f ever thinking about such people
a narrow table against the wall in two places
he went and tried to force his head through were calling as he did that where persons head would go the rest of the bother would pass
but there was no chance for his body there that had would not go first
a fellow who was should up in prison for life may do it he said but not li case like this

what a queer dream weil to himself
and how queer for mister girl to be talking like that to andrew teal the boy who helped the cook
and why did any co mister girl father
there was an interval of thinking over this nighty questioned during which the lowe whistling went on
and i lob too tell i was upper suppose
no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint miss hung like reads of smoke
what did they say false alarm till sir is then they would clear o eight night seene if anything had been left about lobster wrote
once out of that room he could ran and by daylight the smugglers d not hunt him down
oh those bars he ment they exclaimed and he was advancing towards them we just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the windows a couple of hands seized the bars there was is a scratching of bootes against work and rams face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young mysian instead
r was the first to recover from his surprise

art stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
he has gone to give the alarmed what the prisoner and he looked excitedly round for a way escape
nothing but the chinee presented itself
a happy inspiration and come and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out at his little curved dirk glanced at the edge ran to the window and began to cut it one of the bars labor in vain
he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realised that the attemper madness
the re was not veryain satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear selling sound as he founded now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
but at the end of five minutes stopped and for us back the dirk into a sheath
no he can't part with that father left the boy daringly

almost at this instant i heard of pistol shot in the bank
chat weel woods and jim wode up and joins shouting to the people in the street to get in side and firing their pistols too emphasizes their commands
if any of our party shot him it must have been woods
meantime the street was getting un comfortably hot
every time i saw any one with a bead on me i will drop off my horse and trow to drive the sheer inside but i could not see in every direction
doctor wheeler who had gone upstairs in the hotel shot miller and he lay dying in the street
changing his pistol to his left hand bob ran out and mounted miller's mayor

in chair of lisp ands order not to sheet was the beginning other protectorate that minnesota people established over us
captain murdock
but mars port had flourished enough to kill it off
some of mars laws dated from the time when lawn force ment had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
the stonewall gang numbered perhaps five hundreds
even dare lex and failures had to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which e out some kind of a marginal living
they were safe from protection rackets there none bothered to come soir far out
the shop keepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earths
captain murdock was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
the pressure was enough to get them for him
gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
i've got a free hand and we're going to run this the way we would on earths
your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like or not no graft
the first man making a shake down will get the same treatment were goin to use on the stone roll boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
he picked up out five of the men including gordon you five will come with me
the rest of you can teem up anyway you want tonight pick any rout that open th came lust go
bruce gordon grins slowly as he swung the stick and murdoch's eyes fell on him earth cop
two years gordon admitted
for a second gordon cursed himself
he began wandering about security then
nobody had tried to get and touch with him
there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim fs for bab glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
moving in two groups of threes that opposite sides of the street they began their beat
there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lack of air
gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands
corn's eyes popped at that
he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
the other four copse had come in reluctantly
he brought him to the ground with a single blows crossed the kidneys
they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cup started off
to find ef fir and call the wagon
were not using wagons murdock told him line them up
if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were clubbed carefully
murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulder shaking and tears running down his cheeks
the captain's face was a sick as gordons felt
i want the name of everye man and the gang ye can remember he tolde the me
colonel they' kill me i don't know
murdo took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tufts
if he could turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
trouble began brewing shortly after though
murdock sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
and the third one bu scorn spotted one of the men had been beaten before
get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs hew
but the captains stirred finally sighing
now the cops are giving me were covered gordon
but the stonewall gang is backing wain
but is s going to be tough on them
bed gordon grimmest i've got a yellow ticket from security
mok blanked he dropped his ey slowly
what maes you think wain will be re elected
nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
ever see a martian election
no your firste he can't lose
and then hell is going to po and this whole plan may bey blown w open
it fitted with the dia predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
he was getting evening fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair rest r around the corner
cost a more but they be respectable
because i he is always honest according to have he sees it
but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
the groups grew more experienced and murdock was tray a new squad every night
it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
this cood lead to abuses as he'd seen on earths
but there probably wouldn't be time for if mayor wane was re elected
it was night outside and the pos fore bobs at the corners clod dimly giving him barely enough light by which de locate the way to the extemporized precinct house
it had probably been years since any had dared wrist get after the sun went down
and the slowed doubtful respected on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that hay system was working
gordon hit the signal switch and the mar speaker let out a shrill whistle
gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
you can't do it to me a
i'm reformed i'm going street
ye damned cops can't oi was blubbering
one look was enough the work papers had the tell tale over thickening of the signature they had showed up on other papers obvious lay forgeries
some turned away as gorden and other cop went to work but most of them mt squeamish
when it was over the two picked up their whimpering captive
chinks the other cop had been holding the wallet
must have been making a big contact and something fifty fifty
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
when gordon and jenkins came back murdo tossed the money to them split it
whatever comes to him governor
like this serial call a gordon asked him
the little man shook his head his ancients eighteen year old face turning sober note
you are me some bell's govern
eleven hundreds fifty credits
you didn't pay up your pledge to the captain fond so i had to fill
a thousand interest at ten percent a week standard right
gordon had heard of the friendly interest charge on side here but he shook his head wrong is he
hah is he turned it over and shook his head
now show me where i signed an the agreement saying i'd pay you back
first second i he's face went blank then he chuckled
he poured out the bills and handed them over
thanks is he thanked yourself
the kid pocketed the money cheerfully noding
the little guy new mars as few others did apparently from all sides
and if any of the other cops had private rackets of their own i he was undoubtedly the man to find it out and used the information with a beat such as that even going hales and with all the graft too the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped unto the bench
go on except dem
there was a mean coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
the little publishers was back at the crusader again
only gordon and clo were left
credit had been established again and the business were open
gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwelling s built like the dome but opaque for privacy
they have been lucky
show bird's volunteers were official now
fats place was still opened though the crooked at tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
he reached automatically for the class of heather needle beer
thought ye'd be in the chips
that's mars gore ack her other's comment why don't you pull off the plan fats you could go back to earth i'd guess father noted
guessing me gets us to anything hell maybe i can hi some bum to sit around and whoop it up from the ships come in and bi this as a real old martian dan of sin
there was a grin on the others face
finally got out a orders for you it's mercury
we sat swing others a same way and they failed
lets save you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
you can't stay here
there's a rocket waiting to trans ship you to the man on the way to mercury wright now gordon side
and i paid her the pay we are you from the tiny begin use in your badge she's ups shopping
but his old eyes were glinting
did you think we'd let you go without singing off cover he asked
ay i oh dad it i'm getting old ez you tell him
he grabbed gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank is hey shook his head
any colchester had begun to make pins with lizzy
lastly determined to tri upon us an english language and literature
