there's iron they say in all our bloods and a gran or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
margaret said mister hale as he returned from showing his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thornton made his confession of having been a shopboy
you don't mean that you thought me so silly
i really like that account of himself better than anything else he said
his statement of having been a shopboy was the thing are like best of wall
you who are always accusing people of being shoppy at helstone
i don't think mister hale you have done quite right int introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some part of what he said
his father dying in miserable circumstances
why it might have been in the workhouse
his fathers speculated wildly failed and then kill himself because he could not better disgrace
all his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
no one came forwards to help the mother and this boy
at least no friend came forwards immediately and mis thornton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
so they lift milton
how tainted asked her father
op paa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked up upon them only as new ways of extending trade in making money
and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his ar nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
not vicious he never said that
improvident and self indulgent were his words
margaret was collecting her mother's working the tals and preparing to go to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
however out it came
paa i do think mister thornton a very remarkable man but purse me i don't like him at all
wh i do said her father laughing
first me as y call it and all
i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
but good night child
there was several other science of something wrong about missus hale
she and dixon held mysterious consultations in a bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was a custom when any distress of her mistress called upon her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chambers soon after dixon lifted and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
but though she received presses and from words back again in touch profusion as would have gladden her formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
she lay wet very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
a servant give dixon permanent assistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mothers might have all the personal attentions she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
visiting register officers seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she met bessy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
well busy how are you
better and not better if you know what that means
not exactly replied margaret smiling
i better in not being torn to pieces by coughing or nights but i'm weary and tide or milton and longing to get away to the lo boola and when i think i'm farther and farther off my heart sinks none no better i'm worse
margaret turned round to walk gong side of the girl in her feeble progress homewards
but for a minute or two she did not speak
at last she said in a low voice
busy jewish to die
bessie was silent in her turn from a minute or two then she replied
not worse than many others are reckon
but what was it
you know i'm a stranger here s perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton
i had forgotten when i said for the time coned margaret quietly
i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
the sharp us in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
as they turned up into a small court opening out into a scold street bessy said
you will not be daunted de fathers at home and speaks a bit graf fish at first
but nicholas was not at home when they entered
past bessie at last
busy took a long and feverish draught and then fell back and shut her eyes
margaret bento grew and said bessy don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or they have been
remember who gave it to you and made it what it is
now i'll not have my wench preached to
but surely said margaret facing round ye believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of laugh it was to be
i believe wh sey and nemo
that's what i believe young woman
i don't believe all i hear no not by big deal
but whose come at last and whose welcome as long as who will keep from preaching on what who knows not about
its simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work
but the gol and you plated the moor was margaret
turpin hardly on him is a good man ease
i sometimes think i shall be murk with sorrow evening the city of god if other is not there
the feverish collar came into a cheeks and the feverish flame into a her eye
but you'll be the father ye shall oh my hot
she put her hand to it and became ghastly pale
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
presently the spasm that foreshadowed death had passed away and this he roused her soft and said
i'll go to bed it's best place but catching that margaret's gown y're come again i know you will but just say it
oh come to morrow said margaret
margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
she was late for tea at home

everybody also had they turned up his great difficulty now let me try
i may be the sindri la to putt on the slipper after all
what would you do papa i would you set about him
why i would apply to some good house mother to a commend me one known to herself or servers
very good but we must first catch her house mother
the mother of him in spoke to us said margaret
mister thornton the only mother he has i believe said mister hale quietly
i shall like to see her she must be an uncommon person her mother added
perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
she sounded to be such careful economical person that i should like any one out of the same family
my dear said mister hale will armed o don't go of on that idea
i'm sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
take notice that this is not my kind of fortunes papa if i have any at all which are inn agree to or you always accusing me of it
i don't know positively that it is her either but from little things i've gathered from him a fancy sir

dicky was well of questions but mister be at no answers were them
nor was it sunday on which they took a rest and rushed their shirts according to mister bat's rule of life
they did not stay there but walked out across the dance with the sky lacs were singing and on a dip of the dance came upon great stone wards and towers for strong and grey
what's that there said dy
replied he of a truth i heard him not and i wot him not and folks are all sleeping
but she said whomsoever thou seest awake he's the reciter
then said the eunuch art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him
rejoined the eunuch who then was the reciter point him out to me
by allah replied the fireman i tell thee the truth
tell me what happened whats allah makan
what ails thee then that thou must needs reside verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
and he os improvised the two following this stitch
when nat al zaman heard the first improvisation she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their will home then she wept and cried to the eunuch and said to him wo to thee
he who recited the first time hath recited the second dime and i heard him hard by
by allah and thou fatch him not to me i will assuredly roused the chamberlain on thee and yee shall beat thee and cast thee y out
but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bringing him to me gently and do him no hurt
returned quickly and linger not
when it was the seventy third nine
but the yok said i will not leave thee tilt thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returning into my lady without him
now when the fireman heard these words he feared for zau makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch by allah it was not i and they know him not
so go thou to thy station and if thou again meet anyone after this hour reciting aught of p trey whether he be near or far it will be i or someone i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me
then he kiss'd the oo's head and spake him fair till he went away but a castrato fetched around and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
i say what made my ignominy what have the beater cup i drain far be from me thy land to flea nor will i bow to those who blame and for such law would deal me shame
then said the eunuch to z ala machan bees we would bee o my lord
o my lord continued the eunuch and shahrazad perceived that the dawn of day and seized to say her permitted say
we will do yee know arid o my son nor wrong thee in aught but our objects is that thou bent thy gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and returning wheel and safety and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news
then the eunuch went out to zu machan and said to him reside what verses thou knowest for my ladies here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask yee of thy name and thy native country and thy conditions
and also these
then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit
when the eunuch saw these case he wandered that them and throwing over then somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
after awhile they came to themselves and whose al zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression laft her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the kan and what had happened to her with the bai how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother shar can and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of b how he had made their marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the king their sire had sent and asked for her from sharpen
but now go to thy master and break him quickly to me
the chamberlain called castrato and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i here and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the talker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girding his ass and preparing for flight
she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the talker girted his ass for flight and bespake himself saying oh would i knew what is become of him
i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence these pages at about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime
why didst thou say i never repeated these couplets nor d do i know who debated them when it was it thy companion
but now i will not leave yee between these place and that doubt and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee
was as i feared the commingles discerning but on to allah we are all returning
then the eunuch cried upon you the pages saying take him off the ass
and he answered i the chamberlain of the emir of damascus king sharpen sang over mar bin al l woman lo bagdad and of the land of kor san and a bringing tribute and presence from him to his fathering bagdad
so fairy forwards no harm shall befall you till you join he grand wa ear than done
then he bad him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was trembling to the emir of damascus and was bound to king har with presence and the tribute of syria
so it was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the king's son sharpen and may came sultan over his father's rail
and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet zaza machan for quoth they his name be light of the place and he hath a sister news hart al zaman hies the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for al he jah and none wotteth what is become of them
so he turned to the wazir of dan and said to him viti your tale is a wonder of wonders
no o chief wazir that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bring us you your desire after the easiest of fashions for let his almighty will restore to you zahm kan and his sister nat al zaman whereby we will settle the matter as be easily can
when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the twain and what befell them and the cause of their long absence
zaman bowed his hadad awhile and then said i accept the position p indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and sat him on the right way
then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother shark
after a while the dust dispersed and there appeared under the army of bagdad and khorasan a conquering host like the pool tide sea and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
when it was the savant y eighth night
any neat all rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place
lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zau machan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and sires sun speer
moreover the sultan commanded his wazirs undone call at ten days halted of the army that he might be private with him and learned from him how and wherefore his father had been slain
he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days

they swarmed up and front a serbs palings as thick as they could jam together and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise
some sung out peer down the fence tear down the fence
the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
scherbinin run his eye slow along the crowd and where ever its struck the people tried a little de out gaze em but they couldn't they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
the average man's a coward
because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back in the dark and its just what they would do
so they always a quit and then a man goes in the night with a hundreds ms cowards at his back and lunches the rascal
you didn't wanted to come
but a mob without any man at the head of it his beneath pitifulness
now lead and take your half a man with you tals he is gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this

he can't beat keep careful
a argue an ty to keep him out but he wouldn't listen an a hole show come to a his stan still
and one or two women begin to scream
so then the ring master he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could s stay on the horse
it warn't funny to me though i was all but tremble to see his danger
and the horse a going like a house afire too
he shed him so thick they kind of cloud up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits
why it was one of his own min
an but never mind arst of his outfit it was jest white but it was awful funny

what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up an sell the rest of the town

we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
we never show de alight till we was about ten mile below the village
green horns flat heads

well they all do jim
now d d he's a tolerable like of man in some ways
this one's a middlin hard lot for a duke
when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and morning to himself
it don't seem natural but i reckon it so
he was often moor and mourning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying ho little elizabeth's
donn you hear me shut dad do
i lay i make you mine
jest as loud as i could yell
which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to howl
the canes duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy
why before he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when he'd take off his new white beavers an make a bow an do a smile he looked that grand and good an pious that you'd say he'd walk right out of the ark and maybee was o of vice himself
jim cleaned up the canoe an i got my pier ready
were you bounty young man
get aboard says the king
i had done so an then we all three started on again
the young chat was mighty thankful said he was tough work toting his baggage such weather
p asked the king where he was going and the king told him he'd come down to river and landed at the other village this mornin and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there the young fellow says
but then i says again no i reckon it ain't him or else he wouldn't be paddling up the rib you ain't him are you
no my name's oblige it alexander obliging reverend alexandr oblige it i s'pose i must say as i warned the lars poor servants
you see he was pretty old and george's goody earls was too younger be much company for except mary jane the red hitting and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didn't seem to care much to l

when her deep they won't stop for a hail
was peter wilts well off
when we struck the boat she was a bout done loading and pretty soon she got all
now hustle back right off an fetch the duke c here and the new carpet bags
so then they waited for a steamboat
but the king was caled he says
they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would d tell you
they wanted them says kind o soften gentle
phelps as one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look alike
i wait around a climb over the back stile by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen
i outward a yes'm for i thought
so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
when we got there she set me down in a split bottom chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
well it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt
an i think he died afterwards he was a baptist
yes it was mortification that was it
your uncle's bin up to the town everyday to fetch you
you must met him on the road didn't you agis man with a
whit child it'll be stow
it was kinder thin eyes but i says
i had my mind on the children o a time i wanted to git them out to one side and pumped them a little de fin out who i was
pretty soon she made the cold chill streak all down my bac because she says
i see it warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
so i says to myself here is another place where i got to rest the truth
i opened my mouth to begin but she grab me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes
children don't you say a word
i see i was in a fixed now
missus felt she jumped for him and says
hes he come no says herr husband
i can't imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy
uneasy she says i'm ready to go distracted
he must a come and you've missed him along a road
oh don't distress me any more n already distressed
why silas look yer up the road aint thats somebody comin
the old gentleman stared and says
i hain't no i dare who is it
is tom sawyer
being time sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stay easy and comfortable till by by i hear steamboat coffin along down the river
then i says to myself s'pose time sol comes dan on ned boat
but i am h please that you have seen my lady
i knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
her conversations has more charms and can be in mere beauty and a humor and disposition would make a deformed person appear lovely
why didn't you not send me that mews and a garland
why the best on it i have a squire na that is as good as in night
ernest we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish and occasioned as i cannot tell which is strangers
all the people that i had ever and my life refused were brought again upon the stage like richard the third's ghosts to reproach meal and all the kindness discoveries could make i had for you was late to my charge
my best qualities if i have any that are good served but for aggravations of my fault and i was allowed to have wit and understanding a discretion and others things that it might appear i had none in this
tis a strange change and i'm very sorry for it but i'll swearing or not how to help it
mister fish is a squire of things and has so many mistresses than anybody may pretender share in him and re believed that though i have the honor to be his near neighbor to speak freely i cannot brag much that he mak sing e court to me and i know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often
i think my youngest brother comes down with him
i can no sooner give you some little hints where about they live but you know them presently anent you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if i incline him to loo graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
i have missed four fits and i had but five and have recovered so much strength as may be venture to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
but besides i can give you others
i am here much more out of people's way than in town for my aunts in such has pretend and interest in me in a power over me do so persecute me lent dear good nature n take it so ill that they are not accepted as i would live in a hor tree to avoid them
you'll think him altered and if it be possible more melancholy than he was
if marriage agrees n better with other people than it thus with him i shall pray that all my friends may escape it
well in earnest if i were prince that lady should be my mistress but i can give no rule to anyone else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing their hearts to her may be infinitely taken with one i should not value at all all ful so a justinian wise providence has ordained it that by dead different humours everybody might find something to please them stoves wal without envying their neighbors
the matters is not gray for i confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best pleased never to be known in it won any occasions whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly avoided one must satisfy oneself by doing nothing that one needed care knows
if i had a picture that were fit for you he should have it
how king it talk of the flying fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine it you could
i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am certain he knows y utmost of the injuries you have received from her
we have had another to beat but much more calm me
then besides there was a time when we are soles when different to one another did i do so then or have i learned it since
i have been studying how tom cheek might come by his intelligence and i very believe he has it from my cousin peters
how kindly do i take the civilities of your fathers in earnest you cannot imagine how is let appease me
would it would leave me and then i could believe i shall not always avocation for it
by poor lady vavasor is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against a protector and did not discover it
she has told now all that was told her but vows she will never say from whence she a it we shall see whether her resolutions ars unalterable as those of my lady talmash
i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
i never saw anyone yet that did not look siny and out of countenance nor ever knew a wedding well designed but won and that was of two persons had time enough i confess to contrive it and nobody to pleas invent themselves
the truth is i could not endure to be missus bride in a publick wedding we made the happiest person on earth
do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather than fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
yet in earnest your father will not find my brother paid and wanting and civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters in me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set a higher value upon her sister and she deserves
my aunt told me no longer garden yesterday that i was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome to ked
you see i give you fell warning
by the next i shall be gone into kent in my other journeys laid aside which i am not displeased at because it would have broken o inter course very much
here are some blas is a colonies tell me all you like them
i told you in my last that my suff willed journey was lad aside and i into kant hastened
if i drown by the way this will be my last letter n like a will i bequeath all my kindness to you in it for a charge never to bestow it all upon another mistress lest my ghost rise again and haunted you
indeed i like him extremely and he is commended to me by people that know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than they i did not intend it so that i can assure you
i do not find her i am told i was so extremely when i believed you love me
but i am called upon
directed for your master
i see you can chin when you please and with authority but i deserve i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded for a very good principle in me
we dare not that our tongues lie more on one side of our mass and the other for fear of overturning it
you are satisfied i hope and this than i scape drowning
but i am troubled much you should make so ill a journey to saw little purpose indeed i writ by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters
oh well go you will be but alas
for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to no decay an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission
they laughed to hear me say that one unkind wor destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase everyday if it were possible but never lessen
we go broad all thee and play all night and see our praise when we get time
wh in sober earnest now i would not live us a twelvemonths to gain all that kan has lost unless it were to give it him again
will you be so good nature
he has one son it isis to finest boy that e saw and has a noble spirit but yet stands in that all of his father at one word from him is as much as twenty whippings
you must give me leave to entertain you else with discuss of the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
not to knowing you would come home i can assure you nor for any other cat on my own but with a cousin of my that had long designed to make herself spot with him and did not miss of her aim
in my life i never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for which could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
ever since this adventure i have had some greater belief in all things for this nature that i could not forbear laying a pease cot with nine piece int under my door yesterday and was informed by it that my husband's name should be thomas how do you like that
she put her hair down turned his good back put her feet on the fender and took patter into her lap all of which arrangements syne faced that something very important had got to be thought over and souled
the more propos was the mo credit
af tight it unlight it and maybee d s the consequence of that night's fun
just suppose it is true that he does ask me and rayes
what a spiteful thing i am
i did do so much for au at home how i should inside that
that m see how can i begin
he has known her all her life and has a good influence over her
now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that weak for when the first excitement of the dodging reformed had subsided she missed the blessed little in the views that used to put a certain flavor of romans into her thar hot working days
i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or positions that knows attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected
it was that indescribable something which women are quick to see in feeling men who have been pressed that wes and good mothers
this had an especial charmed to polly for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to everyone
lately this had changed especially towards parley and it filled her more than she would confess even to herself
at first she tried to think she could that unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even certitude
polly felt a very cordial friendship for mister sydney but not one particle of the lear they the only kind in which laugh can be tully paid
this finished polly's indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl that the spies of the old eve in her composition
when set a d came polly startled as usurers it to back hey and best but goodness resist stopping at the shores to leave pass of a fen that was calling time
a foolish little speech to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tender heed girl trying to her duty
take hold of massa charley's hand miss mae and what pretty like willie and flossie said the mate
at the street corner a black eyed school poy was parting from a rosy face school girl whose music w he was reluctantly sir andre
how he got there was never very clear to pony but there he was flushed and a little out of path but looking so glad to see her till she had not the heard to biff and core as she had fully intended to be when they meant
chiny could not help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
that is the way i gate the worse answered polly
she did not mean to tell but as fright this was so agreeable she forgot herself
but i knowe her better and i assure you that she does improve she choice to mend her thoughts though she won't own it and who suppress you some day by the amount of heart and sense and goodness she has got
thank you no
h lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
asked the out for young man laying a trap into which polly immediately fell
he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being booted browed and generous re off to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as pace his own
so when you made a last poy and remark he said quietly watching your face keenly all the wire i thought so well i'm going out of town on business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me anny it
she thought she had a good deal of the coquet in her and i've no doubt that with time and training she would have become a very dangerous from person but now she was fart to transparent and straight forwards by nature even to tell a white like lovely
he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with the remorse for face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only love or she would ever have had read his answer and accepted it in servants
parley did not return to her favor walk till she learned for minnie that uncle had rally left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the ways a pleasant
lugging too and four as usual what the news with you
perhaps shell shill him
utterly done with and laid upon the shelf
minnie said the other days she wished she was a pitch and so she could paddle in the bottles and not fuss above rubles
now don't be affected polly but just tell me like a dea has not he proposed
don't you think he means to
truly july fair
i don't mean to be prying but i really thought he did
oh i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have
i just gave him the hint and he took it
he meant to go away before that so think his heart is broken or mind what city gentler say
he understood and being a chan lumm and made no farce
but parry it would have been a grand thing for you
i not you know and prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days
never mind what the business was it surfaces to say that it was a good beginning for a young men like tom who having been born and bread in the most conservative class of the most conceded city in your england needed just the healthy hardy social influences of the vest to riden his views and make a man of him
fortunately everyone was so busy with the necessary probations that there was no time for romans of any sort and the four young people work together as soberly insensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not butte up in their respective hurts
pity that the ed which had com so soon but the hour did its work and wend its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind but the young folks did not see it them for their eyes within because of the partings that must be
if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a sum u town but sydney often called to his vacation came and the voluminous clo s bonds of poly beguiled belong days
time we at once a weak to his mother but the letters were short in not very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women less liked to hear
no i'm only tired had a good dear so do lately and the dull weather mixes me chest aweer brew
forgive me polly but i can't up saying it for this there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can
a to i not a deceive myself but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me
thank heaven for that
cried polly with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice
poor parley was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say
none were needed her tell her face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish ostrich and the hundreds are after it
once or t eyes but sor of chokingly and i thought it was only some little flirtations
it was just you cood of me not a guess before
it was so tender earnest and defiant but fy forgot the defense of her own lover and admiration of polls loyalty to hers for this faithful or absorbing laugh was a newer relation to fanny who was used to hearing her friends best of two or three love ass a year and calculate their respective fairies with almost as much coolness as the young men discussed fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to mary
i hope maria bailey's only thing sir she added softly for i could not bear to heaven and disappointed again
said fanny turning hopeful all at once
suppose i say a word to tome just inquire after his heart in a general way you know i'm giving a chance to tell me if theres anything to tell
bear it people always to bear thing somehow answered polly looking as if sentence had been passed upon her
it was a very different winder from the last above the girls
if fy wanted to show him what she could do towards making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded b than she suspected for in spite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mister sydney at least for he was more the house friend than ever and seemed determined approve the change of fortune made not difference to him
she kept much at home in the day's work was done finding it pleasant a s streaming of a book or soon alone than to exert herself even to go to the shores
polly was not at all like herself that winder and those news to her saw in wonder added most
for ned was so absorbed in business that he excelled the whole baily question and left them in other darkness
fy came bogged in upon one day looking as if she poured tidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them
but if work baskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any re leaded
she had even been in society before the revolution
it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext
every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monseigneur saint fr sis gave it to m seigneur say julian maso saint julian gave it to monseigneur saint eves m sieur saint you si gave it to monsieur sain procopius et cetera et cetera
and the schoolgirls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under the bales charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers frown
it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
the ruler of font offal did not forbid this
she would not show the subjects anyone
thus that furnished a subject of comment for all those who were on occupied or board in the convent
some unique chaplet sym authentic relic
they lost themselves and conjectures
who the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making and effort to fly but the dancers laughing with a satanic air
moral love conquered by the colic
the priors returned and seated herself once more hon chare
we will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued to the bestest of our ability
father forewent

saint terentius bishop of porte where the mouth of the tyber empties into the sea requested that on his two lightly engraved to the sign which was placed on the graves of parasites in the hope that passers by would spit on his tomb this was done

the dead must be obeyed to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother crucifixion
she asked it of us that is to say commanded us
but it is forbidden
oh i am a stone in your walls

the most ferocious feasts are beasts which are blind
oh how wicked people are
by order of the king signifies to day by order of the revolution
one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead a holy death is prohibited
gauthier bishop of clan held his own in this matter against oho duke of burgundy

general observations on preserves confectionery ices and desert dishes
we expence of preserving them with sugar is a serious subjection for except a sugar is used in considerable qualities the success is very uncertain
fut gathered in what a folly other will sue be mildred and be of no service were preserves
but to distingue sees properly replies very great attention and considerable experience
if you dip the finger into the surf and the plight to the thumb the tenacity of the serve will on separating the finger and thumb afford thread which shortly breaks this is the little thread
read it boil up again then take it off and roved carefully the scum that h risen
it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out alike oil
before sugar was he used honey was employed puce of many vegetable productions though this substance was now hiven layed the juice of the sugar cane
fourteen no dy nine
for the m three day successively stomach time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use
the reason that if further emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
from this example the process of preserving fruits by sur would be easily comprehended
they should be dried in the stove or oven on a seed and turned every six or eight hours fresh powder sugar being sifted over them every time there turned
in this way it is also that orange in woman ships are preserved
marmalades james and fu past of the same nature and are now in the general quest
marls and jams differ little from each other there preserves of half liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits i am sometimes part of the reines was shoulder
but they may keep it h necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen o three
in all the operations for preserved making when the preserving pain is used it should not be placed on the fire but on a tribute on mess a jim is mean on a hot plate when this is not necessary
confectionery fifteen o eight
in speaking of confectionery should be remarked that all the various preparations above named c strictly speaking under that head for the various fruits flowers herb l in juices which one board with sugar were formerly employed in pharmacy as well as sweetmeats were called confections from the latin worth confer say to make up but the term confectionery embraces of very large class indeed of sweet food many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary que
a thousand in one ornamental dishes that had donn the tables of the wealthy should re purchase from the confectioner they cannot profitably be made in home
harbor as late as the reign of our two last george's fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful deserts
the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems
ices
at deserts or at some evening parties ices are scarcely dispensed with
this s battle is generally made of copper kept bright and clean
they should be taken immediately after the past or some hours after because the taking of these substances dinging the process of digestion is apt to revoke indisposition
there was once on the time a widower who had a sudden and the daughter by his first wife
from the very dave at the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the manse children and not a corner to be found what they could get any rest so the boy thought that the best thing he could do was to p out into the world and tried to his own bread
but his sister who was still at home fared wards and worse
tis me go said bad
when the king entred ands he stood still as if he were in fetters and could not stir from the spot for the picture seemed to him so beautiful
lees promise to make all the haste he could and set forth from the tim's palace
at last they came in side of land
while if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her tasking into the sea
what is my brother saying asked his sisters again
on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maid came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchenmaid who slept there to lend her a brush
she begged very prettily and got it and then she bushed her hair and the goal dropped from it
out on the ugly bushy brie sleeping so soft of the young king's side on sand and stones my bed i make and my brothers sleeps with the cold snake unpitied and unwept
i shall come twice more and then never again said she
this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she sent the bell gout three times and when d dawned she departed but if she was going she said as she had said the floor i shall come once more and then never again
no one can tell how the light of the king was to get rid of that hideous bushy bride and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as day itself
wilt thou serve me on what my seven falls as the king
the youth thought that it was fa easy word to was the folds and he could do well enough
hast thou watched faithfully and well the whole day long said the king wh the lad came into his presence in the evening
yes that i h said the youth
he had gone at once to seek a place he said but never would he do such a thing again
the necking promised in the same punishment and the same reward to a fe pish his brother
when he had run after the fools for a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by a clef in the rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with the distant and she called the him
come e there come hither my handsome son and let me comb your hair
the youths liked the thought of this let the holds when were they chose and seated himself in the cleft of the rock by the side of the old hag
so then he sat with his head on her lap taking his ease the live long day
on the third day said the light wanted the sett
the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go but all to no purpose pinder loud set out on his way
i am marking about and so to a place said singe lad
i were much rather have the princess said cinder lad
and thus they journeyed onwards a long long way
when they had gone thus for a long long way be full again us dost thou see anything now

it loos like a chalk of a great thick birch tree
simul had tri but could not do it so he had to take a doff when the pitcher and then one more and after that still another and then he was able to be over sword of perfect ease
for we are brother said of the princess whom nowt to have when now kiss tell the king what we eat and drink but there is a mighty tol who h has to spell over us

once upon a time there was a king in the north hope one many wars but now he was old
the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
so yes the queen how do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning and she said
then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
he is no bigger than other dragon said the tutor and if you were as brave was your father you would not fear him
then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dwarf who warned all the treasure and took it from him
al the one ring was left which the dwarf war and even that was taken from wh
so regan made a sword and cigaret tried it with a blow in a lop of iron and the sword broke
then sigurd went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's play and gave them to regan
so cigaret said that sword would do
then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley
but cigaret waited till half of him it called over the pit and then he thrust the sword graham right unto his very heart
sighed said i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
but all m die and no brave man let's death frighten him from his desire
guy thou fafner and then staff ner died
then sigg g rode back and met rein and riggin asked him to roast fafner hiss heart and let him taste of it
sissy gould put the heart of fafner on a steak and most at it
there's cigaret roasting faton's heart for another when he should taste of it himself and learn all wisdom
that let him do then rid over him fell to the place where brunhild sleeps
there must she sleep till thou comes for her waking rises up and rid for now sure she will swear the vow fearless of breaking
then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper had behold she was a most beautiful lady
then cigaret rode away and he came to the house of the king who had a fair daughter
lamborn hill's father told gunner that she would marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower and that that they rode and gott fit his horse at the flame but he would not face it
for one day when burn heldon goderan were bathing brine held waved farther sou into the river and said she did that to show she was gundo

i swear answered sancho
i say so continued don quixote because i hate taking away anyone's good nee
i say replied sancho that i swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship stayed in gong grat i may be able to let it out tomorrow
though your worship was not so badly having in you acy in comparable beauty you spoke of and i what i have except the heaviest wax that i think i had in all my life
unlucky me in the mott at at bob
didn't i see so worse luck to my line said sancho
it cannot be the more answered don quixote but those under enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone
if they do not leet themselves be seen they let themselves be felt said sancho it not let my shoulder speak to the point
my it speak to said don quixote but that is thought a suspicious reason for believing that what we see as the enchanted more
the officer turned room and said well how goes a good man
sancho got up with pain enough in his bones and went after the inca ber in the dark in meeting the officer who is looking to see what had become of his enemy he said to him senor whoever you are dos the favour and kindness to give us little rosemary oil salt and white for it is water to care one of our bestest knights errand on earth who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted more than is in this in
to be breathe he took the mats of which he made a compound mixing the m boiling them a good while it until it seemed to him they had come to perfection
sancho panza who os regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous begged him to give him what was let in option which was no small quantity
doon quixote cons and he taking it with both hands in good pape and with the better will prop to down and dined a very little lesson his master
if your worship knew that returned sancho won't be time me and all my kindreds why did you let me taste it
search your memory and if you find anything of this kind you needed only tell me of it and i props you by the order knighthood which i have received to procure you satisfaction in reparation to the utmost of your desire
then this isn't in said don quixote
in a very respectable one said the innkeeper
the cries of the poor blanket at wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his master who halting to listen at tented to flea was persuaded that some new adventure was coming until he clearly proceeded that it was his squire who uttered them
he saw him rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that had his rage alum it is my belief he would have lacked
sancho took it and as he was raising int to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming sancho my son drink not water drinkin on my son for it will kill thee see here i had the blessed balsam and he held a pro fas of liquor and with drinking too jobs with thou wilt certainly be restored
the strides of a lame man alike the ogling glances of a one eyed man they do not reach their goal very promptly
cosette had waked up
jean valjean had paced he near the fire
you will wait for me at a lady's house i shall come to fetch y
everything is ranged and nothing is said fauchelevent
i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
that's wear the difficulty lies
it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out
and she will hold her toll me i answer for that
for she yvonne grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean
you understand father madden the goverment were noticed it
je v jan stared him straight toy i and thought that he was raving
fourche lover went on
it is to morrow that i am to bring you in the priors expects you
then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community
that the nun who had dined that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the fault under the altar of the chapel
that the priors and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil wish of the deceased
that he f ah laval was to nail up the coffin in the cell raised the stone in the chapel and lower the corpse into the vaults
and then that there was an ner the empty coffin
what is that anti coffin
asked jee rajah fauchelevent replied
what coffin what administration
fauchelevent who was seated sprang up as though were alma had burst under his chair you
you know for caff what you have said mother crease a fiction is dead
and i add and father madeline is buried a
you are not like other men saw the madeline
this offers the means but give me some informations in the first pace
how long is the coffin six feet
it is a chamber on the ground floor has a grated windows oping on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shatter and two doors one leeds into the convent the other into the church what church
the church in the street of the church which anyone can enter
have you the kings to those two doors
no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the draw which communicates with the tech
only to allow the undertakers men to enter when they come to get the coffin
who nays at the coffin i dy
who spreads the poor labor it
not another man except the police doctor can enter the dad ram that is e written on wall
could you hide me in that ring to night when everyone is asleep
about three o' clock in the afternoon
i shall be hungry ah i will bring you something
you can come and down me up in the coffin at two o'clock
fourche li over recoiled and cracked his finger joins but that is impossible
bah impossible to take a hame and drives nails in a pan
jean valjean had been worse straight the ms
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bail of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to i conies his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean's gloomy talents
you surely must have a gim that you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will m on the top plancon loosely good and what if you should happen to cough or to seize
a man who is making his escape does not cough all sneeze
who is there who is not said to a cat do come in
the over prudent cats as they are and because they are cans sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
but jee valjean's calmer prevailed over him in spite of himself he grumbled
if you are sure of coming out of the coffin right i am sure of getting out of the grave
an u oh of the old school the great digger puts the corpses in the grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
i shall follow that is my business
there's halts the undertake his men not a rope around your coffin firm lower you down
the priests as the prayers makes the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
one of two things will happen he will either be sob all he will not be sober
that is settled father fauchelevent all what go well
on the fallen day as the sun was declining the very rare passers by on the boulevard di men hulled off their hats to an old fashioned hearse ornamented with skulls crass bones and tears
this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a hinge corpse with drooping arms
a morning coach in which could be seen a priest in his circles and a quiet boy in his red cap followed
behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer limped along
the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at might in winter in this cemetery they were subjected to a special discipline
these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalid
dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it
the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the raja han it hinted at poverty places if you pee
to be buried in pars is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognized as elegant
the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the introduction of jean valjean into the deed room all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch let us romantic in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly vial offense in uns
it is one of the faults which resent on a duty
the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences
in the cloister what is called the government is only in intermeddling with authority and interference which is always questionable
make as many nose as you please men but keep them for yourselves
a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind
jee valjean's composure was one of those powerful tranquillity which are contagious
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
he played with father mien
he did what he necked with him he made him dance according to his wind
the permission for interment must be exhibited
he was a sort of labor and map who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a matter under his arm
the man replied the grey digg
the g wave dinna yes
you i
father miss chan the brave digger he was
flush of what had expected anything but this at a grave digger could die
it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do dy themselves
he had hardly the strength to stammer
but he persisted feebly father mess sheer is the grave digger
do you know who lit her fatherland lars he isn't chum of red wine
but you are a jolly va
are you not common well gun have a drink together present
the man replied
he limped more out of anxiety than from infinity
the grave digg walked on in front of him
fauchelevent passed the unexpected cuvier once more in review
fauchelevent who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
the sir father nest tiens dead
the man replied completely
the good gods consulted his notebook which shows when the time is up it was father most un's turn f the mi and died
stammered fauchelevent it is made
you are peasant i on the parisian
fresh she wore thought i am lost
there were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small ary leading to the nun's corner
and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well
fortunately the soil which was light and wett with the winter reins clock of the wheels and retarded its speed
my father was a porter at the bryan m tam home
but he have reverses he had losses on changed i was obliged to renounce the profession of author but i ams still a public writer
but so you are not a grave digger then
returned fauchelevent clutching this branch feeble as it was
here a remark becomes necessary
a flush rev was at his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
the great digg went on with a superiors smile
one must eat
the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake
yes but if i should already ask for something what
well do it for me for i swear to you that don't love you as the others have loved you
there are bolts and the door wretch
i don't know how it is but it's seems to nance if i do
thou go i can't keep my eyes open
it seems to me as if this sweeping city belongs to me i searched my memory for their names of those whose happiness i had on in envied and i could not recall one without finding myself the happier
education fly feeling the says of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are though sims so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first cast of love all the more ardent because they seem so pure
the more girl believes in goodness the more isle will she give way if not to a lover and these to love for be without mistrust she is without force and to would her love as a triumph that can be gained by any young men of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must they find it tempting how surely must be listen to the first voice which comes to tell it secrets through their bars and bless the hand which she is the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil
with them the body has worn out the soul the senses half burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
they love by profession and not by instincts
when a creature who has all her past to report herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere irresistible love of which she had never felt for self capable when she has confessed her love how absolutely the man whom she loves dominates her
they know not to what proof to give
in order to disturb the laborers in the field was one day devoured by a wolfe because those whom he had so often deceived the longer belief in his cries for help
this is the same with these unhappy woman would he love seriously
but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough and soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in shorts he loves as he is loved this man drained at one drought all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
but to return to the first day of my liaison
when i reached home i was in a state of mad gaiety
the woman becomes a man's mistress and loves him
how why
my whole bee was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night
here on my orders tonight at a vade ville
under the third and trap
the boxes filled one after another
only one remained empty a s stage box
at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed opened and marguerite appeared
this she loved me enough to believe that a more beautiful she loos the happier i should be
what is the matter with you to night said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
who should go to bed she replied with that ironic era which went so well with a delicate and witty face
where at home
you still love me can you ask
because she don't like seeing him
then the less i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the county and marvell gain into the carriage which was winging for them at the door
i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
you in the way marguerite but how
well you might have had a woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive
during this remark marguerite looked at me attentively
my dear prudence i answered you do not know what you are saying
yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far ass my door you would want to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
because i am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm
is that really the only reason
if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
on the slye you careful me a little a great feal
i fancied for a moment that i might give myself that happiness for six months you would not have it he insisted annoying the meanes
well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
i listened and i gazed their marguerite would admiration
when i thought that this marvellous creature whose feet i had once long to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts by part in her life and that i was nu yet content with what she gave me i asked if man's desire had indeed limits when s spied as probably his mind had been it reached after something further
truly she continued we poor creatures of chance have fantastic desire and inconceivable loves
we are not allowed to have hearts on the pony of being hated down and of ruining o credit
we no longer belong to ourselves
who stand first in their self a stained last inter steam
never do give you advice which is not lucratively
it means little enough to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they get dresses or a brace l out of them and that they can drive in are a para from time to time or come to our box at the pure
such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and old a is neither protects nore consols
i thought i could have set the life which offered me but what would you have
what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
marguerite hired out with this long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough put up her the chief to her lips and from that to her eyes
marguerite do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but in the name of heavens tear up the letter which are wrote to you and do not made me leave you tomorrow it would kill me
marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
here it is i have brought the back
i tore letter into fragment and kissed with tears the hand i gave it to me
look here prudence do you know what him wants said marguerite
he wants you to forgive him
one has too but he wants more than that what then
i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled
all mister buzzard grinned

forthwith the grinning jester began shrieking with laughter so that the bells upon his motley cap were all set a jangling
i did but laugh to think the sword of eheu had been so quickly fouled responded the jester and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailor's girdle
one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near hand in the bushes
thou shalt have thy liberty he cried even though thou shouldst run me in pieces the moment thou art free
it had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful very with filmy wings which shone like rainbows in the moonlight
at this moment there was a distant rumbling is of thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten
scissors grow a giant's height and save us from the y ogre's might
he could see the ogre standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the chasm and gnashing his teeth each one of which was as big as a mill still
the sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his beak could carry him
thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this dismal spot while i have the power to help thee
he lifted the scissors and with one stroke to strode the web and gave the flights read e
a faint glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole
the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to thinkin a suitable verse to say to the scissors
as he uttered the words the scissors leaped out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shutters as easily as through a cheese
in a very short time the prince had crawled to the opening
while he stood looking around him in bewilderment a firefly alighted down his heart flashing its little landed and the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me to guy do to who a place of safety
what is to become of me cried the poor peasant

he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
to stand between two religions from one of which you would not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to that like souls
marius was clear eyed and he required the true light
the half lights of doubt tamed him
whatever mayle been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to marc further
he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
his discomfort was augment by all the reflections which occurred to him
in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
they soon elbowed him abruptly
request goa for act to come and talk with me said marius
what is to become of you said courfeyrac
what are you going to do i do not know
silver gold here it is
you will then have only a pair of trousers a west kate a hat and a coat and by boots
that will be enough

the clots dealer was hen for
he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments they went to the watchmakers
he bought the watch for forty five francs

i have ten francs left said marius
that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundreds sou very slowly
one morning on his returned from the los school marries found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistol that is to say sixth hundreds francs in gold in a sealed box
marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt with the respectful letter in which he stated that he had suspicious means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs
at that moment he had three francs left
he perceived that it was no good talking to the old men and at the principal person in the house was the mother
before her he decides a scatter his pearls
the princess was distracted and did dun know what to do she felt she had sent against kate
well doctor decide our fad said the princess tell me everything
he's their hope she meant to say but her looks quivered and she could not outer the question well doctor
as he wised the princess went out of the sigh
the family doctor respectfully ceased in middle of his observations
and there are indications metric nervous excitability and so on
the question stands thus and presents of indications of t berg of this process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
yes set an understood thing responded the eel rated physician again glancing in his watch
b pardon as the else gi bridge dana or shall ha the dru
he asked ah it is
oh well then i can do it in twenty mines
and how about it to her abroad asked the count doctor
what is wanted is the mean to improving nutrition enough lowing
the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
but in favor foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling e premises
and then the mother wishes it he had
ah well not pas to be sure let them go only those dreaming quicks are mischievous
oh times i already then he went to the door
the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling if what was due from him dictated his doing so that he ought to seed the nation once more
oh no only a few di princess come this way
and the mother a company by the doctor went into the drawing room to kidd
when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with years
she answered in and all at once got up furious
excuse me doctor but there is really no logic in this
this is the third time you've asked me the same thing
the celebrated doctor did not take offense
nervous s irritability he said to the princess when she he had left the room however id finished
and the doctor began sign di fickly explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which was certainly harmless
at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged in the deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem
finally his decision was bernous they were to go abroad but to put no fate in foreign quacks and to apply to him and any need
it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had young
the mother was much more cheerful as she went back to her daughter and ken hey p dented to be more cheerful
educated people of the upper places are trying to stifle ever brewing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social war
this is absently inter corrects
in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interest for the enters of the group
the champions of the social conception of light usually trying to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
the man who was controlled by moral influence assent accordance with his own desires
the basis of authority as bodily wiles
the possibility of applying bodily viols the people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison and submission to one will
these bands of armed men said missa to a single will are a constitute the army
the army has always been and still is the basis of power
power is always in the hands of those who control ary and almond in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything in court popularity of the army knowing that if that is on their side of their power is secure
indeed it could not be otherwise
only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
the sins this is not the case and on the contrary men in power always far from being sins through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
even if there was w a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition of men of violence the existence of authority to restrain such valance was an advantage because the violence of the government was less than the violent of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
between the members of one state a subject to a single authority the stripe between the individuals seemed still less and a life of the state seems even more secure
it was produced on one hand by the natural growth the populations and on the other by struggle incog wust
after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
but this justification is never more than temporary
internal dissensions to disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression deserted by the authority over the dissentient individuals
governed authority even if it do suppress private viols always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of viols which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
and therefore the oppression of the oppress always goes on growing after the furthest woman beyond which it cannot go ab killing the goose with the gold nice
the most convincing example this is be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient time subdued that conquest
so it is always been
footnote the fact that in america the abuses of authority exist in spite of a small number of their troops not only fails to dis greve this position de positively confirms li
the upper clusters know that an army of fifth thousand will soon be in sufficient and no longer belong on incitants men they feel that the security of their position depends on the increase drink of the army
the reason to which he gave expressions essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the pope's engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of the day so carefully distributed the refutes so that the regiments from the frontier are stationed in central districts and the regiments from the centre are stationed on the frontiers
the meaning of c privy speech put into plain language is it funds are needed nots foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the in slave toiling masses
and this abnormal order of thanks is maintained by the army
but there is not only one goverment there are other governments exporting there such as by violent in the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its in slave subjects
and so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its neighbor brigands
this increases contagious as montesquieu pointed ab abdon fifty years ago
everye increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defence against its subjects becomes a sort of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
the despotisms of the government always increases with the strength of the army and his external successes and the ogress upness of a government increases with its internal despotism
the rivalry of the european states and constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers who obtained at the least possible express
and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practised upon them all citizens have become their own impresses
this inconsistency has become obvious and universal third service
in fact the whole significant of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transition a personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life the groups of parsons
but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had met to avoid
but inst of doing that they exposed to individual to the same necessity of strife cutey strike with individuals of other states for strife with neighbours
the taxes rays from the people for war preparations absorb the graved part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
the danger of war ever ready to break out winners all reforms of l social like vain and fruitless
but the fed insignificance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent and the social conception of life is not only apparent and that
government assert that armies are needed above all for external defense but that is not true
there are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an accomplice in all that acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
and for the sake of what are making them
im expected for the sake of a states and make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
except with the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish the number that there can only be done by change of en warming and moral influence
so that the justification of stained violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil suppose persons even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago has none whatever now
except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education cultural means a punic in so on
without the state men would not have been able to form a social institutions needed for doing anything
this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men complete be able to dispense with state aid in forming societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
without governments nations were be slided by the neighbors
the government they tell us with its army is necessary defends from neighboring states who might in slabs
and if defence against barbarous nations is meant one thousand part at the troops now under ams would be amply sufficient for that purpose
the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes on the contrary the much greater danger of such tacks
even looking at it practically weighing that is to say all the burdens lid on him by the states no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with a state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantages than to refuse to do so
to resist would need independent thought and efforts of which every man is not capable
so much for the advantages of disadvantages of both lines of conducts for a man of the wealthy class and oppressor
for a man of the poor working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages
saying you know supper
chris looked from idle plated flash like to a cara jack can spark plug
no one it's a jump ban that's jine harris

mike's su expression changed at what want to one of triumph but brisk was only partially encouraged

chris star it off once more passing a bleak little victory and church perched on the hill of mister work's house
an empty lot cut in into by church lane gave a look of isolations of ale shape brick building it sir mister wicker's both house in place at business
the longer wing toward the back on back door that opened on a water street the space between the house in the gon and amby had been made into a neat op along fler garden fenced off with the sidewalk by box shrugs in the white picket fence
a livid yellow stained theorizing beyond the factories and lay clouds lowered and tumbled above
the air was growing chill and christ sided the finished the job
all at once he wondered how his mother was and everything in him and pinched and tightened itself
at the foot of the hill and he reached the house
there were three things that always caught his eye a meant the litter of dust he pieces
otter left the coil of rope in the center the model of a sailings ship in a grain glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of the negro boy and baggy trousers turkish jacket and white turban
but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe at home in bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabelle
he had never seen any one' go into mister wicker's shop now he thought of bed
how then did he lamp and what did ever sell
a sudden car horn walk him from his dream
and the many times hes ain mister workers when now and poured over the rope the ship and the nubian boy he never gone into mister wicker's shop
some now alone till someone should answer the bell they looked eagerly yet uneasily around him to
but with one windows in the lower int outside a long narrows shot was sombre
hadad the hand june beams crossed it from one side to the other
mister hook's back being toward the source of light chris cannot see his face
the double fans a minute wrinkles breaking from ee cornered a temple anden joining with those over the sheep bones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the dome forehead
little tofts of white pue above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarians hair but what drew and held chris's gaze with the old men's eyes
crisp linked and looked again yes they were still there
chris swallow it is mice came back e
yet sir he said
i set your sign and i know boy who eats the job
he's a school made him mine
jenie ear s's name is new reeling is the job
i i just pondered if the pe was to open
what he saw was a fresh chee lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humour in his face and something scented and appealing about his eyes
he guess there must be alive the fire from that room beyond
with that e fear what jakie gig skidding the job sir
but even as he slowly turned the thoughts pierced his minds why do not seen the reflection of the headlights at the cars moving upo a round the coy of wall er street not the hill towards the lef signals
the room seemed overly still
then in that second d turn and faced about
the wide bow win it was there before him and three objects he like best showing frosty in the moonlight that toward in from across the water
a chris the water where is the free way
it was no longer there no were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen to
the warehouses were still there
flabbergasted and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer a peer out the windows in every direction
electric signs no lap lit streets
when the people's dro store and stood but half an hour before rose the ruse of what was evidently an in
and courtyard of his firstly met by flaring torture two shilling the swinging sign hung on the post
the posts plated at the edge of what it was now a prod and money rad
the coach with stopped piled hive with legged stamp to a halt beside the flag court card
they moved it to the end the coach rattled off to the stable
my windows has a power for those few who are to sei
the learning of magick was by means easy
he told his master at once he bought simon goesler is hoard of money is hiding places for it
chris therefore threw himself and of all the prime in areas in his tasks
one afternoon when he had returned after arrest to mister wicker's study he saw that there was something new in the room a ball with a gold fishing it stood on the tablet that mister wick was not to be seen
what should all i do first
how you've in proved my boy he exclaimed it' n time for you to try missus is gotta changed any
suppose i chained and kat chained back
mister worker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for christ to get up his courage
that is nothing happened with a voice like a whip mister wiggs started once
a sensation spread faster and faster
his head swab and he felt fainted no little sick but he persisted through the final words
he thought nor without a feeling a pride and commenced experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight that some little time e laced before mister wicker's voice boom bees by
seventy four book one the return
the figure shoes carved in some eastern style a curved up pointing toes
that all at once the idea came to chris
if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
he squatted on his haunches ex aven the carved wood and figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companions
but how did w a change inanimate to en of it
chris got up and stole back to mister work's door
he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his ram above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was reeling empty we sur doom's proper shape and opened the doors of the cupboard at de far end of the room
the afternoon raining before increased in storm
thus game tho hours before its time thunder snarled in the sky
certain elements were to be mixed and poured the proper time
mister worker began moving about upstairs the full boards creaked crank ray and still chris could not leave until the foot fumed and glowed
with infinite caution chris closed the doors silently behind him in running light be forward greeks to figure the negro boy
it was as it the step mis melted
under his eyes wed fold of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its rounding upon the coat and oh the face
the wind grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of car flowers moved a the bouquet ful
they went down to their corns first

a chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin
certainly my boy boomed out the captain as blue eyes abruptly keen and penetrating
mister finny wan be some time on deck we cannot be own heard in here
his face rose with nervousness that this might doll do was an answer and he stood stiff and stone before captain b lizards
the captain sat forwards in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say i do
the ship it more to me than wife or mother or family
and pause fingering this lower lip the looking sideways in an reflective fashioned chris standing before him
we shall say no more but i trust you understand the responsibility you he
a shook its cargo in its men' be in your hands
yes sir i think i can do it safely or i should not try sir
captain lizards round pink faced creased in its winning smile
you then went on to descrie what else was to father for covering in the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
the cam f losh was not a word the captain or anyone else of his time he had understood
what can be said during that time sir chris thought ask
i am somewhat skilled in medicaments i have to be as a captain of ship and crew know it
i shall say that you are in my own cabins as i can care for you
not since he had left mister wicker and chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
he knew now that his absence for as long as he had e to be away would be covered up and satisfaction inly accounted for to
their conversation had taken some of a while

there was nothing very brotherly in his look as they peared into a bale sharp feats during the process
there don't mind me she said sharply and getting a she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle he had just set down and went swiftly to her room
and she threw back her whew and going hurriedly to the toyed mechanically survey herself from the glass
rightly lately what are you knowand
i stay here that is in the joining room she answered and the face was withdrawn

the acts said that in a of difference of at onion there must be about
he went up to the dabble and striking it with his fingering he shouted loudly ball
he was shouting for the very coarse surge even of which had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole pardi and doubled in o opposition to it the same indict tiens though in a more seemly fall on the other side
shouts were raised and for a moment all his confusion so that the martial of the province had to call for oder a ballot
we shut up blood for our country
the confidence of the monarch that no ticking the accounts of the martian he not of cashier but that's another point
votes please piecing
they expressed the most implacable hatred
levin did not in the least understand what was a matter and he marvelled at the passion with which it was disputed whether there or not the position above flare off should be put to the vote
he forgot as so jane which explained to him afterwards this helgi sen that it was necessary for the public good to get rad of the marshal of the province but to get it to the martian it was necessary to have a majority of wards that to get a majority of boards it was necessary to secure furs right to aboot that to secured the recognition of firs writ boat they was decided on the interpretation to be put on the act
but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respects in such an unpleasant in vicious state of excitement
to u scape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the freshmen bar
he particularly liked the way one brie whiskered waiter who showed us gone for the other younger was and was dured at by them was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly
living advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much e bad jus he turned to sarch evened with the questions where moray to putt it
so as you even avid gowned
that is a matter for each man's own disan he said se rely
having put it e he recollected that he oughter have thrust his left hand too and so he thrust at it though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the bag round

then there was a laugh a button and two knots were found on the box
but the old party did not consider themselves conquered
in replies met off spoke of the trust and nobleman of the province had placed to him the a fatal they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service
this expression in the marshal's face was particularly touching to leavin because only the day four he had been at his house about his trusty business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kind hearted fatherly man
if there amen younger and more deserving than i let them serve
and the marshall disappeared through a side door
they were to proceed immediately to the election

he went to the windows and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being sid around him

these persons were unmistakably singing up place where they could talk without being overhard

then too one must keep of connections

that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
and we are laying out a garden clowning one before the house you know and there you have a tree that stood the centuries in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you don't cut down the old fellow to make wh for the flower beds but lay out sho beds so as to take advantage of the cha

there's a class instinct too of what one ought and ot known to do
there's the peasants too a wander of them sometimes any good peasant tri to take all the land he can

when he came from the bath process visited him again
but hermon was that in the mood to share a joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his returned he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honour of the seventeenth birthday of the old sculptor
she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour
so the artist found himself obliged to relinquish opposition
the banquet was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing daffy and telling her the words of the oracle
he longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescue demeter might yet be the work of myrtles had again mastered him
the approval as well as a doubts which had arise in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts
then he went directly to the neighbouring pace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husbands had rendered and impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy
when hermon entered the residence of the grammaticus in the palace the guests had already assembled
the place by ham's side which alf had chosen for herself would then be given up to arina
true an interesting conversations still had powered to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight u referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyment his blindness debarred him
a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and woman to whom no tad bound him save the presence of the same host
creates had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair haired nio had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing ar sins praises among his professional associates
his son had been the royal dam's first husbands and she had deserted him to marry lis makest the aged king of thrace
the king sister the object of his love cried harmon incredulously
we woman are only as old as we look and the legs entiring woman of this beauty of forty practise arts which give her the appearance of twenty five yet perhaps the king values her intellect more than hi person and the wisdom of a hundreds serpents is certainly united in this woman's head
the three most trustworthy ones are hear amass the liege chrysippus in the amiable process
let us hope that you will make this three leaved clover the luck promising four leaved one
your uncle too has often with praise worthy generosity helped arno in many in embarrassment
how long he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the horse city with delight
when he did finally semen you he fed things which must have wounded you
that is going to far replied hermon
he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arsenal had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in roads
the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interests and alpha eagerly confirmed the statement
her mons into the parent silence
the rodion was just beginning to praise arsenal also as a special friend and connoisseur of the sculptures art when crates her mons fellows student asked the blind artist in behind of this beautiful companions why his meter was placed upon a pedestal which to others as well as himself seemed too high for the size of the statue
yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of score at him
a woman who earns for the regard of all men and makes love a toy easily lessons the demands she imposes upon individuals
only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and alca did not wish to lose hero's regard
how indifferent you look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you was still a genuine creating artist the case was different
those fill loud a denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no idols and snake me i can prove
it was nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
not a sound if you value your lives
to offer resistance would have been madness for even harmon perceived by the loud clanking of weapons round them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prisoner the place of execution
was he to be led to the executioner's block
what pleasure had life to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art
ought he not to greet his su an end as a boom from the immortals
did it not spare him a humiliation is great and painful as could be imagined
whatever might await him he desire go better fate
if he had passed into annihilation he herb wish to follow him thither an annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
but if he were destined to meet his fertil and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not tell them how sure he was a finding a joyful reception there from both
the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was nin nemesis no it was a kindly deity
yet it was no allusions that deceived him
again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
sometimes with the touching entreaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate a mistake
lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philip her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
cried harmon and grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and followed the soldier whom the captain detail to guide her into the palace
to morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path
daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philip was silenced tar with a grave exclamation the order of the king
as soon as the captive artist was alone with a woman he loved he cased her hand pouring forth incoherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly returned the pressure he could not restrain the desire to class perch was heart
in spite of his deep mantle distress he could have shouted aloud in his delighting gratitude
he might now have been permitted to find forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the palest the following morning still sealed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought not to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impulse exclaimed you know that i love you
i love you and have loved you always
danny exclaimed tenderly what more it's needed
but harmon with drooping head murmured to mor i shall no longer be what i am now
then d he raised her face to his asking so the demeanors the work of myrtles
put a terrible or deal again awaits you
an i fool plied also mind could be vexed with you for it
bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it if you consent with a time arrives to become ein conceal i pali nothing
so a kiss intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day
he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
his heart contracted painfully it is solicitude about his uncle's fate increased when philippicus and warmed him that the conspirators had been rested at the banquet and headed by ames the rodion chrysippus and propos had perished by the executioner's sword at sunrise
besides he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting and one last word
on the way his hard throbbed almost to bursting
even and alters image and what threatened her father and her with him was seated far int to the background
he was appearing before his companions only to give truth it's just due
the egyptian o bay and his master crossed the wide space strewn with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the feal performances even had his eyes retained the power of sight his bud was coursing so wildly through his veins that he might perhaps have been enabled to distinguish the statues round him and the thousands of spectators who crowded closely together richly garlanded their cheeks glowing with enthusiasm surrounded the arena hermon
shouted his friend sat and joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk hermon
even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeter he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed int to the suspicion of having become fatal tor art and his nature
honour to merciless and his art but he trusted the snow feast ill assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception and a his prayer for recovery
afterwards it was supposed that he was satisfied with a bloode of oxen lamps and dos and at in exchange for or in account of the sacrifices these god gave rain sunshine and harvest

we now know that all first parents were not foreigners
we now know if we know anything that the universe is natural and that man and women have been naturally produced
we know the parts that life has travelled
we know the footsteps of advance they have been grazed
for thousands of years men and women have been crying to reform the world
why have reforms say
they depend on the lord on luck a gory
they live by fro and viols and bequeath their vices to their chum
failure seems to be the trade mark of nature why
nature produced without purpose the states without intention and destroys without falls
master world for ever remained the victim of ignorant passion
why should mend women have children that they cannot take care off children that are a burden and curses why

the two monsters took off fair shoes and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses
by means of this strata jen they followed so closely that over within a few steps of sarn tom they did not hear them
sarah and her brothers having again passed by the ty frau arrived close to the dilapidated house which was partly in bins and its open cellars formed a kind of gulf along which the street ran in that direction
in an instant the schoolmaster with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized satin with one hand by the throats and exclaimed your money or i will fling into his hole

france who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to al it's request but at once accompanied him to the desired spots e after a shorts delay the count joined them in the salon
my very good friend and excellent neighbour replied the count with a smile you really cater it my trifling exertions
my fathers the com morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitating her place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal
i can scarcely credited
then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity either present to realized plans that i have long meditated
sh m the positive appointments for a particular day an hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my pious exactitude and keeping my engagements day for d hour for h were said albert that will suit me to a dot
so be it then replied the counts and extending his hand toss a calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said to days the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o'clock now promised me to remember this and expected me the twenty first of me at the same hour in the forenoon
i residing my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the father sight of the courtyard and titles separated from the m building
now then said the counted returning his tablets to his pocket may yourself perfectly easy the hand of your time piece will lock me more accurate in marking the time than myself
that depends when do you leave
for france no for venice i shall remain in inly for another year or two
then we shall not meet in paris
i fear i shall not have her oa
well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young man allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey
what is the matter asked albert of france when they had returned to their own apartments you see more than commonly thoughtful
i will confess to you all that replied france the count is a very singular person and the appointment y have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
did you ever need him previously to coming hither
upon my honour and listens me
he dwelt with considerable forth and energy on the almost magical hospitality had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the bottle of the thousand and one knights he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof our trace of all these events save the small yor seen in the distant arisen driving under full sail tow port echo
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to ohain the release of the bandit peppino an engagement wedge as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled
that said france the kin bandits that were among the crew of his vessel
why really the thing seems to meet simple enough
talking of countries replied france of what countries the counts what is his native thumb whence as he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life life as marvellous is alone that hath tinctured his succeeding years with so darken blooming a misanthropy
certainly these our questions that in your place i should like to have answered
my dear france replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend al that the morcerf is in danger helped me to deliver him
what are his means of existence would is his both place of what countries and native
i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from hands of senior vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outwards appearance of ease and and concerned i did not very particularly care to remain
and this time it must be confessed that contrivers of the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's side
well said france with as sigh do as you please my dear recount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation
and now my dear franz let us talk of some the else
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination i'll bear the morcerf would follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge store and which merits a particular description
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate
at quarter to ten a valid entered he composed with a little room name john and who warmly spoke en lish all albert's establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service an on prate occasions the count's cash also

the women he had hitherto known had been mainly his own soft clime and it was not often exhibited the tendency he d acted and curs deplored in missus lon sister
manson was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very provincial
he was sorry for her but he saw in a flash that no one could help her that was what made her tragic
she could not defend herself against a rich admiration a kind of tenderness of envy of anyone who had been so happy as to have that opportunity
his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruel two of dates

it was in the female line as bays of ransom had written in answering her letter with a good dill form and famish his spill if they had been royal houses

and having put himself in a fairway as it hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darcy case colonel ashley went down to police headquarters to learn more facts in the connection with the murder of the east indian

it's just one of them coined in dislike
lusted his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair
gad explained the colonel
the very pair i was going to buy
look here colonel do you know anything about this
and the detective's professional win stinks got the upper hand of his friendliness not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
i happened to see those candlesticks int the windows of single font shop the other day and i made up my mind to buy them when i had a chance
now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen
thought i don't know whether that's his first or his last ning anyhow he had a parr named sheerly
anyhow he infected get along very well it seems
neighbors often heard him scraping al and this afternoon they went at it again the hawk and heavy
toward dark a man went int to bu lamp
you found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was all e's body with the head busted in in this heavy candlestick near it
sure held so tight we could hard to get it out
maybe the fight was about who own the watch for the dagoes talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbours could tell what they were safe i see
and the watch have you it yas the t her
that's the watch announced the headquarters detective reaching in for it going at see
you're not a screams all that are you just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's
a donn of his' voice was plainly sceptical
yes it b half some rough edges on it
and i've rat enough about germs to know the danger i'd advise you to be careful
if you don't mind i should like to examine this a bit
before the big wind in ireland suggested thong with the nodded d irish compatriot slightly to have the colonel
that's rout agreed the colonel as it continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
in a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the time piece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a lead pencil
and dan take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it
has the surprise detective yes
don't scratch yourself on it whatever you do why not
simply because this watch
someone out her to see you
all right met here in a second
sand d fut was the panting answer
i want to talk over darcy's case with you the colonel had said and the two had talked had thought had talked again and now were silent for a time
what are the church of getting him off legally if we gol lighted from a negative standpoint asked the colonel
rather ay of medical question colonel but i should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition
at best he would get off with the scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn't wants that nor do i
and you ii to wanted either
but i want to know just where we stand now i know
but i need to do a little more smoking out first now i want to thinking
if you'll excuse me i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may kat something
in fact i have a feeling d i land my fish
i'd recommend him to you instead of wa stone thanks lapped kenneth
what is it perhaps i can op you
the old adage of two head you know
yes it's still holes good
no alimony replied the coronel puzzled yes just that
and there's no reason you shouldn't know
chuckled the colonel as he skilfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook
and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip in now limp fish into the creole colonel assa gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
the reasons she asked no alimony inquired kenneth
no i wasn't thinking of that
however don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough for to day
well i don't know that you can
it isn't generally ow went on the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him
it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of a baser sort
you don't mean that large struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did
the colonel did not disclose the facts that it was no news to him
ar grafton statement was being unexpected great confirmed
he remembered that cynthia and grafton had once been in love with each other
she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer
because large made no defence
large by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
so i had to let her have her way and mesa last the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel fee
no but he will or i'll su him and get judgment oh he'll pay all right
and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up
still i would like to know
the murder of missus darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweller was tried
it had a double reputations to speak
grave and even reverend the conventions assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper if not better class were frigidly seen in its dining room or cafe
large himself was a peculiar characters
in a smaller place he would have been called a salon keeper
and it was this man rich over said ha some certainly that sent the a retford had married
to this was the answer whispered money
and in a way was true
she also sighed opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges
after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the larch hotel it could hardly be called a home became the scene of many festive occasions
then it was said of large that shone after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat his wife with the refined cruelty that hidden away from the publick underneath his habitual matter there was the wrongness of the brute
but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less off on represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smirched are who had not yet acquired any and were rolling to take a chance
it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me in the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as o the judges and members of the bar to be seeing there kenneth explain to the colonel
meanwhile colonel ashley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he saw darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something to be done always returned the answer
don't gary it will come out all right
i'm going to rectify them but i will take time
it's hard from his mace and too although she's bearing up like a major
so king god bail who put it up
it was high larch
they took harry away while ago
but he is a pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same
only that i darcy hesitated and grew red
good evening colonel he called genially will you join me in a welsh rabbit
thank you no
i'm afraid mighta just and isn't quite up to that as ive had to cut out my fishing of late
now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder
the stopped clocks for instance have you any theory
there were three of them the centre figure been gun of harry king and he was very much intoxicated
that is not always but sometimes it happened to be so now
i beg your pardon he said in the concurred tones he knew so well how to use yet of which he made so little use of late
i said where have you been remarked together we've missed you
i said i was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort
vi polonius someone ask
because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
there was a rattle of coin on the mahogany bars king sought to disentangle a single bill from the waded up currency at his pocket
it's it's an odd coining an old roman one that missus darcy had in arrived collection kept in the jeweler's door safe was the whispered answer
i went over them near the day and noticed some were missing though i sawed them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed
that was hers went on the jaw
now harry king has it exclaimed colonel lesley
even the sun came out pale and watery at known

then i took up a great stone from amongst the trees and coming up to him smote him therewith on the head with all my might and crushed in his skull as he lay dead drunk
behold a ship was making for the island through the dash and sea and flashing waves
hearing this i was sore troubled remembering what i had before suffered from the ape kind
upon this he bought me a cotton bag and given it to me said take this bag and fill it with pebbles from the beach and g forth with a company of the townsfolk to whom i will give a charge respecting thee
do as they do and belike thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land
then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pebbles
to these he committed me commending me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how together that he may get his daily bread and you will earn your rewards and recompense in heavens
now sleeping under these trees were many apes which when they saw us rose and fled from us and swarmed up amongst the branches whereupon my companions began to bel them with what they had in their bags and the apes fell to plucking of the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk
we weighed anchor and shahrazad perceived the dawn of the day and ceased saying o permitted say
when it was the five hundred and fifty ninths night
and ceased not sailing t we arrived safely at barra
there i abode a little and then went on to bagdad were entered my quarter and found my house and were gathered with my family and saluted my friends it gave me joy of my safe return and i laid up all my goods and valuables in my store houses
after which i returned to my old merry way of life and forgot all i had suffered in the great prophet and gain i had made
next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawn prayer and after blessing mohammed the cream of all creatures betook himself to the house of sindbad the seamen and wished him a good day
here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales therein
happily mongst he is one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
presently the ships struck the mountain and broke up and all in everything on board of her were plunged into the sea
but at burneth in their bellies so they cast it up again and it congeal ith on the surface of the water whereby its colour and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it ashore and the travellers and merchants who know it collected and sell it
each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides and after little the rest of my fellows perished one by one till i had buried the last of the party and a abode alone on the island with but a little provision left i who was wont to have so much
but there is majesty and there is no might save an alla the glorious the great
when it was the five hundred and sixty first knight
then signed for myself i set to work collect in a number of pieces of chinese and corner and aloes wood and i bound them together with robes from the wreckage then i chose out from the broken up ships straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the allows wood making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel of the stream and i tied it tightly and firmly as though it were nailed
land after land shalt thou seek and find but no other life on thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul and th thoughts are night al bo shall lend or sooner or late
i rode my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried with a raft with it down the underground channel
and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft my reason of the narrowness of the channel whilst the stream ceased not to carry me along knowing not night from day for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me about in my terror and concerned for myself lest i should perish
when i awoke at last i found myself in the light of heaven and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft moo to an islands in the midst of a number of indians and ab basins
but i was delighted at my escape from the river
when they saw i understood the night and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace bew thee ow my brother
on my brother answered he we a husbandman u tills of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding thee asleep on this raft laid hold of it and made it fast by us against thou should as awake at thy leisure
i answered for a lad's sake and my lord ere i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after ask me what thou wilt
when it was the five hundred and sixty second night
she said it had reached me our auspicious king that sinbad the seamen continued when our landed and found myself amongst the indians and abyssinian and had taken some rest they consulted among themselves and said to one another there is no help for it but we carry him with us and present him to our king that he may acquaint him with his adventures
so i consorted with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respects
so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing t set out with the merchants for that i pined after my people and mine ow land
quoth he thou art thine own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us on o head nice be it for thou gladdens with thy company
by all allah are my lord answered i thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with thy favours and well doings but i weary for a side of my friends and family and native country
then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchants aff or said
he asked me whence they came and i said to him by allah a commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way thither
for state processions a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant eleven cubits high and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks on his right hand and on his left
his letter hath shown me this and as for the mightiness of his dominion thou hast told us what thou hast thy witnessed
presently my friends came to me and i distributed presence among my family and gave arms and largesse after which i yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment mirth and merrymaking and forgot or but i had suffered
such then are my brothers is the history of what befell me in my sixth the voyage and to morrows in shah
i will tell you the story of my seventh th last voyage which is still more wondrous and marvellous than that of the first seeks
when it was the five hundreds sixty third night
she said at hath reached me o auspicious king that when sinbad the seaman had related the history of what befell him in is sixth the voyage and all the company had dispersed sinbad the landsmen went home and slept as of want
the seventh voyage of sindbad the seamen
no o company that after my return from my sixth the voyage which brought me abundant prophet i resumed my formal life and all possible joyance and enjoyment and mirth and making merry day and night and i tarried some time in this solace and satisfaction till my soul began once more to long to sail the seas and see foreign countries and company with merchants and here new things
so having made up my mind i packed up in bales quantity of precious stuffs suited for sea trade and repaired with them from bagdad city to baasa town where i found a ship ready f sea and in her our company of considerable merchants
but the captain arose and tighten in his girdle tucked up his skirts and after taking refuge with hour from sate and the stoned climb to the mast head whence he looked out right and left and gazing at the passengers and crew foul to buffet in his face and plucking out his beard
this he set in a saucer wetted with a little water and after waiting a short time smelt and tasted it and then he took out of the chest a booklet wherein he read awhile and said weeping no are yee passengers that in this book is a marvellous matter to notin that whoso come kid that shall surely die without hope of escape for the dis ocean is called the sea of the clime of the king wherein is a sepulchre of our lord solomon son of david on both be piece
a second fish wad its appearance and which we had seen nought more monstrous
when suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship which rose out of the water settled upon the great reef the haunt of sea monsters where it broke up and fell asunder into planks and all in everything on board were plunged into the sea

hence the anxiety in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in white hall and dawning street and other affected centres

lilford was laid in coming down to breakfast and his manner showed plainly that something was amiss
he an an unpleasant thing to have to say he blurted out presently but i'm afraid you must have a thief among your servants something's been taken out of my portmanteau
it was a little present for my mother and myself for your silver wedding
i should have given it last night after dinner only happened to be a cream jog and you seemed an eyed at having so many to pickets so i felt waller awkward a givee another
the snatcher had been an oran this many years
lady earnest and began coat hiss mother moved in circles which were entirely bend their compass or ambitions and the sun would probably one day be an ambassador
husband and wife looked blandly and desperately at one another
it was missus peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there are thieves in the house we keep the drawing room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while weir at breakfast
she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not be stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later bearing a cream jug in her hands
the pigeon coats had turned paler than ever missus peter had a final inspiration
peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lives so long during the last fewe minutes that a golden weddings seemed with a measurable
missus peter turned to her guest with confidential kindness
peter is little weakness a turns in the family good lord
do you mean the says a cleft the mining like cousin's natur
very with little woman said bitter river gasp of relief i could never have done it
and from the car lying off the coast
don't cry he said i was obliged to come
and and you have not found out anything cum in quick frightened tones
i wish you would believe me that i am in his great trouble about it as you are
that my fathers sir risdon graham as smuggled goods here
he could not help it he hated the smugglers you shall not tell
pretty pray say you will not archie was some
then as archie stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he red the faint rustling once more and again all was simon
he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full a vexation engineer am proper as the prince call are love of our own dignity of which archibald grey stroke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british or officer had a pretty good stock
and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
cold wooer came on this idea directly as he recalled the facts that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless set at people who would stop at nothing
no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would knock me about
the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter is quickly as he could
to do this he must scheme lie hit till morning then make for the nearest point and signal for help lost boat's crew rory surging for him how to escape
the windows was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone sill
next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old fashioned marble mantelpiece fireplace chimney
yes if otherways failed he could escape up the chimney
no that was too bad he cannot do that
sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hose were completely gone now and he said his teeth fast and mentally called himself a week idiot f ever thinking about such people
an narrow table against the wall in two places
he went and tried to force his head through recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the bother would pass
but there was no chance for his body there that had would not go first
a fellow who was shut up i prisoned for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
sure you look ground everywhere boy yes father quite
i'm going on the burns
shall i come do feather no
stop here till sir wisdom c down until among very sorry that we should have cleared our last night only a born fool saw jerry nan's lobster boating into the cove and came running to say it was a party from the cutter yes father
tell im not to be uneasy tis all right and i'll have everything clear away to nay
the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin were archy ra stroke lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down my sleep
would a queer dream felt to himself
and how queer for mister girt to be talking like that to andre teal the boy who helped the cook
and why did any co mister gurr father
there was an interval of thinking over this knotty questioned during which the low whistling went on
and i'm lun me two tell i was up suppose
no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint miss hung like reeds of smoke
what did they say false alarm tell servants and they would clear all away to night see if anything had been left about lobster wrote
once s of that room he could ram and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunting down
oh those bars he want to they exclaimed and he was advancing towards them will just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the windows a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of bots against stone work and rams face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young maned ship and instead
ram was the first to recover from his surprise
blow he said hurl
go round open the door i was should him last night but mistake
i saw you last night and wanted was boy he was
it was you father kicked for shirking and my well i hardly knowed you
nonsense
won't do said remembering
think i don't know you mister orficer
won't do said run quickly i know you
confining the spire to a h but noe him who ack you in
archie stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
he has gone to give the alarmed what the prisoner and he looked excitedly round for a way of escape
nothing but the chimney presented itself
a happy inspiration and come and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curve dirk glanced at the edge ran to the windows and began to cut at one of the bars labor in vain
he divided the pain and produced a few squeaks in grating sounds as he realised that the attempt was madness
the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear selling sound as he found it now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
but at the end of five minutes he stopped and fust back the durk into a sheath
no we can't part with that ha hah laughed the boy jeeringly
v now yes i'll give you a guinea if he will let me out
guinea said the boy think i'll do it for guinea welled them too
be quick there's a good fowl i want to get away at once
cannot you only a sham
why your clothes don't fit you when your caps put on o screed
never mind about that let me out of this place
i told you a fisher boy cried arch impatiently but trying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
not you look like a wild beast in a cage wake a monkey you insolent
aren't checked himself in the boy laughed
it was your turn yesterday its mind to day what a game
you laft and cleared at me when i was on the cutter's deck
i say you do with like to lemon just like a big mogi and show
ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long lo fit of laughter
you rope send me he said
why i could tie you up and a not and heave you of lick with any day what a game
but of a made fed on a salt tack and weightily biscuit talk of giving me ropes and
once more will you come and let me out no
to his astonishment the board d not flinch but thrust his own arms though placing him about the middy's waist clenching his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle

it was immediately following the rock ism robber at eight or iowa that their first appeared a delivered and listen of some local papers and missouri to connect us with this robbery
i urged on the boys that whatever happened we should not she any one
but miller and i a crossed the bridge the three were on some dry good boxes at the corner near the bank and as soon as they saw us went right into the bank instead of waiting for us to get there
when we came of i tow mill if shot the bank door which they had left open in their hurry
jes helen who's hard wor store wass near try to go into the bank but miller ordered him away and you ran a round the corner shouting
kit your gun's boys their robbing the bank
and i called to him to get inside at the same time firing a pistol shout in the air as a signal to the three boys at the bridge that we had been discovered
almost at this instant i heard a pistol shot in the bank
shed weel woods and jim rode up and joiners shouting to the people in the street to get inside and firing their pistols two emphasized their commands
if any of our party shot him it must have been woods
meantime the street was getting uncomfortably hot
every time i saw any one with a bead on me i will drop off my horse and try to drive the sheet or inside but i could not see in every direction
doctor wheeler who had gone upstairs in the hotel shot miller and he lay dying in the street

including those received in and on the way from nor field i have eleven wounds
in chef off clasps order not to sheet was the beginning of the protectorate that minnesota people established over us
captain murdock
but mars port had flourished enough to kill it off
some of mar's laws dated from the time when lawn force ment had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
the stone wall gang numbered perhaps five hundreds
even dare alex and failures had to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which eat out some kind of a marginal living
they were safe from protection rack tiers there none bothered to come s her far out
the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
captain murdock was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
the pressure was enough to get them for him
gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
i've got a free hand an we're going to run this the way we would on earth
your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
the first man making a shake down we'll get the same treatment were going to use on the stone well boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
he picked out five of the men including gordon you five will come with me
the rest of you can teem up any way you want to night pick any rout that open though came l s go
bruce gordon grin slowly as he swung the stick and murdock's eyes fell on him earth cop
two year's gordon admitted
for a second gordon cursed himself
he began wondering about security then
nobody had tried to get and touch with him
there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim foster bob glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
moving in two groups of threes it opposite sides of the street they began their beat
there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from whack of be
gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands
gordon's eyes popped it that
he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
the other four copse had come in reluctantly
he brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys
they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cop started off
to find a pone and call the wagon
we're not using wagons murdock told him lying them up
if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were clubbed carefully
murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulder shaking in tears running down his cheeks
the captain's face was as sick as gordons felt
i want the name of every man and the gang ye can remember he told the me
colonel they'd kill me i don't know
murdock took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tufts
if he should turn up dead i'll know you boys responsible and i'll find you
trouble began brewing shortly after though
murdock sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
and the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men had been beaten before
get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he wor
but the captains stirred finally sighing
now the copse are giving me were covered gordon
but the stonewall ganges backing wane
but us going to be tough on them
bruce gordon grimmest i've got a yellow ticket from security
murdock blanked he dropped his eyes slowly
what makes you think wain will be re elected
nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
ever see a martian election
no you're first he can't lose
and then hell is going to pop in this whole planet may be blown w open
it fitted with the dire predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better foods from the fair restaurant around the corner
cost a more but they be respectable
because i he is always honest according to have he sees it
but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
the groups grew more experienced and murdock was training a new squad every night
it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
this could lead to abuses as he'd seen on earth
but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor wain was re elected
it was night outside and the phosphates at the corner's glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house
it had probably been years since any had dared ris it after the sun went down
and the slow doubtful respects on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that hai system was working
gordon hit the signal switch and the mar speaker let out a shrill whistle
gun suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
you can't do it to me
i'm reformed i am going straight
you damned cops cant oa was blubbering
one look was enough the work papers had the tell tale over thickening of the signature they had showed up on other papers obviously forgeries
some turned away as gorden in the other cop went to work but most of them warn't squeamish
when it was over the two picked up their whimpering captive
chinks the other cop had been holding the wallet
must been making a big contact and something fifty fifty
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
when gordon and jenkins came back murdock tossed the money to them split it
whatever comes to ha gov'nor
like this social call a gordon asked him
the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober no
you are me some bell's governor
eleven hundred fifty credits
you didn't pay up your pledged to the captain fund so i had a fill in
a thousand interest at ten per cent a week standard right
gordon had heard of the friendly interest charge on the side here but he shook his head wrong is he
ha is he turned it over and shook his head
now show me where i signed any agreement saying i'd pay you back
first second izzie's face went blank then he chuckled
he poured out the bills and handed them over
thanks his e thanks yourself
the kid pocketed the money cheerfully noding
the little guy new mars as few others did apparently from all sides
and if any of the other copse had private rackets of their own i he was undoubtedly the man to find it out and needed the information with a beat such as that even going halves and with all the graft to the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped into the bench
go on except dan it
there was a me coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
the little publisher was back at the crusader again
only gordon and she lo were left
credit had been established again and the business were opened
gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwellings built like the dome but opaque for privacy
they have been lucky
sil bird's volunteers were official now
fats place was still opened though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
he reached automatically for the class of ether needle beer
thought ye'd be in the chips
that's mars gord knacker other's comment why don't you pull off the planet fats you could go back to earth i'd guess the other nodded
guessing me gets used to anything hell maybe i can hires e bumps to sit around and mop it up when the ships come in and bi this is a real old martian den of sin
there was a grin on the other's face
finally got out orders for you it's mercury
we sent fy others the same way and they failed
lets say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
you can't stay here
there's a rocket waiting to tranship you to the men on the way to mercury right now gordon side
and i paid her the pay we o you from the time you begin use in your badge she's up shopping
but his old eyes were glinting
did you think we'd let you go without seeing off copper he asked
i i o dread it i'm getting old z he you tell him
he grabbed gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank izzie shook his head
