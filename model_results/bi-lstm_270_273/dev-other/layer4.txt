as i approached a city i heard bell's ringing and l later i found the streets a stir with throngs of well dressed people in family groups winding their way hither thither
looking about me i saw gentleman in a neat black dress smiling and his hand extended to me with great cordiality
he must have razed i was a stranger and wished you tendered his hospitality to me i accepted it gratefully i clasped his hands he pressed min
we gazed for a moment slightly to eh other's eyes
of course you are going there too i said to my friendly guide
yes he answered i cannot the worship i am a priest
an idle i whispered taken by surprise
they worship god they did not exists
but the greeks love their gods i protested my heart clamly my breast
no i said in a low voice
he was an idle then and not a god
it made athens see of light he created the beautiful the true the good yes our religion was divine
it had only one fault in trop of my guide what was that
i inquired without knowing what his answer would be it was not true
produce him
i wis we to myself what blasphemy
then taking heart i told my guide how more than once i had felt a polls radiant presence in my heart and hold him of the immortal lines of homer concerned the dvina hollo
do you doubt homer
i said to him homer the inspired barred
no no apollo is not in ile
he is a god and a son of a god
the air was heavy with incense a number of men and cords vestments were passing to and fro thou in kneeling before the various lights and images
observing my anxiety to understand the mean of all this my guide took me aside and in a whisper tolde me that the peep were celebrating anniversary of the birth the other beautiful saviour jesus the son of god
forget apollo he said with his suggestions of severity his voice
there is no such person he was only an idle
if you would a search for apollo and all the u verse she would never find e when answering to his name were description
i want to se he jesus i hasten turning towards him
will he not be here this morning
when he not speak to his worshippers i asked again
will he not permit them to touch him to caress his hands to class with divine feet to held the ambrosial fragrance of his breath to bask in the golden light of his eyes to hear the musical of his immaculate accents
i asked my eyes feel with wonder in my voice quivering with excitement
would not that then i vented to ask impatiently make theseus as much of an idle as apollo
and it faith that jesus is a god pros them a god why will not faith in apollo make him a god
but i am determined not only to know if it is possible the whole truth about jesus but also to communicate that truth through others
but there is more of a moral tonic and the open and caned discussion of a subject like the one in hand th in the multitude of platitudes
i never deliver lecture in which i do not even directly or indirectly if full and free expression to my faith in everything that worthy of faith
if i dont not believe in dogma is is because i believe in freedom

they must perforce be chained up and they are given what shelters afforded on deck but their position is not enviable
it is a pathetic attitude deeply significant of cold and misery occasionally some poor beasts its a longed pathetic wine
there are gently wanted two on watch which easy matters but it is a squash

there was nothing forward but to grapple with the evil and nearly all hands were labouring for hours in the wights of the ship heaving coal sax overboard and re lashing the petal cases et cetera and the best man of possible undo such difficult and dangerous circumstances
no sooner with some semblance of order restore than some exceptionally heavy way would tear away the lashing and the work had be done all over again
from this moment about f a m the injun became the centre of interest
the water gain d spit of everye effort
the outlook a paid grimm
the mount of water which was being made with the ships roughly handled was most uncertain
williams had to confess he was beaten and must draw eyes what was to be done
the build pumps depended on the main engine
on one occasion i was waste deep and standing on the rail of the proof
the after god were organized in two parties by evans to work buckets the men were kept steadily going on the choked hand pumps this seemed that could be done for the moment and what imaged account as the soul safe got of the ship from sinking practically an attempt to biler out
occasionally a heavy se would bear one of them may and he was only save by his chain
the fun had taken this morning meal and now lay curled up on a bed of moss
when never the fond caught up he was quite contain to fisk about
the danger was certain now it was near
the house had struck a trail where she turned and the fond or save
one was rolling the other had a gun in his hand what should she do
her tired lakes could not propel the tant body rapidly
the go sa the boat nearing her
in a moment more the boat was on her and the m at the oars had leaned over and caught her
i was tormented by thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctor's orders
that old man ceased to give so much annoyance yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams
phil given them orders not to speak to me of this
this made had stolen from me certain little things of some importance and in her fear of being defective she would have been veryain glad if i had died
accordingly she allow me twice to take as much as i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask full i thin cover it myself and began to sweat and fell into a de sleep
they see that my poor friend was on the point of falling to the ground so graved was he to hear this
afterwards he took an ugly state and began to beat the serving girl with all his mind shouting out ahhh tre tress you have killed him for me then
she may did have saved my life so led me a helping hand for i have sweated and be quick about it
flit recovered his spirits dyed and mete me comfortable and ive been conscious of a great improvement in my state began to reckon on recovery
just then the other doctor bernardino put in his appearance who had the beginning of my illness had refused to bleed me
murr francs coes that most able m exclaimed oh power of nature
she knows what she requires and the physicians know nothing
that sim mooted mice ro bernardino made us say if he had drunken another bottle he would have been cured upon the spot
afterwards he turned to me and as if i could have drunk more water
i answered no because i had entirely pointed my thirst
in like manner she was asking for what she wanted when the pool young men bad due to bleed him
if you knew that recovery dependent upon his drinking two flasks of water why did you not say so before
you might then have boasted of his keel
at this words the wretched quite sulkily departed and never showed his face again
the very evening i was shaken with great precautions in a chair well wrapped up and protected from the cold
do not permitting any irregularities for though he has escaped this time another disorder now would be the deaths of him
that he turned to me and said my band vot be prudent come me no excesses and when you are quite recovered i bagged you to make me a madonna with your own hand and i will always pay my devotes tor for your sake
so i mad my mind up and prepared to treble
that day many friends cap to see me among others pierre lady who was the best e dearest friends i ever had
mixt day there came a certain nicolai mona ago who was also a veryain great friend of mine
i had harbored him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house upside down for the m was subjects to a species of dry scab which he was always in the habit of scratching with his hands
meanwhile that abble physician francs ca mona vari attended to m cure with great skill
there they sit me to wait until the duke went by
many of my friends at court came up to greet me and expressed surprise that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shuttered by illness they set that i oughter to have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke
at this words miser augustino the duke's tailor mad his way through all those gentleman and said it that's all you want to knowe you shall know it at this veryain moment
george is a painter who i have mentioned happened just then to pass and myra augustino exclaimed there is the man will accused you now you know yourself if it be true or not
as fiercely as i could not being able to leave my seat i asked george if it was true that he had accused me
he denyed that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sword
my threw augustino retorted you gallows bird
don't you she know that i know it for most certain
georg made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me
then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted
the duke gazed at me and marveled i was still life afterwards he bay fee take heed to be an honest man and regain my hells
when i reached home nicolo dah mona gut came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin written with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards tick french lef because my jap came from a quarter and a man who was able tod destroy be me
i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had injured me and told him all the affair ab the min
he repeated it get hens as quickly as you can and be of goods courage for you will see of vengeance executed sooner then you expects
i the bestest attentions to my health gave pier bagua advice about that thing the coins and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else
you want them to im moralize that ferocious tyrant
you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you our inveterate foe and that devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mind to hang you without any fault of yours
it was firmly believed that duke alisandre was the sun of pope clemming
mister francesco used also to say and swear by all his saints that if he could he would have robbed me of the dyes for that meadow
i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should nevers see them more
i thou sent to florence to request lorn seen that he would send me the reverse of the meadow
nicolo da mona gr to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher lord sea not for it he had replied he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better event one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bringing it without hesitation to the duke for this would be to my advantage
i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate oppressed the world forward to my best ability
this being so as he was a fellow of much humour we used offered to laugh together about the great credit he had gain
i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling peas ready and at a veryain long range brought two of them down with a single ball
i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to hit my mark at two hundreds cubit which cannot be done by otherways of loading
i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we mak haste for rome
we have succeeded in a massing two hundreds ounces of silver enough i trust to erected a handsome bronze figure
to be surer it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priest is boasting about i could live it ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass purpose
but the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrade's thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of cana
here there' is an arm of the sea which is crossed in fairy boats that started soon as sum twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked
when the boatman a passengers heard the splash and saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made everye effort to save him but the wind was fair in the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundreds yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him
when he saw this the room feigned the utmost grief in dismay said to his fellow passengers dis priest whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron and as i happened toe business there as well we settled to travel together
now alas by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone
he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believes a story and pitied and tried to comfort him
then the ran and said to the boatman
what thinks gentlemen added he turning to the other travellers
they of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to there onward journey and all with one voice agreed to what the run and had proposed and so the matter was settled
when at length they reached the shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the ran it overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priests luggage and putting it with his own pursued his journey to chota
fortune favouring his speculations he began to a mass great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself nothing and in the course of time he married a wife who bore him a childs
since then always gone well was me yet had i not been poor i had never turned to sassin nor thief
he would have fled into the house but the ghost stretched forth it withered arms and clutching the back of his necks scaled at him with a v dic of glare and a hideous ghastliness of mean so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear
at length undone by such ceaseless vexation took a bay fell ill and kept muttering oh misery misery the wandering priest isis coming to torture me
now it chance that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest to lodged in the next treat
and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all over
three years ago had the coon a fairy you flung me into the water and well you remember it
happily continued the priest i had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so i reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded and setting up a bronze figure to buda thus fulfilling the wish of my heart
on my journey homewards i took a lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvelous ailment
thinking i could divine its cause i came to see you and am glad to find i was not mistaken
and would it not ill become me to bear malice
repent therefore in abandon your evil ways
to see you do so i should esteem the height of happiness
be of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that i am really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you
and a fit of madness i was tempted to kill and bobbio
fortune befriended me ever after but the richer i crew the more keenly i felt how wicked i had been and the more i foresaw that my victim's vengeance with some day overtake me
haunted by this thought i lost my nerve till one night i beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill
but how you managed to escape in her still alive is more than i can understand

on the day after the death often in the evening the body must be placed in the casks shaped cough u that until recently was a style commonly a news in japan
now among the wealthier classes the long coffin has superseded the small square or round one but the smaller expense connected with a burial in the old way makes a survival of an old type a necessity for the majority of japanese
at an appointed time all the relatives the symbol in the death chamber and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse
there's no official ceremonial morning of parents for their children nor does custom require them the perform any of the last rights or attend the funeral

a case and point is that of the late mister fuca zoah a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countrymen in modern ways and who in his death continued his teaching
in his will he provided that his body was to be buried without washing in the clothing in which he died
through this growing feelings and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies
just before the processions starts a religious ceremony is held at the house which is attended by the friends of the deceased and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery
on the day of the bile great bunches of natural flowers are sent to the dead each bunch so large as to require the services one man to carry it

the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous fresh of a starry eyed flushed cheeked young woman who demanded
where is he pat miss billy gasped the old man
aunt hannah cheeks too were flushed and her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way pet had said miss billy's name

billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall aunt hanna's indignant voice arrested her billy's stopped
pet go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receiveth us pets lips twitched
but his face was preter naturally grave when he spoke
a flying figure brushed by him and fell on it sees by the couch with a low cry bertram's eyes flew open
donn lying found a there men ate later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringing napkin that had been spread over bertram's try
in the hall above aunt hanna was crying into william's gray when and duster that hung on the hall rack aunt hanna's handkerchief was on the floor back at hillside
then very ivery gradually it dawned over them that there was
as if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closer bertin was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable
why oh of course stammered billy i couldn't help thinking that maybe you had found out you didn't want me
demanded bertram angry and mystified
as from my not painting again you didn understand pete deary
she pulled herself half away from bertrams and circling are
billy your quivering sigh
good heavens is kate in this too bertram's voice with savage now
well she bred a letter
billy laughed gayly but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes
and you never did think for a minute billy that you cared for him
he had not been slow to marks with lowering of her eyelids
billy was so glad bertram turned the questioned on her love instead of arkwright
after a minute billy stirred inside happily
you see i wasn't in love with mister ar cit
and and you didn't care speciall be for from mis wint up
billy put a soft finger on his lips
berthed kissed the finger and subsided f he com mined
well what is that is that kate too demanded bertram grimly
there was another silence then suddenly birch from stirred

i don't know as i can trust you out of my sight till then you'll read something or here something or get ale letter from kate after breakfast to morrow morning that will set you saving me again and i don't want to be saved that way

besides i needed you to take care of me cut in bertram craftily
the tender glow on billy's face told its own story and bertram's eager eyes were not slow to read it
sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm
bailey my dear
it was aunt hanna's plaintive voice at the doorway a little later
we must go home and william is hear too and wants to see you
you mean it' be before october
aunt hand glanced from one to the other uncertainly
yes nodded billy de merely
yes i know that is a good while cut in burr marly
we wanted it to morrow but we had to wait on account of the new license law
yet so strong was the effected upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectations of the wood which should make him rich
a part of that impression was due to the engagement which he must nowt fulfill
to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes
because in his cellar days he dallied with the girl who had indeed many chance step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that roar attachment
unable to think of work he left the house and wandered glibly about reach in's park
he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marian who was fats instrument
he wrote to mary him
will you let mee hear bore come and seen
i scarcely thought of beth as likely to kill himself
but why the je did he go all the way out there
i hoped he rep be sneers
poverty you i can only suppose
but i will see weal dal i hadn't come across biffin for a long time
was he he still so merry poor
asked amy compassionately
i've afraid sigh his book failed utterly
oh if i had imagined him still in such distress surely i might have done something to help you
perchance his death was impart attributable to that hopeless love
he sent me a copy of his novel she said and i saw him once or twice after that
having this subjected converse upon put the two more quickly at ease then could otherwise have been the case
amy might take a foremost place among bloodily women
especially now that her father of is threatened with blindness
is it so serious
even if mister yule recovers his sight it is not at all likely that he will be able to work as before
ad difficulties are so grave that
he paused and let his hand failed despondently
i have a good deal of will you remember and what i have set my mind upon no doubt i shall some day achieve
there was ses
the last three years he continued have made no slight difference in my positions
recall where i stood when you first ney
just now i am a need of a little encouragement
you don't notice any falling of my work recently
do you see my things in the current and so on generally
sometimes l believe i have detected you when there was no signature
her storing in that girl's paper h attracted attentions
and i could soe easily put her of rest by renouncing all plan upon her
i surmise that that you yourself would also be put her rest by such a decisions
join will at me with that ironical smile he pleaded
i couldn't go about declaring that i was heartbroken in any event i must be contempt for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgments are pretty sure to be young favorable what can i do
the casas is too delicate by fear for my advice
well i'll g back to my script
again jasp held the white softe for a superfluous moment
yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry
marian could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companions smooth countenance
she had divined that there was some grave reason for this sons and the ping with which she approached was half caused by the anxious beats of her heart
he began abruptly
he gave her such details as he had obtained then added
there are two of my companions fallen in the battle
i ought to think myself a lucky fell i mary what
you are better fitted to fight your way jasper
more of a grey nain
here no veryain well i dined
i have made up my mind aboute our affairs he went tom presently
yes
will you marry them and let us take their chance
you feel yourself indispensable to your father at present
i should be so afraid of the effected upon his health jasper
she paused and looked up of him touchingly
dea i can't feel it would be my duty to renounce you because my father had become light
has one thing occurred to you
will he c con sent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is missus milby
and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him
she listened anxiously and reflected
as i have said there is a veryain serious doubt when the your father would accept money for you when you will more wife
it isn't your fault marian and well then there's only one thing to do
except jasper thy father is helpless by must find means of assuring his support
dig you think them insurmountable
that is just for decided is impossible mar you shall have the plain truth
i don't trust myself
but shall you fs them willingly
put up your rum bila marian
what do i care for a drop of rain she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is at stake how a i to understand you
everye word you speak seems intended to dishearten me
why needed you conceal it if that is the truth
is that what you mean by sign you distrust yourself
we muste each other a gave marian
how am i to eve an hour in such uncertainty this
i do wish it
her emotion had an effected on him and his voice trembled
there is no natural war that a childs should se reread to everything for her parents
you know so much more of the world that i did can't you advice me
this no way of providing for my father
goode god this is frightful marian i can't stand it
i will be faithful to you
he had made a pretense of holding his umber ov her but mari and turned away and walk to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a great tree her face averted from him
moving to follower he saw that her frame was shaken by soundless sobbing
in what can they been more selfishness
but i couldn't save on word that would seem to invite such misery as this
you don't love me jasper at that an end of everything
happiness or misery come to us bi fight
is if him my power to make you happy
but if you had said you loved me before that i should have it always to rem
if i believe anything i believe that i did love you
what can you say to me more than you have said now
remember me as a man who disregarded priceless la such as yours to go and make himself a proud position among fools knaves indeed that one it come to
soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merit it my perverse pride would revolt against it
what can be simpler than the truth
it is a thing that happens everyday either in a man o woman and all would on a demands is the courage to confess the truth
marian you do this will you let her engagement last for another sixth months but without her meeting during that time
that seems to me childish
the rain fell unceasingly and with it begin to mingle and autumnal mist
just the delay a moment then asked calmly
are you going to the museum yes
go home again for this morning marian you carp work
i must and i have no time to lose
good bye she gave him her hand
they looked at each other for an instant then marian left the shelter of the train opened her umbrella and walked quickly away
jasper did not watch her he had the face of a man who is suffering a sevilla humiliation
his sister said very little for she recognized genuine suffering in his times and aspects
a few wings ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest affection but who is bury rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him
yesterday morning he received her final answer i refusal
you will understand they surely you needed no fresh proof how utterly unworthy he is of you
you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you
several days pass before there came a reply
i must only ask th you were will right to me without the least reference to these troubles tell me always aboute yourself and be sure that you cannot tell me too much
we had then but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of the conon it which was requisite for determinations of the fr
several diffrent parties were therefore organized to examine the various routs supposed to be practicable with in the northern and southern limits of the united states
the only discriminations made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern lime and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of executions of all the surveys
he enquiries were made with regards to gunpowder which subsequently led to the use of a coarser rain for artillery
the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by se selection from those already in the service in the regular army and partly by a pont from civil life
under instructions from the presentment the lest was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution
after some further discussion of the questions visors withdrew dis satisfied with the result of the interviews
a quarter master general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake and the appoint to the office had been confounded with his father who was a well known wigs but that heat the sun was a democrat
i assured the general that this was altogether immaterial adding that it was a veryain pretty quarrel as it stood and that i had no a desire to effects a settlement of it on any inferior issue
nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the foxhound of very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size
if you want to hunter your airs on foot sixteen inches is quite pig enough almost to big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches is a useful hight or even nin hies
it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule as color it is so much a matter out individual taste
but puppies are usually sent out to walk and may easily be procured to be captain reared until they old enough to be hindered to their work
he as of course finer but with the length of necks so perfecting the bigger hound the little shoulders of the same pattern and the typical quarters and second flies
and when he is fairly on a line of course he stick to it as the saying is like a beagle
it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otterhound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of goods eighteen inches and an almost at dental contemporary that was called the essex beagle
that a great many of the true order were bread became veryain manifested as soon as the harrier and bega associations was formed and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hound show was reserved for the

all things which followed from the absolute nature of any attribute of gods must always exists and be infinite or in other words are each horne and infinite through they said attribute
proof conceive if it me possible supposing the proposition to be denied that the something in some attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of the said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought
in its nature infinite
must necessarily exist
we have now grated therefore thought not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of gods does not naturally follow from its nature can so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of god which is against our ohs
and bey on the limits of the duration of the idea of god suppose in the latter at some time not to have existed for not to be going to exist thought would perforce have existed without the idea of god which is contrary to our hypothesis for we suppose that thought being given the idea of godness sorley flowed their from
bearing mind that the same propositions may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from god's absolute nature
clary hands it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is is ins cols c phraseology god is cause of the being of things as cy rm
corollary individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of gods poor modes by which the attributes of gods are expressed in a fixed and definite manner

tom sew had been veryain sober during all this married chatter and now in his seat across the narrow aisle he drummed his heels impatiently on the floor
what's up little mother asked tom in surprise at her unusual manner it says this tom
when the news was circulated as it was pretty soon that the party was not to be broken into it all till paris was a completed story the jubilation was such ass to satisfy even tom
oh isn't it oats peas beans and barley girl cried polly as they watched them intently
and his long arm went out and picked to jack and end of an urchin who incautiously regarding such quiet travellers not worth minding had hovered too near while trying to tease the girls
and presently a woman came and took little blue pin afore off and then the rest of the girls unclasped their hands and the ring melts away in the game was over
i'm glad the girls over here half fun said polly as grandpa in his party moved off isn't at nice to think they do
two or three days of rest at martini put everyone in goods shape and gave the them all a bit of time to pick up up on many little things that were behind hand

it's all right grande adele like it he said

poll you always do think of the bestest things exclaimed jasper beaming at her which made her try harder than ever to smile
i wouldn't feel so badly polly he managed to a spirt when phronsie was absorbed with her work fell ike could probably just his fathers did the chin red boy

picture after picture cut from railroad di books illustrated papers and it seemed to jasper gathered as if by magic with cunning little photographs broke up the letter and wound in and out with funny and charming detail of some of their journey

mister king thought so too andy beamed it phronsie so you didn he cried now that's fine i wish you'd wit ne a letter some time

she thanked ta and ran await to get ready for she felt sure her father would not in these her anything
then she washed out little runs frock and put it to dry because she you would not be olds do at the next day
she long to make the beds and dressed the children overnight she was in such a hurry to have all in order but as that could not be she sat down again and tried over all the songs she knew
when she had told her plan peter beni shook his head and thought it never do but tessa baked so hard he consented at last that she should try it for one a week and cent her to bet the happiest little girl in the york
as soon as her father was gone test flew about and put everything in nice order telling the children she was going out for the day and they were to mind tum was mother who would see about the fire in the dinner for the good woman left tessa and entered into her little plans with all her heart
poor tess's heart beat fast as she trudged away with tuo who slung his heart over his shoulder and gave her his hand
it was rather a dirty hand but so kind that tessa c to it and kept looking up at the friendly brown face for encouragement
see now have no fear give them belle monica that is marian will make the laugh whispered tom tuning his hark
one fatted french but noted to her and it seemed to help her veryain much for she began to sing before she thought and that was the hardest part of it
the tama shook get curly had and answered super yes i took you there first for they love musick and o off our country but up among the great houses we shall not always do well
but she had made half a dollar for tama divided th money fairly and she felt rich with her share
her hands were covered with child plains where she had no mittens but she had put them under her shawl and shuffled merrily away in her big boots feeling so glad with the week was over and nearly three dollars tay in her pocket
how gave the streets were that day
how bast g every one was and how bright the faces looked as people trotted about with big baskets holly wreaths and young ever grains going to blossom into splendid christmas trees
but i can't so ill filed the socks full and be happy s said tessa as she looked wistfully into the gas stores and saw the heavy baskets gob
who knows what may happen if we do well returned homo ming wisely for he had plan as well as tessa and kept chuckling over it as he changed through the might
we try one more street and then go home thou it so tired little one
at the fourth some people let them singing all their songs and gave nothing
tessa felt so grateful that without waiting for tama she sang her sweetest little song all alone to
al last mamma said rose and away she went into the dinning room close by
as the door opened test aisle what looked to her like a fairy feast all silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine and tall glass pitchers and smoking dishes thats melt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfaction
ah yes i shall come with much gladness and plays never in my life before cried tama with a flourish of the old cap that made the children laughs
give these to your brother said the fairy prince stuffing nuts an oranges into tessa's hands
ah so kind so veryain kind i have no way to say thank you but runs i shall be for you a heavenly angel and i will seeing my hart out for your tree cried cheater folding the mittens as if she would say your prayer of thankfulness if she knew how
she got up early to see if the socks were all right and there she from the most astonishing sight

the wonderful fresh air that these men lived in night and day had brighten their eyes too so that even the plainest feast and the most awkward man among them was as nimble as an athlete from his perfected exercise
i don't know how to say good bye you nellie told dorothy and n next morning

he took a knife and when his friend to tended away he approached him cautiously from behind took aim turned his eyes heavenwards crossed himselfe and praying fervently god forgive me for crests sake
he never paints everye man he always projects dostoevsky or a night mara dostoevsky
that is why climb in punishment belongs to a lower range of fiction than ane canina or fathers and sons
we sympathize indeed with the fears the bravado that despair that succeeded the crime
he is a grotesque made alive by sheer imagine of intensity in passion
one does not grudge aus and abnormal character' or two
he invent vicious grates a stick ands events comic greatest
was veryain fond of hanging cuts and varying them with great ceremony
as for the carves themselves he betrays the old farther in the oldest of his sons hating each other and fighting like brutal maniacs
serving ripe shouted me two breastless
if i haven't gilding ill come again and kill him
it is easy to see my do stare sky has become a popular author
no melodist ever poured out incident upon a the stage from such a horn of plenty
dost durski is always ready to shows them all in at once
on two opposite pages of the idiot one finds the following characters brought in by name general pin prince ses at a lider ivanovna lizaveta poker hadn he have genie pavel rich redon sky princess be l qui agli are prince miskin coiner e vulgar epine valuer fa disko n stacy philipovna ninna elexa guna deston n generally vulgar
but the secret of dost dale tok's appeal is something more than the multitude in thrill of his incidents and characters
mister marry bold did faces are difficulty and attempts of definition
to him dost ask is work is the record of a great mind seeking for away of life it is mores in a record of a struggle it is the struggle itself
and those voices take shape and certain unforgetable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly mean tavern certain surrounding darkness
ultimately they are the creations not of a man who desired to be but of a spirit which sought to know
because i they have possessed they are no longer m and women
this is all in i measure true
to say this is not to deny the spiritual contented dst ask is work the anguish of the in prisoned souls at battles with doubt and denial and despair
there is inca ski a suggestion of caliban trying to discover some better god than sir tables
the ultimate attitude of justa dusky is as christian is the apostle peters lord i believe helped their might unbelief
and beyond the dark night of suffering and dissipating the night thus sky still seized the light of christian compassion
or evening by the compassion of others like prince miskin in the idiot
his work like his face bears the mark of this terrible conflict
the nobles of the perfect image of the man
as to the man himselfe the vicomte did va gay described him as he saw him in the last years of his life
when he become excited on a certain points one could have sworn that one had seen him before see toed i bent in in police court waiting trial or among baggages who passed their time begging before the prison doors
at all other times he carried that look of sad and gentle meekness seen on the images of old stoic saints
thus a portrait of the men one sees behinds s novels the portrait when might almost have inferred from the novels
it is a figure that at once fascinates and repels
he is not by temperament a singer
his musick is a still small voice unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and' stall
truth to tell mister hearty is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet
he does not expressed life easily in beautiful words or an images
thus he writes in i found her at there of one who
there could not be an ugly and more pres its suguration there contained in the age in the last lime
and pros injuries in the choice of words as well as in images
take for example these of the word domiciled in the passage in the same palm about

he has a temperament sensitive bel that of all but a few recent writers to the pain and passion of human beings
one can remember palm after pole of his with a theme that might easily have served for mister hardy too late christina the lost mistress the last ride together the statue and the bust to name a few
but what a sense of child there is in brownie's tragedies
his world is a place of opulence not a poverty
to have loved them for an hours is with browning to live forever after in the inheritance of a mighty achievement
to have loved for an hour is and mister hardy's imaginations to have deepened the sadness evened more than the beauty of one's memories
for then i u distressed by hearts growing called to me could lonely wait my embers rest with equanimity
but time to make me grieve part steals lets part abide and shakes this fragile frame and e with throbbings of nan tide

but perhaps his characteristic attitude to wars to be founded not in lines like these but in that melancholy palm the souls of the slain in which the souls of the dead soldiers returned to their country in questioned a senior so flame waster how their friends and realities have kept their doughty deeds in remembrance
and general how hold out her sweethearts sworn royal as doves
some fickle and fleet hearts a found a new loaves
and our wives quoth another resignedly dove on our deeds
mister hearty has tree bitter a sensibility to believe much in a glory of war
the vere weeld to mister hardy is the world of ancient human things in which wore has come to be a hideous irrelevance
it may be thought on the other hand that mister hart's ponds about war i no more expressive tragic futility than his ponds about love
futility and frustration ever requiring seems in both
his lovers like his soldiers brot in the gr defeated of their glory
lover are always severed both in life and in death
in beyond the last lamp we have the same mournful cry over severance

they had not much to say as they knew that they were ing for
and by the sac re hen ourselves as well
for whether a state men would have been master over man
before in the state off innocence ban had no mastership of the animals
therefore in the state of innocence before men had its bade nothing dispatch really subject to him
sign disapproved by the order of divine providence which hi governs and fear things by this superi
certainly disproved from a probat men and bother animals
now what aver he's part as pated is subjected what is essential and ell versa
therefore a subjection of other animals to man is prop to be natural
they would now hither on this c h been accepted from the mastership of men as neither at press nor they for that reason accept from the mastership of god his providence has mordan others
dig fi by the fact that god led at the most to men that he mon gave the names expressive that their respected natures
so all aims would have a bit men of their are own court as in the presence day some domestic animals obey him
objection one it was singed that ins sins man would not have had mass over all other creatures
much last therefore would he have a bit m in state of in messene
therefore seems it by this reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems feeding the state lain since men had not been in overpass
now he m reason has the positions a master and not of a subjects
i answer that we must ms amid that in a primitive state there would have been some any quality at least as regards sex because generations the pins upon diversity of sex and likewise as regards a for some would have been borne of others nor would sex union h been serle
there might alca have been bodily disparity
the clarity ms were rise on the parts of nature as bove described without any defects of nature
objections one it will seem that inst of him since man would not have be mc over men
therefore in the state of incense mow not have been subjected man
anthers sense mastership is referred a general sends to any conon of subjects and in this sense even ha has the office of governing and directing free men ca be cut a master
such a con of mastership would have existed in the status between man and men for two reasons
but in the state pins they will would have been lowed miscible age
on the contrary everything generated ins cresting perfects but in thees innocence churning happy begot by generations
therefore from the first they would happen in perfected embody size and power
therefore in the state of innocence there was no needed for women to be borne on the contrary natures process en generation g happy in harmony with manner in which it was established by god
i have been told that mister v brand is in prison for debt i said

though wretchedest creature that walks the streets would shrink from treatin you in that way

bitterly as i hated the man who had parted us and love her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake hopeless in bu
i don't deny it i don't excuse it hopeless infatuation you have forgiven me i said

what was there to prevent her of an insuring her life if she pleased and from so disposing of the insurance as to give van brent and directed interest in her death

i could offer to lend the scoundrel the money that he wanted at an hour's notice and he was an man to excep my proposal quite if easily as i could make it
you are quite mistaken i replied
i am only doubting whether you plan for relieving mister van ban of his embarrassments is quite su simply as he suppose
are you aware as the delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to barrow money and n policy of insurance
i know nothing about it she said sadly
will you let me ask advice of my lawyers
they are trust where the unexperienced men and i am sure they can be of use to you
cautiously as i had expressed myself her delicacy took the alarmed
promise that you won't ask me to borrow money of you for mister van branch she rejoined and i will accept to help gratefully
i could honestly thomas that
my one chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge the corse that i had now determined to pursue
i rose to go while my resolutions still sustained me
kissed mee she whispered before you g
it is only a goodness that overpowers me
