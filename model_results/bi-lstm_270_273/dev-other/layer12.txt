as i approached a city i heard bells ringing and a little later i found the streets astir with throngs of well dressed people in family groups winding their way hither and thither
looking about me i saw a gentleman in a neat black dress smiling and his hand extended to me with great cordiality
he must have realized i was a stranger and wished you tendered his hospitality to me i accepted it gratefully i clasped his hand he pressed martin
we gazed for a moment slightly into each other's eyes
of course you are going there too i said to my friendly guide
yes he answered i cue the worship i am a priest
an idol i whispered taken by surprise
they worshipped god they did not exist
but the greeks love their gods i protested my heart clamly my breast
no i said in a low voice
he was an idol then and not a god
it made athena see of light it created the beautiful the true the good yes our religion was divine
it had only one fault inroad of my guide what was that
i inquired without knowing what his aunts would be it was not true
produce him
i wish me to myself what blasphemy
then taking heart i told my guide how more than once i had felt apollo's radiant presence in my heart and told him of the immortal lines of homer concerned the devon hollo
do you doubt homer
i said to him homer the inspired bard
no no apollo is not an idle
he is a god and the son of a god
the air was heavy with incense a number of men and gorgeous vestments were passing to and fro thou in a kneeling before the various lights and images
observing my anxiety to understand the mean of all this my guide took me aside and in a whisper told me that a people were celebrating the anniversary of the birth the other beautiful saviour jesus the son of god
forget apollo he said with his suggestion of severing his voice
there is no such person he was only an idol
if he were to search for apollo and all the universe he would never find e one answering to his name or description
i want to see jesus i hasten turning toward him
will he not be here this morning
will he not speak to his worshippers i asked again
will he not permit them to touch him to caress his hand to class his divine feet to inhere the ambrosial fragrance of his breath to bask in the golden light of his eyes to hear the music of his immaculate accents
i asked my eyes feel with wonder in my voice quivering with excitement
would not that then i venture to ask impatiently make oasis as much of an idol as apollo
and if faith that jesus is a god proves him a god why will not faith in apollo make him a god
but i am determined not only to know if it is possible the whole truth about jesus but also to communicate that truth to others
but there is more of a moral tonic in the open and candy discussion of a subject like the one in hand than in the multitude of platitudes
i never del her a lecture in which i do not either directly or indirectly if full and free expression to my faith in everything that is worthy of faith
if i do not believe in dogma is because i believe in freedom
oh he tears down but he is not build up is another chrism about my work it is not true
no preacher preach is more constructive
classing truth in a jail ya aging the mouth of the student is that building up or tearing down
when brindle lighted a new torch to increase the lie of the world oll as his forward the stake
count your rights political religious social intellectual and tell me which of them was conquered for you by the priest
i wish to tell you something
the first less be impersonal depots irreverent blasphemer atheist and infidel are flung at a man not from pity but from envy
not having the courage or the industry of our neighbour who works like a busy bee in the world of men and books searching with the sweat of his brow for the real bread of life when in the open page afore him with his tears pushing into the wee hours of the night his quest animated by the fairest of all loves the love of truth we ease our own indolent conscience by calling him names

he is god's mouthpiece and no one may disagree with him
be on way i may command your respect is do reasonable
let us place ourselves entirely the hands of the evidence
as intelligent beings would desire to know whether this jesus whose worship is not only costing the world millions of the people's money but which is also drawing to his service the time the energies the affections the devotions and the labor humanity is a myth or reality
a number of other dates were observed by a christian church at various times as the birthday of jesus the goss was give no date and appear to be quite uncertain really ignorant about it
yet there is no evidence that he was born on that day
why this discrepancy in historical document you say nothing about inspiration
again matthew says that to escape the evil designs of herod mary and joseph with the infant jesus fled into egypts loops has nothing about this hurried flight nor of herod's intention to kill the infant messiah
when we come to the more important chapters of ab jesus we meet with quitter difficulties

if we are to have any mythology at all he seems to argue why object to adding to it the ms of jesus
the immediate companions of jesus appear to be on anther hand as mythical as he is himself
who was matthew who was mark
who were john peter judas and marry
there is actually no evidence that they ever existed
if peter ever went to rome with the new doctrine how is it that no historian has taken note of him
here again we see the presence of a myth
he was the only one who saw them
peter paul john james judas occupy the stage almost exclusively
it is impossible to explain why the contemporaries of jesus the authors and the historians of this time do not take notice of him
could they have been a conspiracy against him
how is his unanimous sides be accounted for
how then are we to decide which the numerous candidates for divine honor should be given our votes
and such a faith is never free it is always maintained but a sword now and by hell fire hereafter
yet the most impossible utterances are put in due mouth
only a mythical jesus could virtually hand over the government of levers de quarters who have petitions to press upon his attention
moreover give ges could keep his promise there would be to day no misery in the world no orphans no childless mothers no shipwrecks no floods no famines no disease no crippled children no insanity no wars no crime no wrong
have these prayers been answered
how many self deluded profits these extravagant claims have produced
and who can number the bitter disappointments caused by such impossible promises
the same which a preachers of the day give he parried his aunts with many words and at length said that the promise was be taken with the provision that what we asked for would be given if god fi it for our good
but he said if he ask anything in my name i will do it and if it were not so i would have told you
did he not mean just what he said
self effort and not prayer is a remedy against ignorance slavery poverty and more degradation
it was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity when with impressible persons love becomes so listlessness hope sinks to misgiving and faith to hope when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret and opportunities for ambition that have been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise

yes the very vulgar of the electric art light made harder the arrival of the incandescent
a number of parent's arc lining compass were in existence and a great many local commonest having carved into the under frenchy for commercial business and to execute regular city contracts for the street lining
thus and the curious manners the mile art of lacy lining was in a very true sense divided against itself within times reveries and jealousies which were nevertheless real because they were by temporary and occurring fl where out evening of the forest words inevitable
hence twenty years after the first adds in station were established the methods they involved could be fairly credit with no less than sixty seven per cent
it will be readily understood that under these conditions the mud lining humpy supplies to its customers both incandescent and ark lining frequently from the same den el electric machinery as the stores of current and that the old food as between the rival distance has died out
in fact for some years past their residents of the national electrical light association have been chosen almost exclusively from among the managers of the great ac and mining compass in the little cities
the ether drawn opposition to the incandescent lit came from the gas indus screw
there also the most peter feeling was shown
the gas manager did not like arc light but he interfered only with his street service which was not his largest source of income by enemies
here again was given the most convincing demonstration of the truth that such an addition to the resources of mankind o was carries with it unsuspected benefits even for his animus
this was not long not unity the spirit is shown and to day in hundreds of cities the electric and gas provis are united under that one management which does not find it impossible to pushing a friendly and progressive way the use of both illuminates

in seventeen fifty he came forth in the character for which he was eminently qualified a majestic teacher of moral and religious wisdom
the vehicle which he chose was that of a periodical paper which he knew had been upon former occasions employed with great success

he was gone
no more deep blue skies up comes in amber tans
she sat by herself at the fire with unlighted candles on the table behind her and being over the day the happy walk happy sketching cheerful peasant dinner and the uncomfortable miserable walking the garden
here was she disturbed and unhappy because her instinct had made anything but to refuse impossible while he not many minutes after he had met with rejection of what order have been the deepest holiest proposal of his life could speak as if its briefs success in all his superficial consequences of a good house never an agreeable society with a soul of bad objects of his desires oh dear
her mother came into the room before this worl of pulse was adjusted into anything like order
mister hale sipped his tea in abstracted silence margaret had the responses all to herself
she forgot that he had not made them an offer
margaret was repairing her mother's worsted work and r the shrinking from the thought of the long evening and wishing bedtime were come that she might go over the events of the day again
margaret
i want speak to about something very seen as to us
very serious to her soul
mister lennox had never had the opportunity of having any points conversation with a father after her refusal or else that would indeed be a very serious affair
but she soon felt it was not about anything which having only lately and suddenly occurred could have given rise to any complicated box and her father wished to speak to her
mister hale did not answer for a may duo
margaret could not bear the sight of the suspense which was even more distressing to have father than to herself
but why dear papa do tell me
because i must no longer be minister in the church of england
but nothing to the shock tree received from mister hale's last speech what could he mean
it was all the worse for being so mysterious
why can you no longer the ex clergyman
surely it's a bishop had told all be know about frederick and the harden just
margaret i will tell you about it
a re lancer any questions this once but after to night let us never speak of it again
i can need the consequences of my painful miserable debts but it is an effort beyond me to speak of what has calls me some with suffering
no not doubts as to religion not the slightest injury to that he paused
margaret's sighed as if standing on the words of summing in horror
margaret how i love the holy church from return to be shut out
he could not go on for a long when jot him
margaret could not tell what to say i seemed to her as terribly mysterious as if her father were about to do wh my harm tan
the one stay foundation of her harm of her idea of her beloved father thin wheeling and walking
he swallowed down the dry choking sob which had been heaving up from his heart har the tool and going to his bookcase he took down a volume which he had often been reading lately and from which he thought he had due right sprint to enter upon the course in which he was now involved
mis listen day margaret said he putting one arm around her waist
when god will not use dee one kind yet he will in another
if when thou art charged with corrupting god's worship also find thy loves though pretendedst a necessity or it own order to a continuance in the ministry
as he read this and glanced at much more which he did not read he gained resolution for himself and felt as if he too could be brave and firm in doing what he believed to be right but as he ceased he heard margaret's low convulsive sob and his courage sang down under the keen sense of suffering
i have borne long with self reproach that would have roused anyone less tor bid and cowardly than mine
he shook his head as he went on
margaret i tried to do it i tried to content myself with simply refusing the additional prevalent and stopping quietly here stranding my conscience now as i had strained it before
god forgive me
he rose and walked up and down the room speaking no words of self reproach and humiliation of which margaret was thankful to hear but a few
margaret i return to the old said burden we must leave helstone
yes
i have written to the bishop i d say i've told you so but i forget things just now said mister hale collapsing into his depressed manner as soon as he came to took a gard natural fact details informing him of my intention to resign the speaker
they are but what i have cried upon myself without a wail
that would be a trial but worse falworth were the departing for my dear people
he will come to stay with us to morrow
was it to be some sudden then
what is mama say
margaret i am a poor coward after all i cannot fear to give pain
yes indeed she must said margaret
perhaps after all she may not oh yes
she well she must be shot as the force of the blow re turned upon herself and crying to realize how another would take it
to milton northern he answered with a dull indifference for he had perceived that although his daughter's love had made her claim to him and for a moment tried to see him with her love yet the keenness of the pain was as fresh as ever in her mind
milton o them
yes said he in the same discordant in different way
but he with this quick intuitive something read in her face as in the mirror the reflections of his own moody depression and turned it off with an effort
you shall be told old mob it
only help me to tell your mother
i am going out for the day to bid father dobson and the poor people on bracy common good bye
would you dislike breaking it to her very much margaret
margaret did dislike it dick ching from it more than from anything she had ever had to do in her life before
mister hale shook his head despondingly he pressed her hand in token of latitude
margaret was nearly upset again into a burst of pine
to dan her thoughts she said now tell me paa what up nana
you and mamma have some money independent of the income from the living have not you aunt shaw has i know
seventy of that has always gone to frederick since he has been abroad
you must have some pay for serving with the spanish arming
frederick must not suffer said margaret decidedly in a foreign country so unjustly treated by his own a hundreds is left
no
said mister hale that would not answer i must do something
i can always decide better by myself and not influenced by those whom i loved said he as a half apology for having arraigned so much before yet told any one of his family of his intentions
i can out stand objections
and make me so undecided
mister hale continued a few months ago when my missie of debt became more than i could bay without speaking i wrote to mister bell you remember mister bell margaret
no i never saw him i think
at any rate he has property then which has very much increased and vallee since morton has become such a large manufacturing town
i don't know that he gave you my friend
a private tutor
said margaret looking scornful one in the world in manufactures one with the cassocks on literature on the accomplish of a gentleman
oh said her father some of them really seem to be fine fellows conscience of their own deficiencies which is more than many man at oxford is
somewhat picture to be better instructed than they themselves have been
and in milton margaret i shall find a busy life not a happy one and people and seeming so different that i shall never be reminded of helstone
discordant as it was with almost a detestation for all she had ever heard of the north of england the manufactures the people the while in big country there was this one recommendation it would be different from helstone and could never remind them of that beloved place
when do we go
i do not know exactly
i want you to talk it over with you
you see your mother knows nothing about it yet but i think in a fortnight after my deed of resignation assented i shall have no right to remain
margaret was all withstand
but she recovered herself immediately
yes papa it had better be fixed soon and decidedly as you say
poor poor maria
oh if i were not married if i were but myself of the world how easy would be
no said margaret sadly i will do it
you must one deceive yourself into doubting the reality of my words my fixed intention and resolve
he looked at her in the same steady story manner for some moments after yet unspeaking
the blessing of god be upon thee my child
the next moment she feared less dis answer to his blessing might be reverent wrong might hurt him as coming upon his daughter and she threw her arms around his neck
she heard him murmured to himself the martyrs and confesses had the more pain to bear i will not shrink
they were startled by hearing missus hale inquiring for her daughter
it was long since a rostov said news of nicholas
not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed and his son's handwriting
on receiving it he ran on tiptoe to his study and alarm and haste trying to escape notice closed the door and began to read the letter
each time that these hens began to meet the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at anna mikhaylovna the latter very adroitly turned the conversation to insignificant matters
but for god's say be careful you no hurt me affect your mamma
no a my true word of honor said natasha crossing herself i won't tell anyone
and she'd run off at once to sonya
she rushed to sonya hugged her and began to cry
it's true all yee women are craye babe remarked petya piecing the room with large resolute straits
you are all b lubbers and understand nothing
natasha smiled through her tears
what nasty brutes they are
hold your tongue peter what a goose you are
sonya smiles do i remember nicholas
i remember nikolinka too i remember him well she said
no she shut her eyes
she felt that sonya was speaking the truth that the worst such love as sonya was speaking of
she believed it could be but did not understand it
shall you write to him she asked
now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of herself and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had taken on himself
i don't know
sonya's smiles no
it's because she was in love without fat one his spectacles that was her pitcher described his namesake the new count bezukhov and now she's in love without singer he met natasha's italian singing master that's why she's ashamed
petya you're stupid said natasha
the countess had been prepared by enim mikhaylovna's heads at dinner
on retiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox while the tears kept coming into her eyes
the coats pretty ear to the keyhole and lizard
at first he heard a sound of indifferent voices then anna mikhaylovna's voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silence then both voices together with glad intonations and then fruit steps
anna mikhaylovna opened the door
when she heard this sonya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and unable to bear the loos turned upon her ran away into the dancing hall we'll round it at full speeded with her dress puffed out like a balloon and flushed and smiling plumped down on the floor
the comtesse was cry
from all he says one should be glad and not cry
how charmingly he described said she reading the descriptive part of the letter and what a soul
i always said when he was only so high i always said
the pavlograd held feast after feast celebrating a wars they had received for the campaign and made expeditions to all modes to visit a certain caroline the hungarian who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses
the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading their cleanliness and discipline
the regiments had entered and left the town with their bands playing and by the grandeurs orders the men had marched all the way in step a practice on which the guards prided themselves the officers on foot and at their proper pulse
boris had been quartered and had marched all the way with berg who was already in commin of a company
boris during the campaign had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become acquainting with prince andrew bolkonski though whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in chief stuff
berg and boris having rested after yesterday's march were sitting clean and neatly dressed at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them plain chess
well how are you going to get out of that he remarked
at that moment door opened
dear me how you have changed
he was about to embrace his friends but nicholas avoided him
he wanted to pinch him push him do anything but kiss him a thing everybody did
but notwithstanding there spars embraced him in a quiet friendly way and kissed him three times
they had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when young mated their first steps and life roads each saw immense changes in the other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps
i did not expect you to be he added
you know of course at his imperial highness wode with our regiment all the time so that we in every comfort in every advantage
what receptions we had in polands
what dinners and balls i can't tell you
oh you guard said rostov i say space a wine
he went to his bed drew a parts unto the clean pillow and sent for wine
yes and i have some money and letters to give you he added
i don't mention it coes i quite understand said berg getting up and speaking in a muffled and gutter or voice
go across to argos they invited you added boris
bert put on the cleanest of coats without a spot or speck of dust stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and having insured himself from the way rostov looked at it that his court had been noticed left the room with a pleasant smile
oh dear was a beast i are muttered rostov as he read a letter why
well have you sank gabriel for some white all right les hou some
in the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to bagration which the old countess and anna mikhaylovna's advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to take it to it destination and make use of it
why have you thrown that away asked boris
it is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i wanted for
he looked intently and inquiringly into his friend's eyes evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question
which you believe it count i was not at all alarmed as i knew i was right
i came forward burke stood up and showed how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self complacency than his it
well he stoned at me as the saying is star and star and stormed
there was not a matter of life but rather of death as the saying is
albanian and devils and two siberia said berg with a sagacious smile
when still i remained silent and what do you think cat
the next day was not even mentioned in the orders of the day
that's the weak said berg lighting his pipe and emitting wings a smoke
yes i was faint it rostov smiling
rostov with a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie
he began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened it imperceptibly involuntarily and inevitably he elapsed into falsehood
prince andrew who liked to help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed towards boris who had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what young man wanted
in spite of prince andrew's disagreeable ironical tone in spite of the contemn with which rostov from his fighting army points view regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently won rostov felt confused blushed and became silent
force enquired what news there might be on the staff and whats without indiscretion one may ask about our plans
we shall probably advance replied bolkonski evidently reluctant to see more in the presence of a stranger
burke at the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was rumor the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled
i was stare said rostov angry as if intending to insult the aid de camp
with a slightly contemptuous smile he said yes that are many stories now told her at that affair
but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy's fire
our stories have some weight not like the stories as those fellows on the staff who get the wars without doing anything
however he added rising you know my name and where to find me i don't forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted and as a man older than you my advice is to let the matter drop
exclaimed prince andrew and was about to them both he went out
and he was still more angry at having omitted to see it
he ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of bars rode home
should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that wide him all the wee
i see sure of some depart and not perhaps was out an aid longing too to get the island along with his happy knobs
where well do friends i say doon little know that the individual who regards you from the beach is your friend and historiographer and pother

i have seen snobs in pink coats and hunting boots scouring over the campan of rome and have heard the roads and their well known slang in the galleries of the vatican and under the shadowy arches of the colosseum
my lady marchioness comes on board looks round with that happy air of mingled terror and impertinence which distinguishes her ladyship and rushes to her carriage for it is impossible that she should mingle with the other snobs of deck
there she sits and will be ellen private

and davers you'd best take the pistol casas into his cabin

what at one at hound's ditches is
he will never spare himself any cheap enjoyment
i have said before i like to look at the peoples on their gala days they are so picturesquely and outrage sees splendid and happy
yonder comes captain ball spick and span tight and trim but travels for four or sixth months seven year of his life who does not commit himself by luxury of raiment or insolence of demeanour but i think is as greatest suppers any man on board

the next person is but hark
but a gross instance of snobbishness happens i should not be indignant journalist calls the public attention dues that delicacy too
how for instance could set wonderful kate of the earl of mangle botz and his puss be examined in the snobbish point of view

as a reader for i hate your robs has a sovereign knowledge of human nature i need not say more to satisfy him said my hero could not go on at this rate without some slight experience of season to dental mementos
to speak the truth he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small book debts of this stamp which notwithstanding a genius as frequent advice he too much disregarded thinking that as not one of them was contracted through any malignity but on the contrary from an honesty of mind and a mere jo city of humor they would all of them be crossed out in course
eugenius would never admit this and would often tell him said one day a rosa he would certainly be reckoned tows and he would often add in an accent of sorrowful apprehension to his uttermost bight
what inclined eugenius to the same opinion was as follows
yorick followed eugenies was his eyes to the door his own closed them and never opened them more
alas po doric
now this is how arthur hunted the stag
and the last dog that was let loose was a favorite dog of arthur cabal was his name
then they sounded the death horn for slaying and they all gathered rout
one wished that should be given to the lady best beloved by him and anon that to the lady whom he loved best
and after midday they beheld an unshaped little man upon a horse and after him a day or a damsel also on horseback and after her a knight of live stature bowed down and hanging his head low and sorrowfully and clad in broken and worthless armour
i know not who they are said he but i know said guenever this is the night whom durin pursuit and meet things that he comes not here by his own free will
but durin has overtaken him in avenging insulted the maiden to the uttermost
lady said he at the gate there was a knight and i saw never a man of so pitiful an aspect to look upon as he
i do said he he tells me that he is erin the son of mood
then she replied i know him not
so guenever went to the gate to meet him and he entered
and durin greets thee well and in greeting thee he compelled me to come hither to do thy pleasure by the insult which thy maiden received from the dwarf n way did he overtake thee
sir said she when thinkest thou that durin will be here
tomorrow lay i think you will be here with the maiden
i am lord said he and i have met with much trouble and received wounds unsupportable
well a loth or from what i hear it behooves whatever to be merciful towards thee
the mercy which thou desirest lord said she will i grant him since it is his insulting to thee that an insult should be offered to me as to thyself
thus will it be best to do said arthur let this man have medical care until it be known whether he may live
to grover and her handmaid said he
and the steward of the household so ordered her
and being young he changed himself and grew to hate the sin that seemed so like his own of modred arthur's nephew and fell at last in the great battle fighting for the king
and when durin came to the place when guenever was he saluted her
then they went in and dismounted
heaven protect thee said arthur and the wotton of heaven be unto thee
and inasmuch as thou hast vanquished edwin the son of ned thou hast had a prosperous career
and from that time she became his wife
and the maiden took up her boat in the palace and she had many companions both men and women and there was no maiden more esteemed than she in the island of britain
and a year and a second and a third he preceded thus until his fame had flown over the face of the kingdom
and he greets thee well as an uncle should greet his nephew and as a vassal should greet his lord
and the neighboring chiefs knowing this grow insolent toward him and covered his land in possessions
and arthur told you aint the cause of the mission and of the coming of the ambassadors to him out of conway truly said durin be it to my advantage or disadvantage lord i will do according to thy will concerning this embassy
what discourse said guenever do i hear between you
said durin i think i shall have enough of knighthood with me and they set forth
and never was there seen a faro holds journeying towards the severn
and he said to current i am a feeble in an aged man and whilst i was able to maintain the demean for thee for myself i did so
and everyone asked that which he desired
and they were not long in giving so eager was everyone to bestow gifts and of those who came to as gifts none departed unsatisfied
then d rates and e basses to the men of cornwall to ask themis
and they all said that it would be the fulness of joy and honour to them for durin to come and receive their homage
so he received the homage of such as were there
and the day after the followers of other intended to go away
drain as he had been used to do when he was at author's court frequented tournaments
before grain the scored to the enemy i saw steeds white with foam and after the shout of battle a fearful torrent
these tidings came to urban
not i by my confession unto heaven said she there was nothing more hateful unto me than this
and the tis she said in the words she had spoken awoke him
and evil betide me said he if thou returnest here until thou knowest whether i have lost my strength so completely as thou didst say
then doran went to see urban
sir said he i am going upon a quest and i am not certain when i may come back
take heed if unto thy possessions until my return
but one person only will gored me
and he desired enid to mount her horse and to ride forward and to keep a long way before him
and unless i speak unto thee say not thou one word either
and though thou shouldst desire to see my defeat in my death by the hands of those men yet do i feel no dread
and he received him and that not feebly
in saying not one word unto me unless i speak first unto thee
i will do as far as i can lord said she according to thy desire
i maiden said he it is vain to a temper ceding forward
i cannot by any means refrain from sleep through weariness said he do thou therefore watched the horses and sleep not
and when she saw the dawn of day appear she looked around her to see if he were waking and thereupon he woke
and they left the wood and they came to an open country with meadows on one hand and mo was mowing the meadows
my lord he added will it be displeasing to be if i ask whence thou comest also
wilt thou fowl my counsel said the youth and take thy meal from me
what sort of meal he inquired
then they washed and took their repast
i go now lord said he to meet the knight and to conduct him to his lodging
i will do lord said she as thou sayest
and after they had eaten and drank drain went to sleep and so did een it also
the date seem on u point but throughout the period the offices and men of the ship have been unremittingly busy
bows attacked the ship's stores surveyed re listen re stowed them saving very much space by un stowing numerous cases and stowing the contents in the lazarette
without steam the lek c now be kept under with the hand pump by two daily efforts of a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes
as the ship was and in her present heavily laden condition would certainly have taken three to four hours each day
the large green tent was put up and proper supports made for
the enter room staff in aeson's people on the engines scientists was stowing their laboratories the cook refitting as galley and so forth not a single spot but had its band of workers
the man's space such as is therefore extends from the fore hatch the stem on the main deck
under the forecastle or stalls of fifteen ponies the maximum the space would hold the narrow irregular space in fronts packed tight with fodder
neatly behind the forecastle brocade is a small booby hatch the only interest to the men's mess deck and bad weather
abaft the fore hatch is the ice house
we manage to get three tons of ice one hundred sixty two caucasus of mutton and three cock oases of beef beside some boxes of sweetbreads and kidneys into this space
the sacks containing this last added to the goods already mentioned make a really heavy deck cargo and one is naturally anxious concerning it but everything that can be done by lashing and securing has been done
forage i originally ordered thirty tons of compressed oaten hay from melbourne
the scene is wholly enchanting in such a view from some sheltered sunny corner and a garden which blazes with masses of red and golden flowers tends to feelings of inexpressible satisfaction with all things
a great mass of people assembled
cain i lunch with the party and d zeal and company ship roper hoo
telegram to say tana had arrived sunday night
a third sledge stand across the break of the poop in the space hitherto occupied by the after wench
the quantities to and half tons and the space occupied considerable
the ship was over two feet by the stern but this will soon be remedied
they must perforce be chained up and they have given what shelters afforded on deck but their position is not enviable
it is a pathetic attitude deeply significant of cold and misery occasionally some poor beast amidst a long pathetic wine
there are generally wanted to on watch which uzes matters but it is a squash
later in the day the wind has veiled to the westward heading us slightly
oates and atkinson with intermittent assistance from others were busy keeping the ponies on their legs
there was nothing for it but to grapple with the evil and nearly all hands were laboring for hours in the weights of the ship heaving coal sacks overboard and re lashing the petrol cases et cetera and the best man are possible under such difficult and dangerous circumstances
no sooner was some semblance of order restored than some exceptionally heavy wave would tear away the lashing and the work had to be done all over again
from this moment about four m the in roan became the centre of interest
the water gained his spite of every effort
the outlook apaid grim
the amount of water which was being made with the ship so roughly handled was most uncertain
williams had to confess he was beaten and must draw fires what was to be done
the built pump is depended on the main engine
on one occasion i was waste deep and standing on the rail of the proof
the after god were organized in two poddies by evans to work buckets the men were kept steadily going on the choked hand pumps this seemed all that could be done for the moment and what imaged account as the soul safe got of the ship from sinking practically an attempt to bail her out
occasionally a heavy sea would bear one of them away and he was only saved by his chain
the far had taken this morning meal and now lay curled up on a bed of moss
whenever the fawn caught up he was quite content to frisk about
the danger was certain now it was near
the howls had struck a trail where she turned and the farm was save
one was rolling the other had a gun in his hand what should she do
her tired lakes could not propel the tyre body rapidly
the gat saw the boat nearing her
in a moment more the boat was on her and the men at the oars had leaned over and cut her
i was tormented by thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctor's orders
that old m cease to give so much annoyance yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams
felicia given them orders not to speak to me of this
this maid had stolen from me certain little things of some importance and in her fear of being detected she would been very glad if i had died
accordingly she allowed me twice to take as much as i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask full i then covered myself and began to sweat and fell into a deep sleep
they see that my poor friend was on the point of falling to the ground so grieved was he to hear this
afterwards he took an ugly state and began to beat the serving girl with all his mind shouting out ah traitress you have killed him for me then
she may did have saved my life so let me a helping hand for i have sweated and be quick about it
felice recovered his spirits dried and make me comfortable and i been conscious of a great improvement in my state began to reckon on recovery
just then the other doctor bernardino put in his appearance who at the beginning of my illness had refused to bled me
maestro franc chest goes that most able men exclaimed oh power of nature
she knows what she requires and the physicians know nothing
that sim booted mice ro bernardino made uns saying if he had drunk another bottle he would have been cured upon the spot
afterwards he turned to me and asked if i could have drunk more water
i answered no because i had entirely pointed my thirst
in like manner she was asking for what she wanted when the poor younger man bad du to bleed him
if you knew that is recovery depended upon his drinking two flocks of water why did you not say so before
you might then have boasted of his kill
at these words the wretched quiet sulkily departed and never showed his face again
the very evening i was taken with great precautions in a chair well wrapped up and protected from the cold
do not permit any irregularities for though he has escaped this time another disorder now would be the death of him
then he turned to me and said my van veneto be prudent commit no excesses and when you are quite recovered i beg you to make me a madonna with your own hand and i will always pay my devotions to it for your sake
so i made my mind up and prepare to travel
that day many friends came to see me among others pierre landy who was the best and dearest friend i ever had
next day there came a certain niccolo d monte ago who was also a very great friend of mine
i had harbored him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house upside down for the man was subject to a species of dry scab which he was always in the habit of scratching with his hands
meanwhile that able physician francesco d monte marquis attended to mayo with great skill
there they sit at me to wait until the duke went by
many of my friends at court came up to greet me and expressed surprise that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shattered by illness they said that i ought to have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke
at these words mister augustino the duke's taylor made his way through all those gentlemen and said if that's all you want to know you shall know it at this very moment
georgia is a painter whom i have mentioned happened just then to pass and my astra augustino exclaimed there is the man will accuse you now you know yourself if it be true or not
as fiercely as i could not being able to leave my seat i asked georgia if it was true that he had accused me
he denied that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sword
myra augustino retorted you gallows bird
don't you know that i know it for most certain
georgia made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me
then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted
the duke gazed at me and marvelled i was still alive afterwards he bade me take heed to be an honest man and regain my hells
when i reached home niccolo de monte geo came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin written with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards take french leaf because my jeopardy came from a quarter and a man who was able to destroy me
i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had endured me and told him all the affair about the mint
he repeated get hence as quickly as you can and be of good courage for you will see your vengeance executed sooner than you expect
i the best attention to my health gave pietro bargo advice about stamping the coin and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else
you want them to immortalized that ferocious tyrant
you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you i will inveterate foe and that devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mind to hang you without any fault of yours
it was firmly believed that duke alessandro was the son of pope clement
master francesco used also to say and swear by all his saints that if he could he would have robbed me of the dye for that meadow
i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more
i now sent to florence to request laurent tino that he would send me the reverse of the meadow
nicolo da montevideo to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher lawn cy not for it he had replied he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better invent one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bring it without hesitation to the duke for this would be to my advantage
i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate and pressed the worth forward to my best ability
this being so as he was a fellow of much humour we used offered to laugh together about the great credit he had gain
i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling peas ready and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball
i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to heap my mark at two hundred cubits which cannot be done by other ways of loading
i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we made haste for rome
we have succeeded in amassing two hundred ounces of silver enough i trust to erect a handsome bronze figure
to be sure it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priest is boasting about i could live at ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose
but the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrade's thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of cana
here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in ferry boats that start as soon as some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked
when the boatmen and passengers heard the splash and saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made every effort to save him but the wind was fair in the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him
when he saw this the room feigned the utmost grief and dismay and said to his fellow passengers this priested whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron and as i happened to have business there as well we settled to travel together
now alas by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone
he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believes a story and pitied and tried to comfort him
then the roan and said to the boatman
what thank you gentlemen added he turning to the other travelers
they of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their onward journey and all with one voice agreed to what the roan and had proposed and so the matter was settled
when at length they reached the shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the monet overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priest's luggage and putting it with his own pursued his journey to kiyoto
fortune favouring his speculations he began to amass great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself nothing and in the course of time he married a wife who bore him a child
since then all was gone well with me yet had i not been poor i had never turned to sassin north thief
he would have fled into the house but the ghost stretched forth its withered arm and clutching the back of his neck scowled at him with a vic of glare and a hideous ghastliness of mean so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear
at length undone by such ceaseless vexation took bay fell ill and kept muttering o misery misery the wandering priest is coming to torture me
now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest who lodged in the next street
and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all over
three years ago at the kuan a ferry you flung me into the water and well you remember it
happily continued the priest i had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so i reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded in setting up a bronze figure to buddha thus fulfilling the wish of my heart
on my journey homewards i took a lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvelous ailment
thinking i could divine its cause i came to see you and am glad to find i was not mistaken
and would it not ill become me to bear malice
repent therefore and abandon your evil ways
to see you do so i should esteem the height of happiness
be of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that i am really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you
and a fit of madness i was tempted to kill am bra bio
fortune befriended me ever after but the richer i grew the more keenly i felt how wicked i had been and the more i foresaw that my victim's vengeance would some day overtake me
haunted by this thought i lost my nerve till one night i beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill
but how you manage to escape in her still alive is more than i can understand
a guilty man said the priest with a smile shudders at the rustling of the wind or the chattering of a stork speak a murderer's conscience preys upon his mind till he sees what is not
every well ordered japan is home as the old fashioned kind has a little shrine which is the centre of the religious life of the house
she it is who sets the rice and wine before the ancestral tablets who lights the little lamp each night and who sees that at each feast day in anniversary season the proper food is prepared and set out for the household gods
these must be kept carefully by the mother is a safe guarded inst the many evils that beset child life
visits to noted temples by relatives and friends often result in additions to the child's collection
all these were put together by the careful mother and preserved as jealously as queen out being kept a charred stick that governed the destiny of her son
as the children arrive at years of discretion these treasures pass out of the mother's faithful keeping into the hands of their actual owners and there usually kept scored away in some little used drawer or cabinet until death removes the necessity for any further safeguards over life

for the greater events of family life the home pots are felt to be too uncertain whom the services of the fortune teller must be called him
no well manna family would think of building a new house without finding in what direction to pace the front door
after this manner has been settled in the houses fairly begun there are occasional crises in its construction upon which much depends
of these the most importance the day when the roof was raised
the house owner then besides whether the day sat by the builder is a lacking one for himself and his family
a present of money teach workmen is also in order and will conduce to the rapid and faithful execution of the job of man when at last the house is finished in carpenters and plasters are ready to leave it the local fireman who have assisted all along in the building as unskilled laborers often ascend to the roof and from the ridgepole cast down cakes for which the children and the neighborhood scrambled joyfully
all come who can and those who cannot come sin servants or provisions
on the day after the death often in the evening the body must be placed in the cask shaped cough un until recently was a style commonly a use in japan
now among the wealthier classes the long coffin has superseded the small square or round one but the smaller expense connected with the burial in the old way makes a survival of an old type a necessity for the majority of japanese
at an appointed time all the relatives assemble in the death chamber and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse
theres no official ceremonial mourning of parents for their children nor does custom require them to perform any of the last rites or attend the funeral
upon the younger brothers and sisters falls the duty of attending to all the last sad ministrations
when the body has been washed is is dressed in white in sil cava tin whenever the family can afford it
the body to be placed in the coffin must be folded into a sitting posture and the chin resting upon the knees the position of the mummies found in many aboriginal american tombs
this difficulty to us apparently impossible feat safely accomplished there are placed in the coffin and number of small things that the dead takes with him to the nest world
the single exception to this rule about metal is that small copp of coins may be put in to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death
last of all the vacant spaces and the coffin are filled in with bags of tea
so long as the coffin is in the house and must be watched over continually
it is their duty to see that the incense burning before the coffin is never allowed to go out while the food for the dead is renewed regular intervals by the mourners themselves
there are few enlightened japanese who will defend the present system of cruelty to the afflicted or who do not long for some change but so great is the force of conservatism in this regard so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack of respect for the dead that reform advances slowly
individual instances occur in which some of the worst features of these customs are modified
a casein point is that of the late mister fuca a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countrymen in modern ways and who in his death continued his teaching
in his will he provided that his body was to be buried without washing in the clothing in which he died
through this growing feeling and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies
just before the procession starts a religious ceremony is held at the house which is attended by the friends of the deceased and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery
what on the day of the burial great bunches of natural flowers are sent to the dead each bunch so large as to require the services of one man to carry it
sometimes with the gift a man is sent to take part in the procession that if the giver fields too poor to hire a man this burden too falls upon the bereaved household for etiquette requires that all flowers sent be born to the grave by uniformed coolies who march in the funeral train
another favorite present at this time among buddhists is a cage of living birds too be born to the grave and released thereon
it seems more like a bridle than a burial
during this period the spirit of the deceased is supposed to be still inhabiting the house and a tablet or shrine is set up in the death chamber before which food and flowers are renewed daily
he tarried at gen ashur a few days and came up the caro where i then resided he was apparently without any business that would support him but he soon became acquainted with my son thomas with whom he hunted for a long time and made his home with him at my house winter came on and he continued his day
the enraged husband well knowing that he should feel a blow if he waited to hear the order repeated instantly retreated and went down the river to his cattle
we protected the poor ant coke woman and gave her victuals and allan sympathized with her in her misfortunes display when her husband came to her acknowledged his former letters and that he had abused her without a cause prom mister reformation and she received him with every mark over renewal of her affection
the indians were soon answered by the american officer that the wampum was s gorgeously accepted and that the continuance of peace was ardently wished for
my son thomas went with them with allan's horse and carried the good
alleyne on finding that his enemies had gone came back to my house where he lived as before but of his return they were soon notified at niagara and nettles who married priscilla ramsey with the small party of indians came on to take him
nettles at length abandoned the chase went home and alleyne all in bathers came in
by running in the woods his clothing had become torn into rags so that he was in a suffering condition almost naked
alleyne made his trousers himself and then built a raft on which he went down the river to his own place at mont maris
there an indian gave him some refreshment and a good gun with which he hastened on to little beards down where he found his cores
not daring to risk himself at that place for fear of being given up he made her but a short visit and came immediately to caro
the love of liberty however added to his natural swiftness gave him sufficient strength to make his escape to his formal castle of safety
his pursuers came immediately to my house whereat they expected to have found him secreted and under my protection
still unsatisfied u doubting my veracity they advised my indian brother to use his influence to draw from me the secret of his concealment which they had ideot that i considered great importance nor only to him but to my sense i persisted in my ignorance of his situation and finally they left me
which he came to my house in the night and awoke me with the greatest caution feeling that some of his enemies might be watching to take him at a time when and in a place where it would be impossible for him to make his escape
at that time allen lay in a secret place in the gulf a short distance above my flats in a hole that he accidentally found in the rope near the river
praise little danger in this court venture so i am me as well be fled with the poor child
ah why not
i hesitated
the letter asking me to visit her was the first i have ever received from her
but since she asked me to visit her we judged she had softened and might wish to become fiendly and so i accepted the invitation

in one corner of the little room kenneth forbes squatted upon a pinch with an empty pine box held carelessly in his lap
while duncan worked the boy was busy with his fences but neither that's spoken for a please a half half
then riding slowly up the hedge bordered road his trubbles once more assailed him and he wondered if there was not some spot upon the broad earth to which he could fly for retirement until the girls had left almost for good
nor rashid and he looked up to discover that he had nearly run down a pedestrian a stout little man with a bundle under his arm who held up one hand as it to arrest him
redd you want to go asked the boy
that is the same jane as ever he responded with a shake of his buzzed head

thank you lad returned the man gratefully i thought a little exercise would do me good but this three mile has seemed like dirty to me

the boy turned away but in a moment halted again
his interest in miss jane's brother john was extraordinary

his own daughter his only daughter of the best blood of southern aristocracy beautiful accomplished everything to secure him a splendid alliance holding knightly assignation with a horse hunter
he could bear concede so much to her caprice since her staying at home could be no disadvantage to the cause that had prompted him to the stern council
it is already known that this road passed the hacienda of casa del corvo at some distance from the house and on the opposite side of the river
on reaching the corpse he dismounted led his horse in among the underwood hitched him by looping his bride grin around the topmost twigs of an e lasting bow then detaching a long rope of twisted horsehair from the horn of his saddest and inserting his arm into its coil he glided out to the edge of the island on that side that lay towards the hacienda
before forsaking the shadow of the corpse he cast a glance towards the sky and at the moon sailing supremely over it
the droll conceit which has so often mused the nocturnal in every of great cities appeared to produce a like effect upon the night patrol of the prairie and for a moment the shadow laid darkening his bow disappeared
it's not likely it is our unless it be the honour of a bad conscience who can't sleep
croft there's one such within those walls
if he be abroad there's a good chance of his see me on the open ground not that i should care straw if it were only myself to be compromised
it's no use waiting upon the moon jaska
it is true he had designs upon the hacienda but these did not contemplate either its cash plate or jewelry if we accept the most precious jeweller contained the mistress of the mansion herself
the church bells were ringing and people on the avenue going by to service turned curious inquiring looks up at the great house and then went on talking with the recent events which had so strangely entered into and made history in the city
and all through his impassioned appeal this morning there was a note of sadness and rebuke and stern condemnation but made many of the members pale with self accusation or with inward anger
raymond had voted to continue for another year the saloon
the christians of raymond stood condemned by the results
for that had been the fact in raymond for years the saloon ruled
president marsh sat there his usual erect handsome firm bright self confident bearing all gone his head bowed upon his breast the great tears rolling down his cheeks unmindful of the fact that never before had he shown outward emotion in a public service
what if he had begun to do as jesus would have done long ago
when had the first church yielded to such a baptism of tears
what had become of its regular precise conventional order of service undisturbed by any vulgar emotion and unmoved by any foolish excitement
what they had been living so long on their surface feelings that they had almost forgotten the deeper wells of life
the meeting was tender it glowed with the spirit's presence it was alive with strong and lasting resolve to begin a war on a whisky power and raiment that would break its rein for ever
since the first sunday when the first company of volunteers had pledged themselves to do as jesus would do the different meetings had been characterized by distinct impulses or impressions
and all through it ran one general cry for deliverance from the saloon in a toff curse
grey and his wife were besieged by inquirers who wanted to know what loring's friends and acquaintances were expected to do in paying their last respects to her
gray had gone up to virginia's and after talking it over with her and maxwell the arrangement had been made
i am and always have been opposed to large public funerals said grey whose complete wholesome simplicity of character was one of its greatest sources of strength but the cry of the poor creatures who knew loreen is so earnest that i did not know how to refuse this desire to see her and pay her poor body some last little honour what do you think mister maxwell
i will be guided by your judgment in the matter
i am sure that whatever you and miss page think best will be right
under the circumstances i have a great distaste for what seems like display at such times but this seems different
it happened that that afternoon a somewhat noted newspaper correspondent was passing through garment on his way to an editorial convention in a neighboring city
she was a common street drunkards and yet the services of the tent were as impressive as any i ever witnessed in a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen
it struck me of course being a stranger in the place with considerable astonishment to hear voices like those one naturally expects to hear only in great churches or concerts at such a meeting as this
mister maxwell spoke of the fact that the dead woman had been fully prepared to go but he spoke in a peculiarly sensitive manner of the effect of the liquor business on the lives of men and women like this one
raymond of course being a railroad town and the center of the great packing interests for this region is full of saloons
then followed what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service
it was one of the simplest and at the same time one of the most impressive sights i ever witnessed
there must have been a hundred of these women and i was told many of them had been converted at the meetings just recently
there was no answer and after one or two ineffectual attempts phronsie turned fearfully away
i'll try and she laid a quick a on the mouth
two red spots burned on her cheeks and her pale blue eyes snapped
i'm sure i heard it raging up and down
i don't want any dinner said charlotte drawing neck
yes indeed said polly cheerily just as fine as can be
assuredly said old mister king with great satisfaction in polly's pleasure and at her success in drawing charlotte out
and after this there were no more quiet days for charlotte chatterton
oh but me too phronsie in pleased surprise
yes grandpapa said phronsie coming in and shutting it are carefully i came on purpose to see you all alone
so you did dear said mister king highly gratified and pushing away his writing table he held out his hand
oh no grandpapa cried phronsie in a rapture i could never be too big for that so she perched up as if old on his knee then she folded her hands and looked gravely in his face
well my dear what is it
asked the old gentleman presently you've come to tell me something i suppose
yes grandpapa i have said phronsie decidedly and it is most important too glad papa oh i do wish it so much and she clasped her hands tighter inside
well then phronsie if you want it i suppose it must be said mister king quite as a matter of course
oh she loft you everything she had fondly a couple of millions or so it is why
charlotte poor repeated the old gentleman
why no not exactly her father is rich but charlotte i think they do very well especially as i intend to keep her here for awhile and then i shall never let her suffer phronsie never indeed
grandpapa said phronsie wasn't missus chatterton aunt to charlotte
if missus chatterton was aunt de charlotte persisted phronsie slowly it seems as if charlotte ought to have some of the money it really does grandpapa
maybe said the old gentleman with a short laugh and i shouldn't wonder if cousin eunice was sorry over a few other things too phronsie
wouldn't it make her very glad if i gave shall let some of the money
for answer mister king set her down hastily on the floor and took two or three turns up and down the room
oh i do so wish i might she said there's so much for a little girl like me
it will be so nice to have charlotte half some with me still no answer
i was writing a note to missus fargo said phronsie putting up her lips for a kiss
sure as i can be phronsie said old mister king smiling good bye dear
there there my sister's boy shall never say that but come in come in
not to be ungracious the young man threw himself into a chair
i'll hang it uncle why can't you let me alone
which is a wonder interpolated pickering
i know you did uncle said pickering you've done everything that's good
for heaven's sake pickering cried his uncle darting in front of the chair and its restless ouch p don't say that again
i've been a lazy dog all my life and good for nought but i hope i've not sunk to that
the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous fresh of a starry eyed flush cheeked young woman who demanded
where is he pete miss billy gasped the old man
aunt hanna's cheeks too were flushed and her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way pete had said miss billy's name
it was one matter for her to object to this thing billy was doing but quite another for pete to do it of course it's she
retorted aunt hanna testily as if you yourself didn't bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night pete where is he
interposed billy tell mister bertram i'm here or wait i'll go right in in surprise it
pete had recovered himself by now but he did not even glance toward aunt hannah
miss billy miss billy you're an angel straight from heaven you are you are oh i'm so glad you came
it'll be all right now all right he's the den miss billy
billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall aunt hanna's indignant voice arrested her billy stopped
pete go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receive us pete's lips twitched
but his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke
a flying figure brushed by him and fell on its seas by the couch with a low cry bertram's eyes flew open
don ling found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over bertram's tray
in the hall above aunt hannah was crying into william's gray when and duster that hung on the hall rack aunt hanna's handkerchief was on the floor back at hillside
then very gradually it dawned over them that there was after all something strange and unexplained at it all
as if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closer bertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable
why of course stammered billy i couldn't help thinking that maybe you had found out you didn't want me
demanded bertram angry a mystified
as for my not painting again you didn't understand pete deary
she pulled herself half away from bertram's in circling arm
billy do you're quivering sigh
good heavens is kate and this too bertram's voice was savage now
well she brought a letter
billy laughed gayly but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes
and you never did think for a minute billy that she cared for him
he had not been slow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids
billy was so glad bertram had turned the question on her love instead of arkwright
after a minute billy stirred and sighed happily
you see i wasn't in love with mister arkwright
an and you didn't care speciall be for for miss wink up
billy put a soft finger on his lips
bertram kissed the finger and subsided huh he commented
well what is that is that kate too demanded bertram grimly
there was another silence then suddenly bertram stirred
billy i'm going to marry you to morrow he announced decisively
i don't know as i can trust you out of my sight till then you'll read something or hear something or get a letter from kate after breakfast tomorrow morning that will set you saving me again and i don't want to be saved that way
i'm going to marry you to morrow i'll get he stopped short with a sudden frown c found that law i forgot
five days indeed sir
i wonder if you think i can get ready to be married in five days
don't want you to get ready retorted bertram promptly i saw marie it ready and i had all i wanted of it
if you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace ruffling will do it afterwards not before but
besides i need you to take care of me cut in bertram craftily
the tender glow on billy's face told its own story and bertram's eager eyes were not slow to read it
sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm
billy my dear
it was aunt hannah's plaintive voice at the doorway a little later
we must go home and william is here too and wants to see you
you mean that'll be before october
aunt hanna glanced from one to the other uncertainly
yes nodded billy demurely
yes i know that is a good while cut in bert marly
we wanted it to morrow what we had to wait on account of the new license law
yet so strong was the effect upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectation of the wood which should make him rich
a part of that impression was due to be engagement which he must now fulfil
to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes
because in his salad days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many chance step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that raw attachment
unable to think of work he left the house and wandered gloomily about regent's park
he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marian who was fate's instrument
he wrote to marian
will you let me hear or come and see
i scarcely thought of beforn is likely to kill himself
but why the chuse did he go all the way out there
i hoped he would bred me some years
poverty i can only suppose
but i will see wh dle i hadn't come across effort tee
was he still so very poor
asked amy compassionately
i've afraid sigh his book failed utterly
oh if i had imagined him still in such distress surely i might have done something to help you
perchance his death was in part attributable to that hopeless love
he sent me a copy of his novel she said and i saw him once or twice after that
having this subject to converse upon put the two more quickly at ease than could otherwise have been the case
amy might take a foremost place among wilding women
especially now that her father is threatened with blindness
is it so serious
even if mister yule recovers his side it is not at all likely that he will be able to work as before
our difficulty is a so grave that
he paused and let his hand fail despondently
i have a good deal of will you remember and what i have set my mind upon no doubt i shall some day achieve
there was silence
the last three years he continued have made no slight difference in my position
recall where i stood when you first newly
just now i am in need of a little encouragement
you don't notice any falling off in my work recently
do you see my things in the current and so on generally
sometimes i believe i have detected you when there was no signature
her storing in that girl's paper has attracted attention
and i could so easily put her rest by renouncing all claim upon her
i surmise that that you yourself would also be put rest by such a decision
john look at me with that ironical smile he pleaded
i couldn't know about declaring that i was heartbroken in any event i must be contempt for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgements are pretty sure to be unfavorable what can i do
the case is too delicate by fear for my advice
well i'll get back to my script
again just beheld the white soft handed for a superfluous moment
yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry
marian could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companion's smooth countenance
she had divined that there were some grave reason for this son's and the painting with which she approached was half caused by the anxious beats of her heart
he began abruptly
he gave her such details as he had obtained then added
there are two of my companions fallen in the battle
i ought to think myself a lucky fellow marry what
you are better fitted to fight your way jasper
more of a greatly main
here no very well i don't
i have made up my mind about our affairs he went on presently
yes
will you marry them and let us take their chains
you feel yourself indispensable to your father at present
i should be so afraid of the effect upon his health jasper
she paused and looked up at him touchingly
dear i can't feel it would be my duty to renounce you because my father had become blind
has one thing occurred to you
will he consent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is missus milby
and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him
she listened anxiously and reflected
as i have said there is a very serious doubt whether your father would accept money for you when you were my wife
it isn't your fault marian and well then there's only one thing to do
except jasper that a father is helpless i must find means of assuring his support
d you think them insurmountable
that is just what i have decided his impossible now you you shall have the plain truth
i don't trust myself
but shall you face them willingly
put up your umbrella marian
what do i care for a drop of reign she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is at stake how am i to understand you
every word you speak seems intended to dishearten me
why need you conceal it if that is the truth
is that what you mean by sighing you distrust yourself
we must see each other again marian
how am i to live an hour in such uncertainty as this
i do wish it
her emotion had an effect on him and his voice trembled
there is no natural war that a child should surrender everything for her parents
you know so much more of the world than i did can't you advise me
is there no way of provoking for my father
good god this is frightful marian i can't stand it
i will be faithful to you
he had made a pretence of holding his umbrella over her but marian turned away and walked to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a great tree her face averted from him
moving to follow he saw that her fame was shaken by soundless sobbing
in what can there be more selfishness
but i couldn't say a word that would seem to invite such misery as this
you don't love me jasper at that an end of everything
happiness or misery come to us by a fight
is it in my power to make you happy
but if you had said you loved me before that i should have it always to remember
if i believe anything i believe that i did love you
what can you say to me more than you have said now
remember me as a man who disregarded priceless loves such as yours to go and make himself a proud position among fools and knaves indeed that one's come to
soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merited my perverse pride would revolt against it
what can be simpler than the truth
it is a thing that happens every day either in a man or woman and all what honoured demands is the courage to confess the truth
marian will you do this will you let her engagement last for another sixth months but without her meeting during that time
that seems to me childish
the rain fell unceasingly and with it began to mingle an autumnal mist
jess but delight a moment then asked calmly
are you going to the museum yes
don't home again for this morning marian you can't work
i must and i have no time to lose
good by she gave him her hand
they looked at each other for an instant then marian left the shelter of the tree opened her umbrella and walked quickly away
jasper did not watch her he had the face of a man who was suffering a severe humiliation
his sister said very little for she recognized genuine suffering in his times an aspect
a few weeks ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest affection but who is very rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him
yesterday morning he received her final answer by refusal
you will understand they surely you need no fresh proof how utterly unworthy he is of you
you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you
what several days passed before there came a reply
i must only ask that you will write to me without the least reference to these troubles tell me always about yourself and be sure that you cannot tell me too much
we had then but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of the covenant which was requisite for determination of the problem
several different parties were therefore organized to examine the various routes supposed to be practicable within the northern end southern limits of the united states
the only discrimination mate was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the surveys
he inquiries were made with regard to gun powder which subsequently led to the use of a coarser brain for artillery
the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service in the regular army and party by appointment from civil wife
under instructions from the president the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution
after some further discussion of the question the visitors withdrew dissatisfied with the result of the interview
a quartermaster general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake and the appointed to the office had been confounded with his father who was a well known whig but that he the son was a democrat
i assured the general that this was altogether immaterial adding that it was a very pretty quarrel as it stood and that i had known a desire to effect a settlement of it on any inferior issue
nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the foxhound a very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size
if you want to hunt your has on foot sixteen inches is quite big enough almost too big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches is a useful height or even nineteen inches
it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule asked color it is so much a matter of individual taste
but puppies are usually sent out to walk and may easily be procured to be captain reared until they are old enough to be hindered to their work
he is of course finer but with the length of neck so perfect in the bigger hound the little shoulders of the same pattern and the typical quarters and second flies
and when he is fairly on a line of course he sticks to it as the saying is is like a beagle
it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otter hound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of good eighteen inches and an almost identical contemporary that was called the essex beagle
that a great many of the true order were bred became very manifest as soon as the harrier and beagle association was formed and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hound show was reserved for the
then they seemed to sprinkle every part of the country
one hears now of the carstone the housed place very noted indeed the hal toon the lee park the stoke place the edinburgh the surbiton the trinity foot the wood dale missus j dug hilliard missus price's and missus turners

all things which follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of god must always exist and be infinite or in other words are each carnal and infinite through the said attribute
proof conceive if it be possible supposing the proposition to be denied that something in some attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of the said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought
in its nature infinite
must necessarily exist
we have now granted therefore thought not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of god does not naturally follow from its nature can so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of god which is against our apotheosis
and beyond the limits of the duration of the idea of god supposing the latter at some time not to have existed for not to be going to exist thought would perforce have existed without the idea of god which is contrary to our hypothesis for we suppose that thought being given the idea of god necessarily flowed therefrom
bear in mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from god's absolute nature
corollary hence it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is in's classic phraseology god is cause of the being of things as sandy rem
corollary individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of god or modes by which the attributes of god are expressed in a fixed and definite manner
such a call such a time you never did see
i was wishing somebody would give the conversation a start when indiana made a break
this ain't no great stock country says he to the old gentleman with the can

there's very little grazing here and the range is pretty much were out
the young lady smiled through her veil and the old lady snapped her eyes and looked sideways at the speaker

swearing says the old preacher is a terrible bad practice and there ain't no use in it nohow

never mind polly said jasper there's all next summer and after our winter and dresden and all our hard work over music wouldn't be fine those of jaunt round again and his eyes glistened
and you'll go on drawing and painting till you get to be a great artist ran on polly enthusiastically and then we'll see something you've done and the loose maybe the loo cried adela oh dear me polly pepper
tom selwyn had been very sober during all this merry chatter and now in his seat across the narrow aisle he drummed his heels impatiently on the floor
what's up little mother asked tom in surprise at her unusual manner it says this tom
when the news was circulated as it was pretty soon that the party was not to be broken into it all till paris was a completed story the jubilation was such as to satisfy even tom
oh isn't it oates peas beams and barley girl cried polly as they watched them intently
and his long arm went out and picked a jack an end of an urchin who incautiously regarding such quiet travellers as not worth minding had hovered too near while trying to tease the girls
and presently a woman came and took little blue pinafore off and then the rest of the girls unclasped their hands and the ring melted away and the game was over
i'm glad the girl's over here half fun said polly as grandpapa and his party moved off isn't it nice to think they do
two or three days of rest at martini put everyone in good shape and gave them all a bit of time to pick up on many little things that were behindhand
that's my third letter polly announced jasper on the other side of the table now i'm going to begin on tools
one two said polly counting why i thought i'd written three well this one is most finished jasper
dare said tom delighted to think that no terrible result had really ensued from his words that after they were out had scared him mightily
i'll poster us to polly give them here
then his face brightened and he said and she's right polly while polly fished a rag out of jellous little money bag that hung in her belt
do get the stamps pleased jasper and put them on and he took up her two letters and she gave the bag a little pat for jewel's sake wishing it was his stubby black hair that her fingers could touch
i don't know where we are going to get nice white paper f around robin said polly leaning her alpha and her chin in her hands i know ejaculated tom whirling on his heel and dashing out
i want polly to said phronsie wriggling away from the pen that polly held out alluringly
phronsie who hadn't heard what polly said her small head being full of the responsibility of beginning the important letter and considering since it was to be done it was best to have it over with as soon as possible felt a scribbling a letters as fast as she could all them running downhill
it's all right grand adele like it he said
i tell you you don't know my grandaddy he's got lots of fun in him he added
i won't cry any more declared phronsie wiping off the last tear trailing down the nose
then i shall be all as well as ever said polly kissing the wet little face
we must put in little pictures said polly trying to make herself cheery as the work went busily on
poy you always do think of the best things exclaimed jasper beaming at her which made her try harder than ever to smile
i wouldn't feel so badly polly he managed to a spur when phronsie was absorbed with her work fell i could probably just as father did the kinch bread boy
he seems to accomplish something every time he goes observed jasper drily hello just look at him now
oh dear me exclaimed adela as her scissors slipped now you juggled the table again then she caught polly's eye
rather not much obliged tom bobbed his thanks
picture after picture cut from railroad di books illustrated papers and it seemed to jasper gathered as if by magic with cunning little photographs broke up the letter and wound in and out with funny and charming detail of some of their journey
the rest of it is nice whispered jasper and i ventured to say that ill like that the best of all
mister king thought so too and he beamed it phronsie so you did he cried now that's fine i wish you'd write me a letter sometime
but what can i do so small and stupid and shy as i am
i must find some way to give the little ones a ice christmas
tom i will like to have me go with him and sing while he places harp in the streets
yes i will try and then if i do well the little one shall have a merry christmas
but see then it is cold in the streets the wind bites and the snow freezes one's stingers
she thanked tom and ran away to get ready for she felt sure her father would not please her anything
then she washed out little rance's frock and put it to dry because she would not be able to do it the next day
she longed to make the beds and dress the children overnight she was in such a hurry to have all in order but as that could not be she sat down again and tried over all the songs she knew
when she had told her plan peter bardi shook his head and thought it would never do p tessa begged so hard he consented at last that she should try it for one a week and sent her to bet the happiest little girl in new york
as soon as her father was gone tessa flew about and put everything in nice order telling the children she was going out for the day and they were to mind tom was mother who would see about the fire and the dinner for the good woman left tessa and entered into her little plans with all her heart
poor tess's heart beat fast as she trudged away with tommo who slung his harp over his shoulder and gave her his hand
it was rather a dirty hand but so kind that tessa clung to it and kept looking up at the friendly brown face for encouragement
see now have no fear give them bell monica that is marian will make the laugh whispered tommo tuning hiss huck
when faddle french but nodded to her and it seemed to help her very much for she began to sing before she thought and that was the hardest part of it
but too shook if curly hat and answered soberly yes i took you there first for they love music and are off our country but up among the great houses we shall not always do well
but she had made half a dollar for tum of divided and money fairly and she felt rich with her share
her hands were covered with chilblains where she had no mittens but she had put them under her shawl and shuffled merrily away in her big boots feeling so glad that the week was over and nearly three dollars safe in her pocket
how gave the streets were that day
how brisk everyone was and how bright the faces looked as people trotted about with big baskets holly wreaths and young evergreens going to blossom into splendid christmas trees
but i can't so i'll fill the socks all full and be happy said tessa as she looked wistfully into the gay stores and saw the heavy baskets go by
who knows what may happen if we do well returned tommo nodding wisely for he had planned as well as tessa and kept chuckling over it as he trudged through the mud
will try one more street and then go home thou'rt so tired little one
at the fourth some people at them sing all their songs and gave nothing
tessa felt so grateful that without waiting for tommo she sang her sweetest little song all alone
last mamma said rose and away she went into the dining room close by
as the door opened tessa seul what looked to her like a fairy feast all silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine and tall glass pitchers and smoking dishes that smelt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfaction
ah yes i shall come with much gladness and play us never in my life before cried tommo with a flourish of the old cap that made the children laugh
give these to your brothers said the fairy prince stuffing nuts and oranges into tests hands
ah so kind so very kind i have no way to say thank you but runs as shall be for you a heavenly angel and i will sing my heart out for your treat cried chef folding the mittens as if she would say a prayer of thankfulness if she knew how
she got up early to see if the socks were all right and there she found the most astonishing sight
four socks instead of three and by the fourth pinned out quite elegantly was a little dress evidently meant for her o warm woollen dress all made and actually with bright buttons on it
tessa screamed and danced in her delight and up tumbled all the children to scream and dance with her making a regular carnival in it small scale
in her long stocking she found all sorts of treasures for pummel had stuffed it full of queer things and his mother had made gingerbread into every imaginable shape from fat pigs to full omnibuses
little rance was accepted with delight by the kind lady of her children and tessa learn the song quite easily
arose from the crowd of children gathered to the festival
before they went home the kind mamma told tessa she should be her friend and gave her motherly kiss which warm the child's heart and timed to set a p seal upon that promise
the senator took his seat in the pulpit with the minister on one side of him and the superintendent of the sunday school on the other
so odd were they by the presence of a living united states senator that during three minutes not a spit ball was thrown
after that they began to come to themselves by degrees and presently the spell was wholly gone and they were reciting verses and polly hare
the usual sunday school exercises were hurried through and then the minister got up and board the house with a speech built on the customary sunday school plan then the superintendent put in his oar then the town dignitaries had their side
am i am some populous centre of my own country were the choicest children of the land have been selected and brought together as at a fair for a prize no
then where am i yes where am i
my soul is lost in wonder at the thought
earth has no higher no grander position for me
then what is it what did my consciousness reply
ah think of that now i could hardly keep the tears back i was so grateful
they could not give him a costly education but they were good and wise and they sent him to the sunday school he loved the sunday school
i hope you love your sunday school ah i see by your faces that you do that is right
always love your teachers my children for they love you more than you can know now
and by and by the people made him governor and he said it was all owing to the sunday school
why the people gave him a towering illustrious position a grand imposing position
it was senator of the united states
that poor little boy that loved his sunday school became that man that man stands before you
above all things my children be honest
when c or dilworthy departed from cattle bille he left three dozen boys behind him arranging a campaign of life whose objective point was the united stat senate
well much go as a delightful child
there was no other such child there never had been and there never would be
while let's mother ser female alexandrovna was sure of that
loch his eyes were dark and large her cheeks are rosy her lips were made for kisses and for laughter
but it was not these charms and le lech get that gave her mother the keenest joy
she felt cold with her husband
he was always fresh and cool with a frigid smile and wherever he passed cold currents sink move in the air
it even seemed at sarama alexandrovna that she was in love with her future husband and this made her happy
the bride was also good looking she was a tall dark eyed dark haired girl somewhat she made but very tactful
he had connections and his wife came a good influential people
this might at the proper opportunity prove useful
after their marriage there was nothing in the manner of sir louvois to suggest anything wrong to his wife
later however when his wife was about to have a child sergey wostov established connections elsewhere of a light and temporary nature
spa alexandrovna found the couch and to her own astonishment was not particularly hurt she awaited her infant with a restless anticipation that swallowed every other feeling
spa alexandrovna drifted farther and farther away from him
ulv ga then ran away stamping with her plump little legs over the carpets and hid herself behind the curtains near her bed
where is my baby girl the mother asked if she looked for l loth ga may believe that she did not see her
then she came out a little farther and her mother as though she had only just caught sight of her seized her by her little shoulders and exclaimed joyously here she is my lo let ga
her mother's eyes glowed with passionate emotion
her mother went to hide
folett turned away as though not to see but watch shema mashka stealthily all the time
where's ma mocha as l
a smile of absolute bless played on her red lips
lul thatch goes getting nearer her mother's corner
her mother was growing more absorbed every moment by her interest in the game her heart beat with short quick strokes and she pressed even closer to the wall disarranging her hair still more
l lech ca suddenly glanced toward her mother's corner and screamed with joy
through the half closed doors he heard the laughter the joyous outcries the sound of romping
even fedosya felt abashed now for her mistress now for herself
he liked coming here where everything was beautifully arranged this was done by seraphim alexandrovna who wished to surround her little girl from her very infancy only with the loveliest things
seraph ma ulex and dona dressed herself tastefully this too she did for l latch goa with the same end in view
one thing sergey modoc had not become reconciled to and this was his wife's almost continuous presents in the nursery
it's just as i thought i knew that i'd find you here he said with a deserving condescending smile
merely you see that the child should feel its own individuality he explained in answer to seraphim out suna's puzzled plants
she still so little said seraphim alexandrovna
i don't insist it's your kingdom here
i think it over his wife answered smiling as he did coldly but genially
then they began to talk of something else
that mistress does it while that's one thing but that the young lady does it that's bad
why asked fedosya of curiosity
this expression of curiosity gave her face the look of a wooden roughly painted doll
yes that's bad repeated agatho with conviction terribly bad well
it's the truth i'm saying remember my word agatha went on with the same assurance and secrecy
it's the sheerest sign
the old woman had invented this sign quite suddenly herself and she was evidently very proud of it
madame madam she said quietly in a trembling voice
ser forma alexandrovna gave a start
f doc's face made her anxious
what is it fedosya she asked with great concern is there anything wrong with lulla
no madam said fedosya she gesticulated with her hands to reassure her mistress and to make her sit down
but latch does asleep may god be with her
only you'd like to say something you see well much g always hiding herself that is not good
i can't tell you how bad it is said fedosya and her face expressed the most decided confidence
i understand nothing of what you are saying
you see madam ms a kind of omen explained fedosya abruptly and the shamefaced way
nonsense said seraph ma alexandrovna
who told you all this as seraphim ma alexandrovna in in austere low voice
no exclaimed seraphim alexandrovna's irritation as though she wished to protect herself somehow from the sudden anxiety
what nonsense as though the lunch good could die
she saw clearly that there could be no possible connection between a child's quite ordinary diversion and the continuation of the child's life
she made a special effort that evening to occupy her mind with other matters but her thoughts turn and voluntarily the facts that wil latch ca love to hide herself
when the lunch ga was still quite small and had learned to distinguished between her mother and her nurse she sometimes sitting in her nurse's arms made a sudden rubbish grimace and hid her laughing face and the nurse's shoulder
then she would look out with a sly glass
though she reproached herself at once for this unfounded superstitious dread nevertheless she could not enter wholeheartedly into the spirit wil lath ga a's favorite game and she tried to divert lulu's attention to something else
she eagerly complied with their mother's new wishes
seraph ma alexandrovna tried desperately to amuse gloat ga
perhaps th seraph ma alexandrovna she is not as strongly drawn to the world as other children who attracted by many things
if this is so is it not a sign of organic weakness
serf mad syro una herself began the game once or twice there she played it with a heavy heart
she suffered as though committing an evil deed with full consciousness
it was a sad day for seraph alexandrovna
her mother covered her with a blue blanket
will loth ca drew her sweet little hands from under the blanket and stretched them atter embrace her mother her mother bent down
she seemed so small and so frail under the pointed that covered her
ser paa alexandrovna remained standing over lilt ea's bed a long while and she kept looking at w latch ga with tenderness and fear
i'm a mother is it possible that i shouldn't be able to protect her she thought as she imagined various ills that might befal aha
she prayed long that night but the prayer did not relieve her sadness
several days passed will lunch cot coal
the fever came upon her at night
when seraphim alexandrovna awakened by fedosya came to lunch gun saw her looking so hot so restless and so tormented she instantly recalled the evil omen and a hope was dispirited possession of her from the first moments
a doctor was called and everything was done that as usual on such occasions but the inevitable happened
and l luca grew feebler from hour to
nothing made her so unhappy as the reiteration of fedosya uttered between subs she hid herself and hid herself are lilla
fever was consuming role ga and there were times when she lost consciousness and spoke in delirium
three days passed torturing like a night man
ser forma alexandrovna hid her face behind the curtains near latch bea's bed how tragic
a wait mocha whispered woloda
mom much bea's white face became blurred and everything grew dark before lola
she met her husband
sila alexandrovna was standing by the coffin and looking dully at her dead child
cyma my dear don't agitate yourself said sergeant moto
you must resign yourself to your fate
she'll be up in a minute persisted ser female alexandrovna her eyes fixed on the dead little girl
sergey loads stoving looked round him cautiously he was afraid of the unseemly and of the ridiculous
sea don't agitate yourself he repeated
he was confused and annoyed
her face seemed tranquil and her eyes were dry
she went into the nursery and began to walk round the room looking into those places where ll ask used to hide herself
she walked all about the room and bent now and then to look under the table or under the bed and kept on repeating cheerfully where's my little one where is my loath ga
after she had walked round the room once she began to make her quest in you
fedosya motionless with dejected face sat in a corner and looked frightened at her mistress then she suddenly burst out sobbing and she wailed loudly
she hid herself and hid herself are the latch guy at angelic little soul
when she entered the parlor there were several people between her and ilka
there was an oppressive feeling of heaviness and seraph ma alexandrovna's head as she approached ll thatch ga
we'll much go lay there still impale and smile pathetically
the little one did not reply
seraphim alexandrovna stood up erect sight in a lost way smiled and called loudly fleck
while much goes being carried out
captain bull the commander of a small garrison at se brook permitted him to land but when the governor began to read his commission bull ordered him to be silent
what has happened mister prince was worth asked for he could see that the man was greatly excited governor andrews has come again gasped mister prince why should that alarm us the fellow though get into boasting is not dangerous or liable to point his threats into execution but he has grown dangerous declared mister prince the liberties of the colony are involved
captain wadsworth became a little uneasy though he was still inclined to treat the matter lightly
we have surely refused to yield our charge voluntarily for it is the guardian of our political rights
that is true cup and wadsworth continued mister prince and to subdue our stubbornness this v story has come to hartford with sixty earn men to demand the surrender of the charter in person
captain was with bounded to his feet in a rage and placing his hand on the hilt of his sword declared he shall not have it
the day was well nice spent when he arrived and the members were engaged in a heated debate on a subject of the utmost importance
he consented however to await the discussion but as soon as it was ended he declared that he would have the charter
after that captain had taken two or three turns across the room he paused and asked
what is the assembly doing engaged in debate
and will he wait until it is ended he has promised to do so
mister prince fixed his amazed eyes on the captain's face and read their desperate determination captain he again
mister prince bowed and hastily returned to the house where the assembly was in session
as soon as he was gone charles ked and said
yes charles you will answer what do you mean uncle
never did debaters take greater interest in a minor subject
what do you intend doing uncle will you fight them
remember the worth must be done right at the time mt tun nor too late
the sun was setting and the captain said
come charles let us hasten to the assembly
by no means but i want you to be fully impressed with the seriousness of your mission
take your place charles and be prepared to do your part whispered captain wadsworth
charles god is close to the long table used by the secretaries is possible without attracting special attention
the discussion went on darkness came and four lighted candles were placed on the table in two set on a shelf on the wall
those two candles on the wall were a great annoyance to charles until he saw a man station near them
though the lights were extinguished through the window the faint starlit dimly illuminated the scene
he followed him as rapidly as he could
the youth was cloth behind him and when they were outside used his arm
oh i have a care how you approached me
the soldiers began the crowd about the house when at a signal from capting wadsworth the train bents came on the scene and prepared to grapple with the soldiers
where is the charter
you have your soldiers at the door and we have the trainbands of connecticut ready to defend us against violence
who of you has the charter
it was the boy ching range governor
every member of the assembly shook their heads
we do not know him he does not looking communicate where does she live
little did the captain or his youthful assistant dream that their simple act would make the old tree historic
the tree in which the document was hitting was ever afterwards known as charter oak
it remained vigorous bearing fruit every year until a little after midnight august eighteen fifty sixth when it was prostrated by a heavy storm of wind
when the order from the seizure of the charters was first made known the assembly rural and sent a most loyal agis to the king sang
he formerly dissolved the assembly broke the seal of the colony which bore the figure of an anchor and the word hope and made it five in the inhabitants into his legislative council and assumed the function of governor but he did not take away the parchment on which the charter was written
from that time until the fourth union of the colonies for mutual defense at the bursting out the friends in indian war the inhabitants of rhode island or their share in the defensive efforts especially when the hostile savages hung along their trenches in new york like an ill omened cloud
the history is that commonwealth is identified with that of all new england from the beginning of king william's war soon after the expulsion of andrews
colbert who had heard his uncle getting ready to run down to the water's edge
it's a schooner said mister bingham to mister minted and she is a very heavy cargo
to this cord was fastened a heavy rope or table
what's that board for aspirant as he saw board following the teale
that's the directions said how
they are printed in a number of languages and they tell the crew to carry the end of the key will high up to mast and fastened it strongly there
oh i see said berg the lang will stretch then and the breeches bully will go out on a pulley
it was clear day nail and much of the wicked storm had passed
with the daylight came girls and women to the beach
missus bobbsey missus minturn nellie and her mother besides dorothy at m'am were all there flossie and freddy being obliged to stay home with dinah and susan
of course the girls asked all sorts of questions and burton how tried to answer them as best they could
it seemed a long time before any movement of the cable showed that the buoy was returning
nearer and nearer it came until now a man's head could be seen
the girls and women were too frightened to talk and nellie clung close to her mother
a big roller dashing and finished the work for the lice birds and a man in the corbo banded upon shore
everybody gathered around and nelly with a strange face and a stranger hope broke through the crowd to see the rescued man
oh it is my father she screamed falling right into the arms of the drenched man
but the half droned man rubbed his eyes as if he could not believe them then the next minute he pressed his little daughter to his heart unable to speak a word
and as george bring him out there anxiously asked the brother
safe and well can the welcome answer
i guess our prayers were heard last night
here comes another man exclaimed the people as this time a big man dashed on sands
while i declared we did land on a friendly shore
just as mister bingham said though my saving work turned out to be a social affair for there was a great time greeting nell's father in howe's uncle
and how on his father too put in man
what a morning that was at sunset beach
i'm so glad we prayed said little flossie to freddy when she heard good names
a beautiful day had grown out of the dreadful storm
and everybody was so happy
the neptune the vessel that had struck on the sand far was now safely anchored near shore and the sailors came in and out in rowboats back and forth to land just as they wished
then we had to go back to work at the logs went on the captain and then one of our crew took a fever
that was what galena so
finally we had every wall glowed on the schooner and we started off
we canted on daring home last week when this last storm struck us and drove us out of our course
about the value asked mister bobbsey who was downed from the city
the value repeated the captain aside so that the strangers may not hear
or while i am a rich man now and so is my mate mc g ruin for that wood was contracted for by the largest and richest piano firm in this country and now it is all but delivered to them and the money in our hands
yes indeed it would have taken us a lifetime to king late as much money as we have earned in a shear
maybe aunt emily will take you down to the city on her shopping tour suggested nan
he made the clerks them above all the trucks from the isles and i guessed everybody was glad the army fell down
the wonderful fresh air that these men lived in night and day had brightened their eyes too so that even the plainest face and the most awkward man among them was as nimble as an athlete from his perfect exercise
i don't know how to say good by to you nellie told dorothy and m next morning
oh that will be splendid declared nan
you are quite rich now aren't you remarked dorothy
and dorothy went up and down the room like the pictures of cinderella's proud sisters
and we will be on hand thank you replied the joking dorothy
come nellie called missus maclaughlan i'm ready where's your hat
we might be able to manage that too nellie told him
my uncle is a fireman and he can take us through his engine house
most of them i guess answered berg
well we have had a good vacation and i'm willing to go to work again
so am i declared nan vacation was just long and that i think
mister bobbsey was down from the city of course to take the family home and now all hands even freddy and flossie were busy packing up
there were the shells to be looked after the fish nets besides downy the duck and smooth the cat
and so our little friends had spent all their vacation
his characters get john called a mad with jealousy of fallen epileptic fits all rave hysterically
if dostoevsky had had less vision he would have been strindberg
like them he is a novelist of torture
certainly the last of cruelty the lusted destruction for destruction's sake is the most conspicuous of the deadly sins in dostoevsky's men and women
he may not be a cruel also
but they are never in balance they are always in demoniac or complete
even the last is never hardly ever the lust of a more or less sane man
dostoevsky could not have described the sin of nekhludoff in resurrection
this is a madhouse cries someone insidious
one resulted this is a multiplicity of action
even the talk is ill actions more than her by years
he saw is violent deeds not with the hand but with the suck
but one had noticed during this last two days that the other was wearing a silver watch on a yellow bead chain which he seems not to have seen on him before
he took a knife and when his friend had turned away he approached him cautiously from behind took aim turned his eyes heavenwards crossed himself and praying fervently god forgive me for christ's sake
he never paints every man he always projects dostoevsky or a nightmare dostoevsky
that is why climb and punishment belongs to a lower range of fiction than any karenina or fathers and sons
we sympathize indeed with the fears the bravado that despair that succeed the crime
he is a grotesque made alive by sheer imaginative intensity in passion
one does not grudge an artist and abnormal character or two
he invented vicious greatest as dickens evins comic greatest
was very fond of hanging cuts and burying them with great ceremony
as for the karamazovs themselves he betrays the old father and the oldest of his sons hating each other and fighting like brut maniacs
serve him ripe shouted dmitri breathlessly
if i haven't killed him i'll come again and kill him
he is easy to see why dostoevsky has become a popular author
no melodramatic ever poured out incident upon the stage from such a horn of plenty
dostoevsky is always ready to show them all in at once
on two opposite pages of the idiot one finds the following characters brought in by name general a puncheon prince s adelaida ivanovna lizaveta procopius yevgeny pavlovitch r dons cy princess berquin ski a glare prince miskin qui vulcan ippolit va fergus schenk nastasya philipovna nina alexandrovna gon ya ten n general i vulcan
but the secret of dostoevsky's appeal is something more than the multitude and thrill of his incidents and characters
mister murry ball did faces a difficulty and attempts of definition
to him tars sky's work is the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life it is more than a record of a struggle it is for struggle itself
and those voices take shape in certain unforgettable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly mean tavern certain surrounding darkness
ultimately they are the creations not of a man who desired to be but of a spirit which sought to know
because they have possessed they are no longer men and women
this is all in a measure true
to say this is not to deny the spirit of content of dust es is work the anguish of the imprisoned souls at battles with doubt and denial and despair
there is in dostoevsky a suggestion of caliban trying to discover some better god than sir tables
the ultimate attitude of dostoevsky is as christian as the apostle peter's lord i believe helped their my unbelief
and beyond the dark night of suffering and dissipating the night gars sky still seized the light of christian compassion
or even by the compassion of others like prince miskin in the idiot
his work like his face bears the mark of this terrible conflict
the novels of the perfect image of the man
as to the man himself the vicomte dees baggy described him as he saw him in the last years of his life
when he became excited on a certain point one could have sworn that one had seen him before seated i mention a police court awaiting trial or among vagabonds who passed their time begging before the prison doors
at all other times he carried that look of sad and gentle meekness seen on the images of old saving saints
thus a portrait of the men one sees behind austere sky's novels the portrait one might almost have inferred from the novels
it is a figure that it once fascinates and repels
he is not by temperament a singer
his music is a still small voice unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and storm
truth to tell mister hardy is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet
he does not express life easily in beautiful words or in images
thus he writes in i found her out there of one who
there could not be an ugly and more prosaic saturation that is contained in the image in the last line
and prose in tides in the choice of words as well as in images
take for example dears of the word domiciled in the passage in the same palm about
when we as strangers sought their catering care veiled smiles bespoke their thought of what we were
catering care is in appalling phrase
is a line of good poetry
you did not come in marching time drew on and warm me numb yet lost for loss of your dear presence there than that i thus found lacking in your make that higher compassion which can overbear reluctance for pure loving kindness sake grieve die when is the hobo strok it some you did not come
there are hints of the grand style of lyric poetry in these lines but phrases luck in your make and as the hope hour stroked its song are discords that brett tumbling to the levels of victorian commonplace
he has a temperament sensitive beyond that of all but a few recent writers to the pain and passion of human beings
one can remember palm after poem of his with a theme that might easily have served for mister hardy too late christina the lost mistress the last ride together the statue and the bust to name a few
but what a sense of child there is in brownie's tragedies
his will is a place of opulence not of poverty
to have loved in for an hour is with browning to live forever after in the inheritance of a mighty achievement
to have loved for an hour ears in mister hardy's imagination to have deepened the sadness even more than the beauty of one's memories
for then i u distressed by hearts growing cold to me could lonely wait my embers rest with equanimity
but time to make me grieve part steals let's part abide and shakes this fragile frame at eve with throbbings of noontide
and despair is by no means triumphant in what is perhaps the most attractive of all mister hardy's ponds the oxen
you pictured the meek mild creatures where they dwelt in this story pen nor did it occur to one of us there to doubt over kneeling then
the mode of faith however or rather of delight in the memory of faith is not mister haidee's prevailing mood
he can enter upon a wall without ironical doubts as we see in the song men who march away
how long he cries in a poem written some years ago
when shall the sen of softer politian whereof we dream have sway in each proud land and patriotism grown god lack scorn to stand bondslave to realms but circle earth and seeds
but perhaps his characteristic attitude to war is to be found not in lines like these but in that melancholy poems the souls of the slain in which the souls of the dead soldiers returned to their country in question a senior so flam was to how their friends and realities have kept their doughty deeds in remembrance
and general hell hold out her sweethearts sworn loyal as doves
some fickle and fleet hearts have found the new loaves
and our wives quoth another resignedly though they on our deeds
mister hardy has too bitter a sense reality to believe much in the glory of war
the real will to mister hardy is the world of ancient human things in which war has come to be a hideous irrelevance
it may be thought on the other hand that mister hardy's poems about war are no more expressive of tragic futility than his poems about love
futility and frustration are ever recalling seems in both
his lovers like his soldiers brought in the gray defeated of their glory
lovers are always severed both in life and in death
in beyond the last lamp we have the same mournful cry o the severance
no shade of penn cool or tree or tower while earth and jews will fall in my mound and within the hour still unto yours one woman never haunt are two green coverts
there bring us face to face with an experienced intenser that our own
nothing a tiniest worth have i wrought pondered plann'd no one thing asking blame or praise since the pale corpse like birth of this diurnal unit bearing blanks in all its rays dullest of dull heeded days
it's a sad thing for a body to lac brains when she wants to be a teacher isn't it
pen elope has studied so hard or winter and she hasn't gone anywhere told the other sister wistfully
doris dreamed of pretty dresses all that night and bled about them all the next day
so it must be confessed deep penelope though she would not have but might it it for the world
which she knew that penelope had started out to say a new dress
doris hunter i believe it's an old quilled
listen penelope my dear stories
love to penelope and yourself
your affectionate aunt a della hunter
i don't see it's beauty said penelope we've a great
it may have been pretty once but it is all faded now
tell me dorry does it argue a lack of proper respect for my ancestors that i can't feel very enthusiastic over this hair loom especially when grandmother hunter died ears before i was born
it was very kind of aunt adela to send it said dory dutifully
why the wrong side is ever so much prettier than the right is creamed penelope
what lovely old timmy stuff at not a beat faded
i declare it is as good as mew
well let us go and have cheek said penelope i decidedly hungry
besides i see the poverty poplar coming
it is something to passes and hand noon after all
penelope was surprised as much as the tender sisterly hurt could wished where doris flashed out on her threw fane and the evening on the party with the black skirt nicely pressed and re hung and the prettiest waist imaginable a waist that was a positive creation of vain he rose that sprinkled silk with a girdle and knots of black velvet
so penelope went to blanche's party and her dress was the admiration of every gard there
penelope bethought her altogether charming
she looks us if she had just stepped out of the frame of some lovely old picture she said to herself
my aunt adela gave me give us there materia she stammered
i'm named after her missus fair wether suddenly put her arm about penelope and ruth the young girl to her her lovely old face aglow with delight and tenderness
there you are my grantees she said
when i saw your dress i felt sure you were related to her i should recognise that rose bud seal if i came across it in tibet
and elope was four years older than i was but we were devoted to each other
soon after these our mother died and our house called was broken up
why you i am a very lonely old woman with nobody belonging to me
now she battled missus fair worth's soft old hand affectionately
doris and penelope found their beads and plaids changed in the twin cling of ana
where missus farewel had gone doris and penelope looked at each other
as she slipped into her blue pint afternoon dress her aunt called to her from
aunt jane was standing at the fold of the stairs with a lamp in one hand and the year old baby clanging to the other
she was a big shapeless woman with a wrong good natured face cheerful and father as a sunflower was owned jane at all times and occasions
i want to run over and see how missus biggs be is this evening city and you must take care of the baby till i get back
seen they sighed and went downstairs for the baby
all her days were alike as far u hard work and dullness went but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly
but she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter
the room was more and their box about the kitchen which see they shared with toots more cousins
her bed and the cot where the little girls slept filled up almost all the available space
just at that particular anger one eye appeared to be as large as an orange while the other was the size of a pea and the months exact from ear to ear
sime hated that mills very likely as she could hate anything
her mother had died the day after and sydney there upon had come into the hands of good aunt jane which those books f heard dorry since nothing else was left after the expenses of the double funeral had been a
presently she began to lie with a flush of real excitement on her face
only one answer came to ellen douglas and that was forwarded to herb the long suffering a detour of the map leaf
he wrote that altho his age to burt him from membership in the club he was plenty and the limit was eighteen he read the letters of the department with much interest and often had thought of answering some of the request for crest on debt
he never had done so but ellen doubtless letter was so interesting that he had decided to write to her
would she be king enough to correspond with him
he was two years out from the east and had not yet forgotten to be homesick at times
sydney like the letter and award eat
she never expected to meet john lincoln nor did she wish to do so
in the correspond itself she found her pleasure
join converted breezy accounts of range life and adventures on the far western plains so anian and mould front snag hump drum plain field life that seem they always had the sensation of crossing the gulf when she opened a letter from the bar and as for sid may's own letter this is the way it read as she rotted
the evergreens painted dear mister lincoln
i love life and its bloom and brilliancy a law of meeting new people i love the reole of music the har of laughter and conversation
the manner had been talking what was all more the great noe
as it was i had contradicted him twice and he had laughed and liked it but his both will always have a new meaning to me henceforth through the inside he himself has given me
it is such meetings at these that give life it sparkle for me
you will be wary of my rocks these over her
which she has sympathy and understanding for my every moon
yours sincerely sey made richmond
o jane came home presently and carried away her sleeping baby sydney sat her prayers went to bed and slept soundly and serene she mailed her letter the next day and the month later an answer king
sign did not sleep that night but most restlessly about or cried in her pew
the good woman shook her had
sin they trod the way of the transgressor and found that its tongues burst to bourn and now
you see that road out dark
and there was no harbour or glimpse of distanced visible

this is his place nobody courted the evergreen but myself
i don't understand he said peru ble sedley
oak singing two out her hands in a burst off patient protest
no and you never will understand i can't m you on the stand
everything i told you about it and my life was just imagination
then why did you write then he asked blankly
why do you deceive me
oh i didn't mean to deceive you i never thought of such a thing
i just couldn't ride you about my life here not because it was hard but it was so ugly and empty
and when once i had begun i had to keep it up
i found it so fascinating to
those letters made that other life seem real to me i never respected to meet you
this last four days since she letter came have been dreadful to me
oh but he's go away and forgive me if you can

john lincoln opened the gate and wort up do her

the very day after this octavia opened a fort trunk
evidently something had happened octavia said mister double binny is our old klow who is he

i did not quite understand when mamma tavia she said

what did you understand

that one the reasons less she loathes me so she added
lisa thought deeply forwent she recognized all at once several things she had been mystified by before
octavia smiled the door again
lucia sat thinking her hands clasped tightly
i am glad i came here said at length
i think i shall never be afraid of her anymore
her delicate nostrils were belated and she held her head up her breath came fast there was a hint of adulation in her tone
she walked very fast after she left the house
but it was not against him that lucius indignation was aroused
she wondered if he had heard her last words she faintly he had
it took hold of her shaking little hand and then looked down on her excited face
i had anger she said you have never seen me angry before
i'm on my way to my lady theobald
he held her hair as calmly as before
what are you win to fitter her he asked she laughed again
held her hand rather closer
she has made you very angry said
and then almost before she knew what she was doing she was pouring forth the whole of her story even more of it than she had told octavia
alicia he said i wish you would let me go and talk with lady theobald you should that with little stripe
yess he answered when we go to her
if you will say yester that i think i can promise that you m never be afraid of her any more
the fierce color died over cheeks and the tears brushed to her eyes
she made her daze with a pathetic look
i am desperately love with you he answered in his choirs away
i accompanied my granddaughter to this mis entertainment her leddyship responded

and turning about she walked out of the rip

they all repaired together to the house prepared for their reception and after dinner the emperor of being tired lay down to rest on a couch queen eleanor before long went and tapped at his door and sent word to the king that the emperor was awake
frances with the cardinal de lorraine and the constable the memory soon arrived
on entering the chamber he found the emperor still lying down and chatting with his sister queen who was seated beside him on a chair
yes said charles i had made such cheer that i was obliged to sleep it off

only seven of the attendants remained in the emperor's chamber and there the two savers conversed for an hour after which they moved to the hall where a splendid supper awaited them

three were to care for the reuda five were to move the straight herd from the crows to good fee three bread and crews were told to brand the calf we had collected and the cut of the afternoon before that took up about half the men
the wrist were to make the shore drive in the salty grass
we were the only ones who did go afoot however although the crowds were not more than two hundred yards as distance
between the upright bars of greasewood we could see the cattle and you're the opposite side the men building a fire next the fence
we pushed open the wide gate and entered
one stood waiting for them to finish a sheaf of long j h stamp in irons in his hand
all the wrists squatted on their hills along the fence smoking cigarettes and chatting together
the first rays of the sun sighted across in one great sweep from the remote mountains
homer woulden an old californy john rodin among the cattle
as a loop settled he jerked sharply upward exactly as one would strike to hook a big fish
homer wrapped the rope twice or thrice about the horn and set over in one strip avoid the tidy line and to preserve the balance
nobody paid any attention to the calf
behind him followed his anxious mother her head swing in from side aside near the fire the horse stopped
the two bull dovers immediately pounced upon the victim
it was promptly forked over on its right side
thus the calf was unable to struggle
when once you have had the wind knocked out of you or a river too broken you cease to think us necessarily rough
hot iron yelled one of the bulldogs
marker yelled the other
the brand oppressed the iron smoothly against the flank
perhaps the cap bladed a little lest the heat scorched
the bran show cherry which is the proper color to indicate due plan and a successful mark
then he knit out a swallow tail in the other
it seems to me the great deal of unnecessary twaddle is abroad as to the extreme cruelty of brandon
undoubtedly it is to some extent painful it could some other method of ready identification be devised it might be as well to adopted in preference

one of the little animals was but a few months old so the rider did not bother with its hind legs but tossed his loop over its neck
mister frost's bull cat alone in pictorial history shows the attitudes
and then of course there was the gorgeous contrast between all this frantic and uncomprehended excitement and the absolute matter of fact and reputability of horse and rider
as he knew his business and as the calf was a small one the little beast went over promptly bit the ground with the whack and was pounced upon and held
he would catch himself on one foot scrambled vigorously and in by struggling back to the upright
he could imagine what happened next
this is productive of some fond of it fails
but now the brandon was a full swing
when the nooses fell they turned and walked towards the fire as a matter of course rarely did the cast fell
men ran to and fro busy and intent
sometimes three of four calves were on the ground at once
thus aided dissipated
no more nick calves they announced
then he would spit on his hands and go at it alone
of luck attended his first effort his sorrow chasm was profound there's your little cap said he
would you like to have me toted to you or do you reckon you could toddle this far with your little old iron
toward noon the work fleck
finally homer rode over to the cattleman and reported the brandon finished
the latter counted the marks in his tally book
one hundred seventy sixth he announced
the markers squatted on their heels told over the bits of ears they had saved
but total amounted to but an hundred seventy five

i didn't pay any attention tom for he is quiet
usual i didn't bother with his talk for it didn't mean anything a something in his voice made me turn
he was ling on his side those black eyes of his blazoned me but now both of them saw the same distance
where are my clothes he asked very intense
one little squeeze tug bac your deadly weapons
but he'd been too sick and too long a bit
in a minute or so he came to
now you're a nice sweet proposition said i as soon as i was sure he could understand me
they're safe enough let me have them he begged
now look here said i you can't get up to day you ain't fit
i know he pleaded but let me see them
just a satisfying or passed over his old buds
i've been robbed he cried
where's my coat he asked
you had no coat when i pitch you up i replied
he looked at mean mighty suspicious but didn't say anything more he wouldn't even answer when i spoke to him
after he did in a fair mail he fell asleep

i didn't seem began for two days
then i caught sight him quite aways all

wh mate he answered is just plain gratitude
didn't you save my life and muss me and take care of me when i was not killed
look here anderson nor handy solomon or whatever you please to call yourself i rejoined to this if you're going to do business with me and i do not understand yet just what it is you wanted me you'll have to talk straight
it's all very well to say gratitude but i don't go with me
the devil's a preacher if you may lost your pen feather said he
well it's this then i got to have bow to get there and she must be stopped
and i got to have help with the treasure if it's like this fellow said it was
his money i'll got to have and his money i haven't got and can't get unless a let somebody in his partner
w mia asked why not he retorted
we talk the matter over at length
i stood after a larger party
he strongly opposed this as depreciating the shares but i had no intention of going alone into what was then considered a wild and dangerous country finally we compromise
a third of the treasure was to go to him a third to me and the rest was to be divided among the man whom i should select this scheme did not appeal to him

in a trice i saw myself with beautiful rave and black hair and the temptation was irresistible
oh marilla but a tangled web we weave when first we practice to to see
you here must be cut off there is no other way he can't go out with a looking leg that
with a dismal sigh she went for the scissors
but there is nothing comforting and having your hair cut off because you've died at a dreadful color is there
i'm going to weep all the time you're cutting it off if it wanted a fear
it seems such a tragic thing
anne wept then but laid her arm when she went upstairs and looked in the glass she was calm with to span
yes i will too
i never thought i was vain about my hair of all things but n i know i was in spite of its being red because it was so long and thick and curly
i expect something how we'll happen to my nose next
anne's clipped tad made a sensation in school in the following monday but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for not even josie pye who however did not fail to inform anne that she looked like a perfect scarecrow

of course you must be lane anne said diana
of course it would be romantic conceded jane andrews but i know that i couldn't keep still
but it's so ridiculous to have a red heady lan mourned anne
and a lane was a lily name
your complexion is just as fair as ruby's said diana earnestly and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it
it was splendid to fish for trot over the bridge and the two girls lowed to row themselves about in the little flat bottom dory mister barry kept product shooting
it was an sided that dramatize a lane
those days she said were so much more romantic than the present
they had often gone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing a lay
the black shell having been procured anne spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast
it spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before missus lynde was borne
jan year ranges
it's silly fury to be talking when she's dead
jane rested occasion
lef behind the landing
anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard she was white to the lips but she did not lose her self possession
there is one chance just one
under such circumstances you don't think much about making a flowery prayer
the flat drifted under the birds and then promptly sank in midstream
ruby jane and diana already a winning it on the lower headland saw it disappear before the very eyes and had no doubt but that anne had gone down with it
the minutes passed by is seeming like an hour to the unfortunate lily mad
why didn't somebody come where had the girls gone
her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her
anne charlie
for how on earthy jed up there he exclaimed
it is certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances
what has happened then
asked gilbert taking up his oars
we were playing in lane explained anne frigidly without even looking at her rescuer and i had to drift down to camelot in the barge and in the pot
for a moment anne hesitated
her heart gave a quickly queer little beat
her resentment which to other an older people might be laughable as its cause was a no whit allayed and softened by time seemingly
no she said coldly i shall never be friend with you gilbert blythe and i don't want to be
all right
i'll never ask you to be friends again anne shirley and i don't care either
of course he had insulted her terribly but still
everything i do get to me or my dearest friends into escape
anne's presentiment prove more trustworthy than p sentiments are apt to dare
will you ever have any sinse anne growed marilla
i don't say how said marilla
ever since i came to green gables i've been making mistakes and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming
our extremest pleasure has some sort of groaning and complaining in it would you not say that it is dying of pain
the highest and fullest contentment offers more of the grave than of the mary ipso felicitas say missy temperat permit even felicity unless it moderate itself oppresses
socrates says that some god tried to mix in one mass and to confound pain and pleasure but not being able to do it he bethought him at least to couple them by the tail metre dor said that in sorrow there's some mixture of pleasure
nature discovers this confusion to us painters hold that the same motions and grimaces of the face that serve for weeping serve for laughter two and indeed before the one or the other be finished do but observe the painter's manner of handling and you will be in doubt to which of the two the design tends and the extreme of laughter does at last bring tears
and therefore common and less speculative souls are found to be more proper f and more successful in the management of affairs and the elevated and exquisite opinions of philosophy unfit for business this sharp vivacity of soul and the supple and restless volubility attending it disturbed negotiations
he who dies into and in his inquisition comprehends all circumstances and consequences hinders his election a little engine well handled is sufficient for executions whether of less or greater weight
the romans by this means erected their colonies for perceiving their city to grow immeasurably populous they eased it of the most unnecessary people and sent them to inhabit and cultivate the lands conquered by them sometimes also they purposely maintained wars with some of their enemies not only to keep their own men in action for fear lest idleness the mother of corruption should bring upon them some worse inconvenience
and we suffer the ills of a long piece luxury is more pernicious than war
and this also was one reason why our king philip consented to send his son john upon a foreign expedition that he might take along with him a great number of hot young men who were then in his pay
what other end does the impious art of the glad ears propose to itself what the slaughter of young men what pleasure fed with blood
prince take the honours delayed for thy reign and be successor to thy fathers henceforth let none at rome be slain for sport
let beasts blood stain the veil seine and no more homicides be there acted
it was not enough for them to fight and to die bravely but cheerfully too insomuch that they were hissed and cursed if they made any hesitation about receiving their death
the very girls themselves set them on
beginning of revolt
at this unexpected command the surprise was great on board the ford
light the fires exclaimed some
what worth are stout us
and stuffed the stove with the masts added worn
did you hear me
who spoke cried hatteras
i did said pen advancing towards the captain
i say answered pan with an oath i say we've had enough of it and we won't go any further
you shan't kill us with hunger and work in the winter and they shan't light the fires
if you repeat what the man says answered hatteras i'll have you shut up in your cabin and guarded
a murmur was heard
the engineer followed by plover and worn went down to his post
the steam was soon got up the anchors were weighed and the forward veered away east cutting a young ice with her steel prow
between bearing island and beecher point there are a considerable quantity of islands in the midst of ice fields the streams crowd together in the little channels which cut up this part of the sea they had a tendency to agglomerate under the relatively low temperature hummocks were formed here and there and these masses already more compact denser and closer together would soon form an impenetrable mass
i'm beginning not to answered wall
hatteras still hoped to find an open sea beyond the seventy seventh parallel as sir edward belcher had done
ought he to treat these accounts apocryphal
the next day the sun set for the first time ending thus the long series of days with twenty four hours in them
the men had ended by getting accustomed to the continual daylight but it had never made any difference to the animals the greenland dogs went to their rest at their accustomed hour and dick slept as regularly every evening as though darkness had covered the sky
the doctor by following johnson's advice accustomed himself to support the low temperature he almost always stayed on deck braving the cold the wind and the snow
theres more than one amongst ass who would liked to and imitate them i think
they are cowards mister clawbonny those animals have no provisions as we have and are obliged to seek their food where it is to be found
you hope that hatteras will succeed then
he certainly will mister clawbonny
i'm of the same opinion as you johnson and if he only wanted one faithful companion he'll have two
prince albert land which the ford was then coasting bears also the name of grenelle wand and though hatteras from his hatred to the yankees would never call it by its american name it is the one it generally goes by
on the eighteenth of august they sighted brittania mountain scarcely visible through the mist and the forward weighed anchor the next day in northumberland bay
when the lofty vicinity is about to leer upon his description of the plague that desolated athens one of his modern commentators is sures the reader that the history is now going to be exceedingly solemn serious and pathetic and hints with that air of chuckling gratulation with which a good dame draws forth a choice morsel from a cupboard to regale a favorite that this plague will give his history a most agreeable variety
such are the true subjects for the historic pen
the fall of empires the desolation of happy countries splendid cities smoking in their ruins the proudest works of art tumbled in the dust the shrieks and groans of whole nations ascending unto heaven
thus those swarms of flies which are so often execrated as useless vermin are created for the sustenance of spiders and spiders on the other hand are evidently made to devour flies
ancient traditions speak much of his learning and of the gallant inroads he had made into the dead languages in which he had made captive a host of greek nouns and latin verbs and brought off rich booty and ancient saws and apothegm which he was wont to parade in his public harangues as a triumphant general of yore his spoliation op ma
it was observed however that he seldom got into an argument without getting into a perplexity and then into a passion with his adversary for not being convinced gratis
his abode which he had fixed in a bowery or country seat at a short distance from the city just at what is now called dutch street soon abounded with proofs of his ingenuity patent smoke jacks that required a horse to work them dutch ovens that roasted meat without fire carts that went before the horses weather cocks that turned against the wind and other wrong headed contrivances that astonished and confounded all beholders
it is in knowledge as in swimming he who flounders and splashes on the surface makes more noise and attracts more at tension than the pearl diver who quietly dies in quest of treasures to the bottom
thus when dogmas lead it what the man really and in general wills remains still the same
for these are careful only for themselves for their own egoism just like the bandit from whom they are only distinguished by the absurdity of their means
the deeds and conduct of an individual and of a nation may be very much modified through dogmas example and custom
with an equal degree of wickedness one man may die on the wheel and another in the bosom of this family
it is conceivable that perfect state or perhaps indeed a complete and firmly believe doctrine of rewards and punishments after death might prevent every crime politically much would be gained thereby morally nothing only the expression of the will in life would be restricted
we who here seek the theory of virtue and have therefore also to express abstractly the nature of the knowledge which lies at its foundation will yet be unable to convey that knowledge itself in this expression
he sees that the distinction between himself and others which to the bad man is so great a gulf only belong through a fleeting and lid phenomenon
he recognises himself his will in ever being and consequently also in the suffer
what but the latter is the necessary and inevitable symptom of that knowledge
the opposite of the steen of conscience the origin and significance of which is explained above is the good conscience the satisfaction which we experience after every disinterested deed
the good man lives in world a friendly individuals the well being of any of whom pura gars as his own
therefore although the knowledge of the lot of mankind generally does not make its disposition a joy form yet the permanent knowledge of his own nature in all living beings gives him a certain evenness and even surrender of disposition
for the interest which is extended to innumerable manifestations cannot cause such anxiety as that which is concentrated upon one
the accidents which concern individuals collectively equalize themselves while those which happen to the particular individual constitute good or bad fortune
thus though others have set up moral principles which they give out as prescriptions for virtue and laws which it was necessary to follow i as has already been said cannot do this because i have no ought or law to prescribe to the eternally freewill
further than this it cannot go for there exists no reason for preferring in the individuality of another to its own
yet the number of other individuals whose whole happiness or life is in danger may outweigh their regard for one's own particular well being
so died soges and giordano bruno and so many a hero of the truth suffered death at the stake at the hand of the priests
weeping is accordingly sympathy with our own selves or simply directed back on its source
it is therefore conditional upon to capac you for love and sophy and also fond imagination
when we are moved to tears not through our own suffering but through that of another this happens as follows
either we vividly put ourselves in the place of the sufferer by imagination or see in his fate the lot of human as a whole unconquered first of all our own lot and thus in a very roundabout way is yet always about ourselves that we weep sympathy with ourselves which we feel this seems to be the principal reason of the universal and thus natural weeping in the case of death
for so all he certainly weeps for the fate of the dead but he also weeps w after long heavy and incurable suffering death was to this man a wish for deliverance
they were in the land this people said before the moon had come into the sky
and many of the magicians of egypt who had come with keen disastrous stayed in that city of ea and they talk people spells that could stay the moon and or going and coming in horizon in setting
mitya too his wise daughter knew the secrets taught by those who could sway the moon
for jason was the grandson of crete and corti was the brother of athamas their grandfather
jason took pelias and telamon with him
as they came to the city a mist fell and jason and his comrades with the sons of phrixus went through the city without being seen
the mist lifted and before the heroes was the wonder of the palace in the bright light of the morning
on each side of the courtyard w the palace buildings in one kinetic lived with absyrtus his son and in other chalciope and medea lived the handmaidens
and then a dove flew toward her it was been chased by a hock and media saw the hook's eyes and beak
we pulled away from that place and thereafter we were driven by the winds back to the mouth of the pauses
with him there came the mightiest of the heroes of greece
alretty he has heard of your bitter foes the tsar matai
he with his comrades would subdue them for you
in his heart was filled with wrath as he looked upon them and his eyes shone as a leopard's eyes
and then speaking to the key in a quiet voice jason said
his heart was divided as to whether he should summon his army men and have them slain upon the spot or whether he should put them into danger by the trial he would make of them
it may be that yee are truly of the seed of the mortals
and it may be that i shall give you the gold police to bear way after i have made trial of you
she entered softly and she stood away from her father and be fore who were speaking with him
she had a dark face i was made very strange by her crowned gold hair
no that on the plain of eras yonder i have two fire breaking bulls with feet abreast
then ass the furrows not with the seed that demeter gives but with teeth of a dragging
if you can accomplish this that i accomplished in days gone by i shall submit you and give you the gold fleece
but if you cannot accomplish what i once accomplished you shall go from my city empty handed for it is not right that a brave man should yield up to one who cannot show himself as brave
then jason utterly confounded cast his eyes upon the ground
i will dare this contest monstrous out as it iss
as he said this he saw the eyes of media grow wide as with fear
phrontis and mouse went to where their mother was
and as a mortal apollo sought to earn his bread a mongst men
afterward people wondered at add medicines ever smiling face and ever radiant being
that was before it matter sailed on argo with jason and the companions of the quest
thereafter admetus having the love of alcestis was even more happy than he had been before
a radiant figure it was and had met us knew that this was apollo come to him again
but apollo turned to admit a face that was without joy
what years of happiness have been mine o apollo through your friendship for me said admetus
but still apollo stood before him with a face i was without joy
he spoke and his voice was not that clear and vibrant voice that he at once in speaking to add mede
admits at mete he said it is for me to tell you that you may no more look on the blue sky nor walk upon the green earth
it is to me to tell you that the god of the underworld will have you come to him admetus and met us know that even now the god of wander wold is sending death for you
if one will go willingly in thy place with death thou canst still live on go admetus
and then he came upon an ancient woman who sat upon stones in the courtyard drowning in corn between two stones
there she was sign as he had first known her with her eyes bleared and her knee shaky and with the dust of the courtyard and husks of the corn in her matted hair
he went to her and spoke to her and he asked her to take the place of the king and go with death
but when she heard the name of death horror came into the face of vied woman and she cried out that she would not let death come near her
admetus took the man shrivelled hand and he asked him if he would not take the king's place and goeth death that was coming for him
then admetus went into the palace and into the chamber bed was and he lay down upon the bed and he lamented that he would have to go with death that was coming for him from the god of wander world and he lamented that none of the wretched ones round the palace would take his place
one should go in your place for you are the key and have many great affairs to attend you
now the footsteps seemed to stop
it was not so terrible for him as before
and the words he had spoken he would have taken back the words had brought her consent to go with death in his place
death would soon be here for her
no not here for he would not have death come into the pace
he lifted alcestis throng bed and he carried her from the palace
no more speech came from her
and as for admetus he went within the chamber enough beside the bed on which alcestis sat lane and thought of his terrible loss
to what god do thou sacrifice do
and then ryles felt that another labor was before him
i have dragged up from the yonder world he fought the hounds at guards those whom desperate sound into the realm of the god of thunder old
why should i not strive with death
and what a noble theme it would be to bring back this faithful woman to her house and to her husband
he left the palace of admetus and he went to the temple of the gods
you are held by me death and you will not be let go unless you promise to go forth from this temple without bringing one with you
and death knowing that heracles could hold him there and that the business of the god of landward would be left undone if he were held promised that he would leave the temple without bringing one with him
she was veiled and admitted could not see her features
here is a woman whom i am bring back to her husband i won her from an enemy
this i cannot do centre medicus have had pains enough
then at medicus raised the veil of the woman he had taken across the thus shoulder his house
he now went tom till he came to the house at a door at which he was d knocked visited two or three times
christen i have come to sate a good man at the house
christian sir i am come from the city of destruction and a mar wi monies
i was still bar man this stands at the gate that if i can hear you shall me good things that would help me
he stood as if he with gleeful men and a crown of gold harm near his head
christen what this is mean
then he took him to a large room that was full of dust for it had not been swept and interpreter told his man to sweep it
christian what means these
the new next sought the maid coming to lay the dust so he seem they clean and laid low by faith in the book
just as christian came up to the grouse a sloe they flung its back close to the mouth of the tube where it fell in and i saw it no more
as he stood those and wept lo three broad ones came to him and one of them is sad peace be to thee thou hast grace from thine scenes
tristan gave three leaps for joy and said as he went ah what a place is this blessed cries last two
he went on thus till he came to avail where he sofy men who were in a sound sleep with chains on their feet
christian sirs brands calm you and where to go
from artist and hypocrisy we were born in the land of wine glory and our own our way to mount tine for praise
no yow that he that comes not in at the door the clouds to getting the same met a thief
they told christian that he had no need for care and des bor for long youths have made a law and they could prove that it had been silvery ears
yes said they no doubt of it
and if we getting the goat at all pray what are yard
is not our case as good as yours
i saw then that they all went on till they came to the foot of the heel of difficulty where they was a spring
now when christian got as far as the spraying of life he trended of it and then went of hugh
now hap we up was a case made by the order that hue that those who came by at breath there
timor sad that dah was be hailed they men to clerk but that when they had done half buy they found that they met with more and more risk so decorate fear kim london and all they could do was to turn back
yes said mistrust for just in front of us they lay two bates of prey our calf we knew not if they slept lou that they would follow us enter round wings
yet he thought once more with what he had heard upon the man and then he felt in his cob for his grove that he might read it and find some peace
fell for it but found it not
so he fell daw on his knaves to brave that god would give him graceful dis act and then with that to look for his grow
ho fool that i am said he to slipping the day time so they gave way to the flesh as to use for yeast that breath which lord of the hu hath made but for health that the soul
such was loved of the jews for their sing they were sent back by way the bras sea and i and made tread those steps with wave which one might have trot with joy had it not been before the leeve
how far and i have being on my weight by this time
now by this time he had come to the veil once more wherefore spell he sat down cant but at last as he cast a set plants at foot of the bench he saw his spur which he caught it with haste and putting his cloak
words are too week to tell the jolly of christian when he had got back his rob
he laid it up in the breast of his coat and defence to god
with what a laste bac did he now climbed the hue
ha thought he these beasts renting the knight held their prairie and if they should meet with leading the darr how should i fly from them
the name of the men who kept the lodge of that house was wat for and when he saw that christian made held as if he would go back he came out to him and said is bys strength so small
fear naught between wild these for they are upon by chains and are put here to try the fate of those that habit and to find out those that hath none
keep in the meister of the path and no farm shall come to thee
the nic sawing my dream that still he went on in gay dread of the wide beasts he heard them roar it faded to him no harm but when he had gone by them he went on with jolly till he came and stirring front of the large way a watchful dud
persian su what house it is man rests here tonight
when watchful told her why question hath done there she said what is your name
then christian bent down his head and went within to a house
ivy carved good christian since our love prompts us to take healing to rest let us talk with you fault that should have seen on your way

charity why did you not brat them with you
that they would now come with me nor hath me listen
thus did question talk with his friends still it room dark and then he took his rest into the large room the name of which was peace there he slapped till break of day and then he sent
and they brought out a john bone of the ass with which sensed is such refute and the slain end stone with which dag slew galliot of gath
what the name of his land seth richard

more than this he hath been heard to rail on you my lord who are now his church

christian we must now stand thus let us try to go back
then set trying despair you have no rid to force your way him here the ground known which you lie is mine
they had not much to say as they knew that they were in force
and by this act picked our souls as well
for whether in vast state man would have been master of a man
therefore in the state of innocence man had no mastership of the animals
therefore in the state innocence before man had its spade nothing d spaded that was naturally subject to him
signally disapproved by the order of divine providence which highe governs in theory things by this superior
certainly this is proved from a property of man and bather animals
now whatever his part is pated is subject to what is essential and universal
or therefore the subjection of other animals to man is prop to be natural
they would now however on this kind have been accepted from the mastership of men as neither at present nor they for their reason accepted from the mastership of god his providence has mordan all this
this is signified by the fact that god led it the animals to men that he might give them names expressive of their respective natures
so all animals would have a bit men of their own court as in the presence day some domestic animals obey him
objection one it was seem that in savings men would not have have mastership over all other creatures
much last therefore would he have a big man in state of innocence
therefore since it is by this reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems filling the state land since man had not been in over plans
now in men reason has the position the master and not of a subject
i answer that we must needs omit that in a primitive state they would have been some any quality at least as regards sex because generation depends upon diversity sex and likewise as regards age for some would have been born of others nor would sexual union have been sterile
there might also have been bodily disparity
the quality i else to rise on the parts of nature as both described without any defects of nature
objection one it will seem that in the stifle since m would not have been mess over men
therefore in a state of innocence may not have been subject to man
in other sense mastership is referred in a general sense to any kind of subject and in this sense even p has the office of governing and directing freemen can be caught a master
such a kind of mastership would have existed in the stances between man and men for two reasons
but in the state innocence they would have been low witness able age
on the contrary everything generated discoursing perfect but in the state innocence children would have been begotten by generation
therefore from the first they would happen in perfect em boding the size and power
therefore in the state of innocence there was no need for women to be borne on the contrary nature's processing generation c happen in harmony with manner in which it was established by god
i have been told that mister van brandt is in prison for debts i said
and i saw for myself last night that he had left you helpless
he left me the little money he had with him when he was arrested she rejoined sadly
his cruel creditors and more to blend than he is for the poverty that has fallen on us
even this negative defensive van brandt stung me to the quick i ought to have spoken more guardedly of him i said bitterly
i ought to have remembered that a woman can forgive almost any wrong that a man can inflict on her when he is a man whom she loves
she put her hand on my mouth and stopped me before i could say any more
how doan you speak so cruelly to me she asked
you know to my shame i confessed it to you the last time we met you know that my heart and secret is all yours
what wrong are you talking of
is it the wrong i suffered when van brandt married meat with a wife living at the time and living still
do you think i can never forget the great misfortune of my life the misfortune that has made me unworthy of you
it is no fault of mine god knows but it is not the less true that i am not married and that the little darling who is playing out there with her dollar my child
and you talk of my being your wife knowing that the child accepts me as her second father i said
it would be better and happier for us both if you had as little pride as a child pride she repeated
in such a position as mine
a helpless woman with a mock husband in prison for debt
am i to marry you for my food and shelter
am i to marry you because there is no lawful tie that binds me to the father of my child
that is he is he has now forsaken me he has been forced away
my only friend is it possible that you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife
the woman in my situation must be heartless indeed who could destroy your place in the estimation of the world in the regard of your friends
the wretchedest creature that walks the streets would shrink from treating you in that way
oll what are men made of
how can you how can you speak of it
i yielded and spoke of it no more
every word she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom i had loved and lost
bitterly as i hated the man who had parted us i loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake hopeless infatuation
i don't deny it i don't excuse it hopeless infatuation you have forgiven me i said
or let me deserve to be forgiven
it is something to be your only friend
you must have plans for the future tell me unreservedly how i can help you
complete the good work that you have the gun she answered gratefully help me back the health
make me strong enough to submit to a doctor's estimate of my chances of living for some years yet
a doctor's estimate of your chances of living i repeated what do you mean
i hardly know how to tell you she said without speaking again of mister van brandt
that's speaking of him again named speaking of his debts i asked
why m you hesitate
you know that there is nothing i will not do to relieve your anxieties
never let me tell you the plain truth
there is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison
yes this is his position in two words a little while since he obtained an excellent offer of employment abroad from a rich relative of his and he had made all his arrangements to accept it
unhappily he returned to tell me of his good fortune and the same day he was arrested for debt
this mirror that had been said for her was plainly revealed in those four words
in the eye of the loss she was of course a single woman she was of age she was to all intents and purposes her own mistress
what was there to prevent her from insuring her life if she pleased and from so disposing of the insurance as to give vampa a direct interest in her death
thanks to the happy accident of my position the one certain way of protecting her lay easily within my reach
i could offer to lend a scoundrel the money that he wanted at an hour's notice and he was a man to accept my proposal quite as easily as i could make it
you are quite mistaken i replied
i am only doubting whether your plan for relieving mister van brant of his embarrassments is quite so simple as you suppose
are you aware as the delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to borrow money on your policy of insurance
i know nothing about it she said sadly
will you let me ask advice of my lawyers
they are trustworthy unexperienced men and i am sure they can be abused to you
cautiously as i had expressed myself her delicacy took the alarm
promise that you won't ask me to borrow money of you for mister van brandt she rejoined and i will accept to help gratefully
i could honestly promise that
my won chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge to corso i had now determined to pursue
i rose to go while my resolution still sustained me
kiss me she whispered before you go
it is all your goodness that overpowers me
the next day everybody in the house began to make preparations with a journey
everything was done very leisurely though there was a lot of talking of disputing and the giving of contrary orders
the old porter was there directing as scolding the servants as they piled the rugs and blankets and bags of food and pots and pans and dishes into the wagon
there was quite a procession when that last the big wagon rumbled out through the gateway
behind i came the grandmother and her dewy deck a lita litter or easy chair some between two long poles
besides the family there were many servants and several others walked beside a slow moving wagon
the cook too well with them
good bye shouted little no when miss garden was they went by good bye
they shouted greeting to their friend the potter as they passed them and also to the old factor smeared all over with ashes who sat in a little brick hut by the bridge and pretended to make wonderful cures
this is more fonder going to school c colour as the oxen plodded along their class of dust
these lovely birds are found nearly everywhere in india and in some parts are in quite wild
his long matted hair hung on his shoulders and he was singing his prayers with the help of a rosary of beads which he continually passed through his hands
as the wagon came up a young man who accompanied the holy man ran up and held out a begging bull saying give o charitable people to this holy one
no country in the world has so many beggars as india
many of them are called holy men because they do nothing but make pilgrimages from one secret place to another living solely on their arms that are given to them
when they had eaten their lunch the young people went to explore the garden near them
perhaps they are dogs said mahl a little fearfully but they forgot about dogs and they saw a thicket of sugar can down by a stream
perhaps you can buy some from the man there he is now plowing by the stream said calla
it is the giver water said the farmer as he took a law stuck of cane and gently guided it down to the stream
the snake is another sacred animal of the hindoos and they will not kill or injure when for anything
as they were but to move on again they saw gree crowded dust down the load
i trained out that it was a great and powerful regard goings they on a juny with the another regard or ruler of one of the small kingdoms or states of which modern indios formerly made up
first there came a big elephant all decorated with silk and golden silver
on the elephant's back which was the howdy which was like a big chair of the canopy over it and in this sitting cross light was the roger a big fat fellow dressed in coloured silks and jewels the great diamond set plume in his turban
behind the how does that a servant holding a big umbrella of fond feathers over the rods head
the driver sat on the neck of the elephant and guided the big beast at their crowding him on one side or the other with an iron shod stick or gold
isn't it fine to rill a gown a big ahem
in all the rest of the day the little folk talked of nothing but the great virgin escort
our party came to a halt among many other block carts the owners of which were already sitting around on the ground cooking the suppers or bargaining for fit at a little booth
these they used for plates heaping them up with their boiled rice and curry and fish and our stores puddings and sweets
a supper was being eaten another party stopped at the paris and camped of far away
when the litter was put down the young boy stepped out looking very proud and haughty
his servants at once spread a handsome rug in the ground for him to sit on and rushed about waiting on him taking good care to keep everyone under distant
yes and how he orders every one bell him
around the little brahman's neck was a thin quarter thread which was the sign of his high cast
meanwhile the haughty little ram and ate his supper when this head turned away so no one could see him eat and then growing tired of respectful glasses of the crowd around him he got into his litter again and the servants fastened the curtains tightly around him
everybody said soundly in spite of the fact that one of the servants was beating a drum mess of the night which they really believed was the way to keep off evil spirits
oh the thieves he cried
they're as bad as the baker's
what art guarding so carefully sheer asked her brother
he and hola were walking beset the wagon for a change
the lattices wised sosia and mother and aunt could enjoy the fresh air
there my dolls said the little girl sadly as she patted the wonderly cider
i take them with an offering to the holy river poor little woman
must though sacrifice thy toories too
smarter uncle as he patted her head
chapter forty nine griggs is stubborn
the days glided by with the stiffness and crisp s limbs growing less painful and the pony recovering fast for the clear mountaineer seemed to act like a cure for wounds
every day the came showed the injured animal in better condition
as efforts to move me the longer made christ wins and forget his own pains in those he felt at seeing the must a suffer
everyone was busy for the keeping watch regularly took up a good deal of time

any time the doctor likes
being shot at by fellows with bow and arrow sounds bad enough but there's not much risk here

i'm afraid father will say that the ponies ought to be close at hand

they're always too many red skins about cried chris impatiently
i wish we could charge them boldly ascend them flying over the plains
never to come back again said med sharply
not quite my lads thon you see that were playing a very ticklish game
just then the doctor came to the shelter with a boys having talking ringing with them wotten lovely shooting or rather trying to shoot for he had had no success and they too were talking earnestly about ways and these
oh here your bergs hied the doctor

we must get away some here to some good hunting ground
to the indian sing to be camping or only on the moods
it seemed to me to be hatching up some larger another replied books
then he began to walk up and gal slowly evident lay deep in thought
there he said as made of my mind
it is very evident that we may wait here to our stores exhausted and be as far off their opportunity we seek us every
the indians can wait we cannot and they seem to know it
going to give up young chris's plan said per exploit
no i'm going to put it in force at once we start to night

starve non sense
but there i don't want to make speeches it's our settle gentlemen
well you've got together lookout with coming off
now everyone understand that he is to be ready without showing any watch foot in din scout that there is something on the way
and again when the artists following malicorne ors advice was a little late in arriving and when saint agnan had been obliged to be absent for some time it was interesting to observe though no one witnessed them those moments of silence full of deep expression which united in one side two souls most disposed to understand each other and who by no means objected to the quite meditation enjoyed together
in a word malicorne philosopher that he was though he knew it not had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in the midst of play and with desire in the assurance of possession
in this manner therefore without leaving her room and having no confidant she was able to return to her apartment thus removing by her appearance a little tardy perhaps the suspicions of the most determined sceptic
but the door remain close and neither sight agen nor the painter appeared nor did the hangs even you
go then dearest love said the king return quickly
no no not today sire
i knew but too well that you had not ceased to love me
the valerie with a gesture partly of extreme terror and partly as if invoking a blessing attempted to speak but could not articulate one word
at the moment however when the king threw himself on his knees a cry of utter despair rank through the corridor accompanied by the sound of retreating footsteps
the captain sitting buried in his leather armchair his spurs fixed and the floor his sword between his legs was reading a number of letters as he twisted his mustaches
d'artagnan uttered a welcome full of pleasure when he perceived his friend's son
well my boy he said by what a lucky incident does it happen that the king has i called june
these words do not sound agreeably in the young man's ears who as he seated himself reply upon my word i cannot tell you all that i knows i have come back hum
that the king has not recalled you and you have returned
i did not understand that at all
raoul was already pale enough and he now began to turn his hat round and round in his hand
what they dose is the matters that you look as you do and what makes you so dumb
said the captain to people nowadays assumed that sort of airs in england
i have been in england and came here again as lively as a chaffing
will you not say something
i have too much to say
ah how is your father
forgive me my dear friend i was going to excuse that
d'artagnan increased his sharpness of his penetrating gaze which no secret was capable of resisting
you're are happy about something he said
i am indeed and you know the reason very well monsieur d'artagnan
nay did not pretend to be astonished
i am not pretending to be astonished my friend
i have neither head nor arm do not despise but help me in two words i am the most wretched of living beings oh
she is deceiving ill said d'artagnan not a muscle of whose face had moved those are big words who makes use of them
everyone ah
if everyone says so there must be some truth in it
not for a friend for a son
i do take it you are really ill from curiosity
no it is not from curiosity it is from love
cut another big word
i tell you i love louise to distraction
well suppose it were only that
no sensible man ever succeeded in making much of a brain when the head was turned
i have completely lost my senses in the same way a hundred times in my life
you would hear but you would not understand me you would understand but you would not obey me
oh try tie
i go far even if i were unfortunate enough to know something and foolishly enough to communicate it to you you are my friend you say indeed yes
very good i should quarrel with you
i never complain as you know but as heaven and my father would never forgive me for blowing out my brain i will go and get the first person i meet to give me the information which you withhold i will tell him he lies and and you a killum
and a fine affair that would be so much the better what should i care
you now assume a different tone instead of killing you will get killed yourself i suppose you mean very fine indeed
how much i should regret you
of course i shall go about all day saying ah
what a fine stupid fellow that brag alone was
as great as stupid as i ever met with
go then rowl go and get yourself disposed of if you like
i hardly knew who can have taught you logic but dost take me if your father has not been regularly robbed of his money
grell will buried his face in his hands murmuring no i have not a single friend in me world
i dull fancies monsieur i do not laugh at you though i am a gascon
a carp what do you mean
upon my word i could not know some one told me there was a carpenter who made an opening through a certain floor
i don't know where
and whose room them
i have told you for the last hour that i know nothing of the whole affair
but the pain is in the portrait
while you see to him only that name in your mouth
i did not suppose it will concern you
yes you're right and he made a step or two as if he were going to leap why are you going
to look for someone who attend me be truth
who is that a woman
you wish to be consoled by someone and you will be so at once she will tell you nothing in of herself of course so be off
you are mistaken monsieur replied raoul the woman i mean will tell me all the evils she possibly can
well i admit it
and in point of fact why should i play with you as a cat does with the poor mouth
you distress me you do indeed
wait if you can
i could not so much do worse
ah said raoul snatching eagerly at the pen which the captain held out to him
how very fortunate that is he was looking for you too
she said in the same tone of voice it is not i who am going to speak to him oh then
