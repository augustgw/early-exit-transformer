that he toted to mea and sac my band thet be prudent c be no access and when you are quite recovered i vague to make me of mad with your own h and i will always pay my devotions to rate fort you'll sake
so i mede my mind up and prepared to travel
that day many friends came to see me among others pierre lady who was the best and dearest friend i ever had
mixt day there came a certain nk the mont ago who was also a veryain great frame of mine
i had harbour him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house up site down for the main was subjected to species of dry g which he was always in the habit of screeching with his hands
meanwhile that evil physician francs goal the m a ky attended to my ce with great gill
there they sided me to wait until the duke went by
many of my friend's at court came up to greet me and expressed surprised that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shute by illness the set that i ought to have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke
at this words mistrust din the duke's tana mayas way through all those gentleman and said its all you want to know you shall knowed at this veryain moment
george was a painter whom i have mentioned happened jes then to pass and my s was deal exclaimed there is the man who accuse you now you know yoursel it be true or not
as fut he as i could not being able to leave my feet i asked george if it was true that he had accused me
he deny that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sort
ms r steal re ta it you gallows bird
dont you know that i know it for most certain
george made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not acceded me
then after short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he haled
the duke gazed at me and marveled i was deal alive afterwards evil me take heed to be an honestest man and re gave my health
when i reached home nicolo the male gut came to visit me and told me that i had excited one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had heed my ruin reed with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards tick french lef because my joye ca fromage am who was able to destroy me
i answered that i had d nothing to displease but that he had endured me and to him all the affair about the mein
he repeated get hands quickly as you can and be of goodly courage for you will se heee of edges executed sooner than you expects
a the best attention to my helth gave pier bargo advice about that thing the coins and there went off upon my way to room without singing a word to the duke or anybody ells
you want them to to mortal liz that for roc's tant
you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you i inveterate fo and then devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice i mine to hang you without any fat of yours
it was firmly believed that duke al sad was the san of pope claiming
missa fr casal used also to say and swear by all saints that if he coulde he would have had robed me of the dyes for that meadow
i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more
i thou sent to florence to request blur seein all that he would sand me the reverse of the meadow
nicolo that male gut to whom i had retarded wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher lord seen not foray he had replied he thinking night a day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better invent one out of my own head when i had finished it i might bring it without a hesitations to the duke for this would be to my advantage
i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate and pressed the word forward to my best ability
this being so as he was a fellow of much humor we used offered to laugh together about the great credit he had gain
i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling peas ready and at a veryain long range brought two of them down with a single ball
i never used to shots m than one ball and was usually able to heat my mark at two hundred cubits which cannot be done by other ways of loading
i lifted at my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we mak haste for room
we have had succeeded in a massing two hundreds ounces of silver enough i tress to erect a handsome brown figure

all things which follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of god must always exist and be infinite or in other words are eternal anden infinite through they said attribute
proof conceive if it me possible supposing the propositions to be denied that something in salome attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of the said attribute and that at the same time it is fite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought
can its nature infinite
must necessarily exists
we have now grated therefore thoughte not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of god does not naturally follow from aids nature conan so far has it is absolute thought foras conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of goot which is against our oss
and beyond the limits of the duration of the idea of god suppose in the latter at some time not to have existed not to be going toe exist thought perforce have existed without the idea of god which is contrary to our h pots four we suppose that thought being given the idea of godness cary flowed there from
bearing mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from from gods absolute nature
coy hands it follows that god he is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is ins colic phraseology gods cause of the being of things t cy rare
coy individual things are nothings but modifications of the attributes of god or modes by which the attributes of god are expressed in ay fixed and definite manner
